## SECTION 2 : EXECUTIVE SUMMARY / PAPER ABSTRACT
This project sets out to build a recommender system to aid parents in searching for a suitable pre-school for their children based on their needs, preferences, and constraints. The objective of the recommender system is to help parents speed up their research and decision for selecting a pre-school. This is especially pertinent in todayâ€™s world of exploding information on the internet such as in the online forums, pre-school websites, social media, parent groups. 

The project team proceeded to set up a pre-school recommender application as it would be useful for parents selecting preschool for their children. Given that current competitor sites lack recommendation and sentiment analysis functions, as well as the disparate information about school fees/reviews/programme/curriculum about the net, it was timely for our system to plug some of the existing gaps to serve the real needs of parents who wish for an integrated and useful recommender for their preschool choices. Data utilised were obtained from the preschool sites, google reviews, preschool aggregator sites and government information sites. 

Leveraging on the Intelligent Systems knowledge taught in lectures, a knowledge database about preschools was collated and preprocessed. Publicly sites information were scraped to give details on range of information for each preschool, from fees to opening hours. The Python tool was utilised to provide user history matching, business rule filtering. Finally, a similarity algorithm would generate top 3 preschool matches and output it for parents in a user-friendly front end for their consumption. Forms would enable parents to input their preferences and retrieve the results in a intuitive interface. 

The project team experience on the task was fulfilling. Everybody learnt a lot in launching this system with the knowledge learnt on Intelligent Systems. Other potential users of the preschool site may include PR residents or education researchers seeking to learn more about preschool choices for their children. In future, this system can receive user feedback, be further iterated to include more features, refine the model, and evolve the technical architecture for scalability and automation.
