MindSpace @ Tai Seng (Grantral Mall) | After School Student Care for P1-P5 | MindChamps Enrichment for P1-P5,"Deciding to send our kid to MindSpace @ Tai Seng,  Grantral Mall was a game-changer; we were glad we made that decision.  The dedication and hard work put in by the center managers and trainers is nothing short of remarkable. From coaching the kids to managing the center's operations, planning events, and keeping us informed about our child's progress, they handle it all with such finesse, it's like watching a well-oiled machine in action.  Before MindSpace, our child seemed to exhibit learning challenges and behavioral hurdles: throwing tantrums when asked to do home work, unable to comprehend basic arithmetic, and disliking classes.  We were pleasantly surprised that after going to MindSpace, he is actually looking forward to attend MindSpace. His attitude towards homework has improved, and he is showing significant improvement in behaviour. We were happy when the school teachers told us that they noticed an improvement with our child.  It's got me thinking-if MindSpace can work wonders for our child, maybe they have a secret recipe for adults too. MindSpace, any chance of an adult program?

MindChamps Chinese PreSchool @ Thomson,"  Kids learn faster than adults and, being 50% Chinese,  I believe it is essential that our children be exposed to the Chinese culture and language early on. This will enable them to tap into the advantages of being proficient in one of the most widely spoken languages in the world today.  We were concerned initially whether our child would feel overwhelmed being thrown into a new environment with a new language. However, young children adapt quickly and before we knew it, he started acquiring new vocabulary and was responsive when I communicated with him in Mandarin.  Since he started attending school at MindChamps Chinese PreSchool @ Thomson, he learned many words, both in Mandarin and English. He can converse with a basic level of understanding and enjoys the songs and stories in both languages.

Star Learners @ Sengkang Sports Centre | Preschool & Childcare,"  As parents, we might have given them some hard time from time to time, but these teachers from Sengkang Sport have performed outstandingly well in our opinion. We would like to highlight their strength and give thanks to teachers of N2 for the effort that they have put forth this year.  Teacher Liza ============= This year we manage to see Teacher Liza on a more prominent role as the N2 English teacher. As parents we are very happy on how she manages the class. She is firm when needed, as N2 class is more discipline and in order when going on excursion and also gentle when students needed her. As our daughter easily get bored and learn fast on certain situation,  Teacher Liza will at times teach her some new songs and also learn basic math calculation while waiting for the kids' turn to go to the toilet, making learning fun by using elements around the environment. From my understanding it is not part of the curriculum at the point of time, and we are much appreciated that Teacher Liza have taken the initiative to do so, to keep our daughter engaging and make learning fun for her. our daugther will always come home waiting to learn to count more stuff and even teach us parents new songs. At time Teacher Liza has try to follow up on how daugther is doing at home to understand our daugther character more in dept. We truely appreciate her effort and care for our daughter.  Yu Liaoshi =========== Last year we were really impressed with Yu Liaoshi. And this year is no different. We truly appreciate Yu Liaoshi patient for teaching our daughter Chinese. Our daugther will come home excited to tell us all the beautiful Chinese words to practise and dance. Coming from a non-chinnese speaking family, at times it is very hard to follow up with our daugther's Chinese language. Yu Liaoshi have been very helpful explaining to us parents on what our daugther have learn in school and also show us books during previous PTC on our daugther favourite Chinese book in class and share abit about the book story. As parents we love to follow up with our daugther after school and Yu Liaoshi have gone her way to write down the han-yu pi-yin on the home activities for Syafiqah, making it possible for us to do so. We truely appreciate that she have gone out of her way to assist us and be very patient on teaching our daughter.  N2 Teachers ============ For the past 2 years, our daughter had to deal with teacher from her class leaving the school. And at times we are worried for our daughter development as she could get very attached to a teacher one day and suddenly her favourite teacher leaving the other day. We are very happy that Teacher Liza and Yu Liaoshi have been around for the whole of this year to guide our daugther development. Both of them are excellence teachers and work in sync with each other. Making our experience with the school engaging, interactive and worry free as we know our daugther is in good hands. As parents we would love to see both Teacher Liza and Yu Liaoshi be guiding our daugther through K1, as some of her friends (Best friends included) will be leaving school for MOE kindergarten next year. And having both Teacher Liza and Yu Liaoshi will really help our daugther go true these hard times.  School Development =================== This year we saw much of the school rebranding and we parents really welcome and appreciate the school effort to make things easy for us parents and teachers. There were bugs in the school app in the beginning, which was expected for any new software. At times bugs like not receiving app notification, not receiving invoices and etc happen and the school principle and teachers have been very helpful in relaying information to parents, to bridge in the gap.  We are happy that the app has made things easy and more secure for parents to view school activities photos, invoices, e-consent, buying of uniform and much much more.",0.25043943576552263,daugther,Communication_Factors

I was told the incidents of HFMD was minimal however the exact month my son was there, he was down with HFMD, and on the 3rd month too. During one incident when he was down with fever, the teacher locked him up in the room on L2 till dismissal (when they should have just called us to pick him up earlier). Few months later, we observed bruise marks on his arms on a few occasions. The principal and teacher said it‚Äôs due to ‚Äúplay with other students‚Äù. After so many unpleasant incidents, we decided to forego the deposit and take my boy out from Cherie Hearts at Charlton. How would we even want to continue that last month (after reporting these unpleasant incidents to the principal and teacher)?  These kind of experiences can leave scars on children for years! In fact, they even leave psychological scars / guilt on parents - I‚Äôll think why I gave this childcare centre so many chances? What else happened to my kid (prior to my discovery?). Could all these be avoided if only I trusted my gut feel, (as well as granny‚Äôs observation outside the centre) and take him out earlier?  Am so glad nowadays, the policing of childcare sector is more stringent. There‚Äôs definitely a lot of improvements in the childcare space!

Kinderland Preschool (Yio Chu Kang),"Thank you Ms Susan,  Ms Elva,  Zhang laoshi and Ms Vernon for being so patient in guiding the K1 children for the marching band. We truly enjoyed the performance. We appreciate the hard work put in by the team. Thank you for nurturing the children over the years,  Thank you Ms Susan, teachers, and all the parent volunteers for their hard work to make this event a success. I'm awfully proud of my daughter's marching band performance and this cannot be done without the school. My kid has lots of fun and I think giving everyone a medal is a very nice touch at the end! However, it would be nice if event can be made shorter in future as it can be quite tiring for the kids and a few of the younger siblings were seen sleeping and being cranky.   My girl attended this school since N2, the principal and teachers are amazing. They also have a very fantastic outdoor area which my girl gets to goes every morning and evening. Kinderland YCK also has the marching band - the only preschool that has it which my girl loves to participate.   My both kids graduated from kinderland yck and it has been great.
