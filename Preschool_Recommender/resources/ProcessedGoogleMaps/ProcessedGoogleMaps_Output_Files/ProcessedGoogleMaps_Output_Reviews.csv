Agape Little Uni Thomson Centre,"My baby girl joined the centre when she was around 1yo, because my Indonesian helper injured her hand and we needed the extra help. I'm really grateful for all the help and love Agape provided for her and the family. They extended their help in applying for additional subsidy due to low income, with frequent updates on the progress and how my child was doing. The infant care was also well structured and my child grew smarter in her time there. I felt really supported in this time of difficulty. Agape was the nearest centre available to join on short notice without a waitlist of 2+ months, probably due to price, but it's really worth it.",0.1318181818181818,"[('help', 3), ('centre', 2), ('child', 2), ('time', 2), ('baby', 1), ('girl', 1), ('helper', 1), ('hand', 1), ('family', 1), ('subsidy', 1), ('income', 1), ('update', 1), ('progress', 1), ('infant', 1), ('care', 1), ('difficulty', 1), ('notice', 1), ('waitlist', 1), ('month', 1), ('price', 1)]"

Agape Little Uni @ Cecil Pte Ltd,Decided to withdraw my baby after his first day as we decided he was incompatible with the teachers (bad crying even though it was just 2.5hrs in the school) but was still charged the full month amount with no room for negotiations to prorate the amount as I could not give the 14 day notice required in the contract.

Our son started school when he was 3 months old and honestly, he didn’t cried and adapted super well. We saw how much our son loved school, to the extent that he cried on so many occasions when he was going home. He is probably the only child who isn’t happy seeing his parents at the door..

Blossom Creative Centre (Bedok)," My eldest graduated half a year ago and my youngest is still with Blossom. They enjoy Blossom tremendously. I love fetching them from Blossom, listening to them chat about what they learn and enjoy in school. My eldest really struggled with phonics in her kindy years and her form teacher worked closely with me to support her in grasping reading. She was aware of my eldest’s introverted personality and took into consideration of that while teaching her. My girl breezed through reading by graduation. Blossom is also aware of the struggle parents have with Chinese language and has done up a solid curriculum to help children transit to P1 Chinese well. My eldest still enjoys singing with her younger sister of the Chinese songs and poems her blossom teachers have taught her. Blossom teachers really make learning fun for them! Academic aside, the thing that really stands out for me for Blossom is the teachers. They are warm and caring and are often able to quickly give feedback on my children whether it is during PTM or casual chatting during pick up, which reflect their understanding and love for my children.

Cherie Hearts @ Charlton Pte Ltd," My kids have been to 3 different kindies, 2 in Singapore & 1 in Malaysia. Out of the 3 kindies Cherie Hearts Charlton is the best. My older girl was a very shy girl that hides behind me all the time & never answers people. After she was in Cherie Hearts for 3 months she was a much more confident kid, talks to people & not afraid to go up to the stage to dance. This kindie keeps the parents updated after every semester on what the students have learned during the semester. When my kids were in the other 2 kindies I had no idea what they were taught in school. During the CB when all the schools were asked to close the teachers quickly prepared worksheets for the students to bring home for the online classes. My kids were practically occupied the whole day. Morning was teaching & talking to the teachers & friends via skype & in the evening was story telling & singing & dancing.

E-Bridge Pre-School 670 Edgefield Plains,"There are many mosquitoes in the weeds in front of the school. I get bitten every day. The wounds are red, swollen, hard and itchy, and it takes more than a week to heal. There are also many wild dogs gathered under the bridge leading to the bus station outside.

Wild dogs appear at playgrounds and school gates every day, making it very dangerous to pick up and drop off children‼ ️Today I also saw a child being chased by a wild dog.

Joyous Learning," Joyous Learning is a gem in the field of education. The reasons are as follows: 1. As a boutique enrichment centre, the communication between centre and parents is top notched (for example, special schedule changes and reminders are sent in a timely fashion and this helps busy parents a great deal in the management of their children's extracurricular lessons). 2. There is a lot of ""heart"" in the modus operandi of the centre. Firstly, they do not pre-select students. I understand some centres conduct proficiency and aptitude tests prior to enrolling the students to ensure strong good results statistics.

The teaching materials are thoughtfully planned and designed to challenge the children and level up their proficiency in the respective subjects. 5. The teachers are dedicated and passionate about their craft. This is the game-changer that sets them apart. I will like to send a special shout-out to Mr. Marcus Goh. My child enjoys lessons tremendously at Joyous Learning under the fine tutelage of Mr. Goh. At the same time, he engages his students by creating a stress-less learning environment that encourages participation and the fun methodology applied creates a higher retention rate for the knowledge imparted. He has made a difference and made learning, for a lack of better word, joyful (and meaningful). 4. Value-added information is uploaded on their blog posts and newsletter on a very regular basis. This is a very altruistic act of sharing with keen learners who are unable to gain access to paid enrichment/tuition lessons. The side effect of being a student of Joyous Learning Centre is that regular school curriculum has become somewhat boring and unchallenging but that's a good issue to have, isn't it?",0.16285714285714287,"[('child', 3), ('subject', 2), ('lesson', 2), ('student', 2), ('learning', 2), ('educator', 1), ('heart', 1), ('opportunity', 1), ('love', 1), ('mastery', 1), ('teaching', 1), ('material', 1), ('proficiency', 1), ('teacher', 1), ('craft', 1), ('game', 1), ('changer', 1), ('shout', 1), ('tutelage', 1), ('time', 1), ('stress', 1), ('environment', 1), ('participation', 1), ('fun', 1), ('methodology', 1), ('retention', 1), ('rate', 1), ('knowledge', 1), ('difference', 1), ('lack', 1), ('word', 1), ('value', 1), ('information', 1), ('blog', 1), ('post', 1), ('newsletter', 1), ('basis', 1), ('act', 1), ('learner', 1), ('access', 1), ('enrichment', 1), ('tuition', 1), ('effect', 1), ('school', 1), ('curriculum', 1), ('issue', 1)]"

They don't straight away judge your child, they will find root cause and then get it treated from there. She have graduated and in primary 2 now. I have another son who's been with the school since he was 18 months and we all thought he was mute cause he was quiet all the time until he went kidz meadow and start singing nursery rhymes and talk alot. Time flies he's graduating soon. This year 2023 i enrol my 18 months son with medical history diagnosed. 2 school rejected him because they don't want to take risks and if I insisted to send my son to their school I must be with him at all times which I felt defeated the purpose of sending him to school.

Second - she's constantly having runs and I could see intact corns and brown rice in her waste.

Even a fellow mummy said the same thing about her infant son, who's also at the Centre. During pick up, at times we will glance at her through the viewing glass. She will be sitting down and stoning. No evening activities or toys to engage her. Alot more issues which I will not go into details.

Little Big Pre-School Pte Ltd," I am sharing with you this review since I know the owner and centre manger personally for quite some time and my son attended this pre-school for many years. This is lovey boutique pre-school in the heart of Telok Kurau. One of their differentiators is driving the kampung spirit and focus on togetherness in D15. The school is coming with a nice outdoor space, though not fully sun covered. It is fair to say the hard product is a bit outdated and the school has been facing some teacher attrition post covid. But I truly respect the consistent leadership with a strong focus on their core values. All kids and parents are treated equally, regardless of status or race. Safety, respect and supporting each other are just some values you can feel are lived here day to day. Miss Chai, the manager of the school is coming with more than 25 years of experience in early childhood education. While she has been running large international schools in Sweden for many years, she was born and raised in the East Coast District of Singapore. Her ability to switch seeming less between English and Mandarin and her consultative and loving approach has been acknowledged and praised by many parents.

I've observed how well the new students adapt; many start initially shy and nervous but develop into confident, happy children. - The school takes a collaborative approach to nurturing the children. We shouldn't be outsourcing our parenting, and I appreciate how this school embraces that. If you're an involved parent and are willing to put in the work, you will find plenty of opportunities to be part of your child's growth.

She's a confident public speaker due to the myriad of speaking platforms provided by the school.

She eats stuff that she normally wouldn't eat at home, like brown rice, soft tofu, and seaweed. Oh, the wonders of peer pressure! - The class composition is diverse and inclusive. I love how my child's class is made up of children of different socio-economic and family backgrounds, and with different developmental needs. As a result of her interactions within such a diverse class, my child is growing to be such an adaptable, kind, and empathetic individual. - The kids have scheduled outdoor play time, which is great.

My Little Gems Private Limited,"I am very lucky that my daughter has been admitted to My Little Gem, a kindergarten full of love, and it has been a year in the blink of an eye. We moved to Singapore from Hong Kong more than four years ago. Due to the impact of COVID, we waited until our daughter turned three years old before starting N1. She quickly adapted to school life. It has now risen to N2. This kindergarten, which is based on Buddhist thought, does not actually have many religious elements. It mainly teaches children to care for the people and things around them. It also encourages children to go into the community, visit nursing homes, visit markets, participate in volunteer activities, etc. , so that children can not only learn to think positively, but also experience and practice the values ​​of great love advocated by the school. We communicate in Cantonese at home, and we are taught in English and Chinese at school. However, we are not required to stop using Cantonese and respect the parents’ decision. Another unique feature of My Little Gem is that it trains students to practice meditation from an early age, which can improve concentration and help learning. Through various courses in the classroom, in addition to learning basic skills such as reading and writing, teachers will also take into account other aspects, including the development of physical coordination, personality growth, artistic creativity, etc. A learning progress chart is also provided every week so that parents can have a deeper understanding and help children review at home so that they can make greater progress. What impressed me most about My Little Gem was attending the graduation ceremony and student performance held by the school at the end of last year. Both the little ones in the PG class and the older brothers and sisters who were preparing to enter elementary school were all very involved in the performance. . The teachers behind the scenes really spent a lot of time and effort to lead a class of children under seven years old to give such a wonderful performance.

There were two teachers one English speaking and one Chinese each class and each teacher gave opposing feedback. This glorified bi-lingual system also meant in my case some sort of feud between the two of them with complaints regarding unequal pay and treatment from the school ! This feud was so obvious when 6 months later I was finally able to sit in one of the classes. I decided to open up and say something upon seeing the viral video of child abuse at a Woodlands nursery recently.

The teachers are incredibly resourceful and love using natural materials and recycled materials as toys, learning tools and props. 4. They teach the kids about sustainability and the environment. Their actions speak louder than words, eg bringing in a company to teach kids how to recycle water in the garden, engaging with a company that has sensors/equipment to “talk to trees”, and moving away from parent-packed snacks to reduce the use of plastic wrappers + inculcate healthier snacks ie fruits provided by the school . 5. Good balance between being play based, but still having an effective method for teaching (eg Spalding for reading) to prep the kids for “big school” 6.

Raffles Kidz @ Bukit Panjang â Best Childcare Centre And Preschool," We enrolled our son in RKI @ BP in Dec2021 when our son turned 19months old. Initially, we chose RKI because there were no other preschools with vacancies and we thought we'll move him out when we get another preschool with lower school fees. In the end, we decided to stay with RKI for these reasons: 1. Our son shows great improvement in many areas even though he just started less than a year ago. 2. Our son looks forward to go to school everyday now. He only cried for the first couple of days of school. That shows how capable the teachers are to be able to get our son to adapt to a new environment. Our son has mild symptoms of autism so getting him to adapt to a new environment was definitely not easy. 3. The teachers are very prompt in replying to us and are very supportive! Shoutout to Teacher Geri and Meiyu Laoshi. Always updating us on our son's behaviour and learning. 4. We like the curriculum and activities in school too! Especially when we get the photo updates from the teachers every now and then on what they did in school. 5.

Teacher to students ratio was considered comfortable. The teachers are attentive and quick to update on things. And I adore most on how the teachers care for each child. The school principal also took time to know all the children. It's amazing how they can remember little bits of each child's character and behaviour. The effort in getting parents involve in the children school activities are also commendable as they are always very encouraging. Environment of the school was accessible via public. School curriculum includes outdoor play almost every other depending on weather, which was wonderful because we love our child to play more outdoors. They also include waterplay and cookery lessons which our daughter enjoy immensely. The have quite abit of excursions for the children that do not requires parents to take time off. I guess as working parents, although it wud have been lovely to be there to experience the journey with the children, it was nice not being pressured to take time off from work to go through all the school trips. I understand there are schools that do not allow the child to participate out of school trips if the parents are unable to join. This is good because our child still gets to experience as much out of school education despite our working hours (mind you I do 3 shifts so this was truly appreciated by me). The only few downfalls that we experienced was deductions of school fees and costs for events and trips. We had to multiple times get bounced back and fourth between the school and the bank saying that deduction was unsuccessful despite sufficient value. Ended up paying personally at school almost every month. And the cost to attend graduation concert and some of the outdoor trips is quite steep for preschoolers.

As I said, every teacher, including the principal, is extremely patient, loving and caring. Our son even has a special connection with the auntie who cooks the food and always greets him with an enthusiastic “high five”. Every day children do lots of interesting activities to activate the children’s minds and body. This happened even when we had the lockdown in April/ May. There were online lessons and we were sent activities that children could complete at home. In addition, we are sent pictures and videos via WhatsApp of our babies almost daily. I truly appreciate the time invested in taking those pictures and videos because they make my day at work. Having such close communication with the teachers makes us feel more involved and at ease, reassuring us that our boy is happy, and he is learning new skills with his little friends.

Unfortunately the parents only noticed this 3-6months in when the child started to show signs of fright to speak because the poor child felt no one understands him in school. The child is now in another school with an English main teacher and the child’s progression in speaking has since improved very well with additional help from enrichment classes to help over come the fear to speak.

Teachers came and left, and each one of them had always left a deep impression on my children, especially Nayli, who is graduating this year. The smiles that the teachers put on every morning, greeting the children when they are dropped at school, makes it so welcoming for the children. To us parents, who might always look like we are in a rush to drop them off so that we can run off to work, seeing the smiles and the cheery ""Good morning!"" or ""Zhao an!"" never fails to uplift my mood for the start of the day. The staff were truly accommodating, especially in ensuring that Zuhaily is being managed better in the school, which at times will mean that Nayli has to be taken out of her class to reassure Zuhaily that everything will be alright. The staff have always been prompt in updating the goods and bads that happened in the centre albeit I cannot deny the fact that my heart jumps everytime I receive a call from the centre. However, deep down inside I know that the teachers are trying their best to do as much as they can. The occasional video updates given to me.

His pacifier was not cased up, probably for convenience, but this also meant the pacifier could be dragged on the floor wherever he went. 2. His cheeks was full of dried mucus when receiving him and then the teacher became conscious to help and wipe him. What's the point?

Star Learners @ Yung Ho Pte Ltd,"Honestly I don't blame the teachers, but I blame the management. Obviously they are overwhelmed. I am not going to go into the whole story abt the shortage of pre school teachers. What I am appalled at is that, the management is not helping us as parents. The 2nd HFMD was the last straw. Prior to that anytime the boy was sick, it is hard on us as parents to take leave and care for him. When we notified the school we were withdrawing the child for his well-being, instead of being understanding. They could still pull out the company policy and tell us that we had to serve 1.5 notice because our notice came in after the start of the month and as such the last day had to be the end of next month. So while we nurse the boy back to recovery and search for another pre school, we can't start him as we are held back by this pre school and its company policy which is probably just to make another month worth of fees before releasing us.

Not convinced by the first option, we visited over twenty infant cares before coming accross Sunflower Baby House.

Ms Angela and her caring team made us feel reassured and confident about the school before joining and since Day 1 after we did. We’ve never looked back and love how the team had always been so loving with our children. Being foreigners, we had no family support and having our kids at Sunflower enabled us to juggle between work and the family with the peace of the mind. The school feels like a little family thanks to its great caring team and the parents we became friends with. The teachers always took the time to engage and discuss with us, whenever we had any question or concern, they would always address them. Aside from that, what stood out is the Chinese level. It is very impressive compared to other schools that claim to be “bilingual”. Our kids loved learning Chinese thanks to the laoshi they had who have been at Sunflower for decades.

You would think that the teachers will pay more attention to the new infant attending a new school but it does not seem to be the case. I completely understand that accidents can happen but not when it is the first day of school and they are most definitely not short-handed if they are a ratio of 1:3. 7. The school is an air-conditioned facility. After showering they will put the baby in the play area where the FAN is blowing directly at them. 8. My son fall sick 3 times in the less than one month he was there. The first time was runny nose, second and third was back to back stomach flu. He had ongoing runny nose for few weeks. I had to take a lot of AL and CCL due to these. There was no notification from the school of related cases. I believe this is negligence from the school part. 9. The principal is really clueless. The school app does not allow teachers to communicate w the parents directly and only the principal has access to the school communication app. During the first day, when i asked the principal about the access for the school app, she merely said,” er, you should have access w the app cause same as prev school.” She obviously doesnt know what she was talking about.

Since infancy, he has problems attending several prestigious childcare centres in town area. He is now in K2, 5 months to Primary 1. I have decided to look for a childcare with a good review of the principal. I told the Principal Ruth truthfully that I need help to integrate him for school readiness, and I am entrusting my son in her hands. TADAH! All my 5 years of worries and struggles are non-existent in this centre! My son fits in readily and happily! REJOICE! It is also our great blessing that his K2 Teacher Maria is special needs trained. For the first time in his life, my son is willing to attend a school outing without me! And wakes up for it!

We knew that there are CCTV cameras installed on the center and we asked principal for an explanation. After a long delay, the principal told us that it was likely due to a circular teaching tool which had sharp edges and that the babies were not well seated on chairs and the tool was passed around among the babies. In addition to the cut, we noticed that almost all babies cried when a china teacher carried them. Upon further enquiry with a former teacher, we found out that the teacher scolds the babies everyday and we also saw that she shook an infant violently when the infant cried.

Superland Pre-school (Bukit Timah)," My daughter has had a wonderful 1.5-year journey from Infant Care to N1 with Superland Bukit Timah and as parents we could not have been happier to find this school from day one. It gave us a positive vibe visiting this school from day one till now. The bright, beautiful space and colorfully decorated, clean classrooms made us feel reassured that this was a safe, hygienic and cheerful environment for children. Both the teaching and non-teaching staff are very warm and friendly towards children and know them by their names! My child is happy at drop-offs and comes out cheerful at pick-ups which makes us feel very comforted as parents that she has a good time at school. The curriculum structure as well as activities towards building social, language and gross motor skills have laid a sound early foundation. Her teachers are very caring and very responsive to questions/requests. We also receive regular photos and updates/reports of the ongoing learning and play activities via the app and that is always nice to see as parents. We are especially thankful to Tr.

Infant care to playgroup experience was fine until we noticed he often came home with big mosquito bites mainly due to the school allowing the children to eat outdoors which have higher exposure to mosquitoes. Poor hygiene issues mainly also arise from the fact that they don’t shower the children after outdoor play. They only change clothes after play and the children sleeps sweaty. All the above issues caused ill health to my toddler. We withdrew our boy due to an incident of negligence whereby our boy was allowed to wear socks in the music room and he bumped his head with big bruises on the forehead. Our heart broke, and when we went to pick him up from Superland Outram, it was highlighted to us he have many ulcers at the back of his mouth again.

The Little House (Montessori)," TLH is an outstanding preschool! I highly recommend it. The principal (Mrs. Katherine) is also the founder and owner of the school. This means that she has final say of how to run the school and sees ideas thru to implementation. It is extremely valuable to have consistent leadership. She anchors and ensures that the school is run up to her high standards and principles, and based on sound research of what is best for children. The children are taught to be socially aware, responsible and considerate. These and other good habits are inculcated from day one resulting in the school having a calm and cheerful atmosphere. It’s like a home away from home. The school motto is “help me help myself”. There is a focus on confidence and initiative in the context of community. Mrs. Katherine is the model of a skilled and confident person. What better way to teach confidence than to exemplify it authentically! The teachers she selects are of high quality and quite a few have been at the school for many years. This means it’s a stable environment for the children. My child often tells me how much he loves interacting with his teachers. It is a language-rich environment and I have never heard the teachers speak bad English or Mandarin. This is a mixed age Montessori school. Older children are paired with younger ones and the kids learn social graces within community, not simply in theory. Older ones learn patience, leadership and kindness towards younger ones. Younger ones experience this and have confidence that one day they can in turn be in that role, rather than all children waiting on adults to serve them. All kids learn that they are active, useful and integral parts of their community thru everyday interactions.

The Little House (Montessori),"I was really caught off guard by 4 children coming up to me to see if I wanted a drink. They were going to pour water for me and host me! It is a true testimony as to how TLH respects children as individuals, believes in their abilities, and empowers them, to the point that the children were not unduly afraid of me, and saw it as their responsibility to host me, the guest in their school. I had visited 10 schools before deciding on this one and even my 1st runner up school is a far cry from what happened during my tour here. The other schools basically told the children to not disturb the adult talking with the principal and go do their own thing. Whereas at TLH, while no one interrupted the conversation, the children were instead encouraged to step up. They are not treated like a distraction to the “real work” that only adults do, but they are empowered to play key roles in the “real work”. Imagine the feeling of accomplishment and personal value they feel, and how eager they would be to step up and take initiative again! It shows me how the teachers view the children and their abilities, and natural opportunities that can be seized to build the kids up. To me, these are very well trained and intelligent teachers, and I would be safe to partner with them for my child’s learning journey. There is an individualised learning plan for each child. Academic lessons like math and reading are done 1-1. The fast learner does not have to sit in a bored classroom learning what he already knows. The slower learner does not have to feel shame and be discouraged to try their best. The kids abilities are intimately known by teachers because of this 1-1 interaction.

The Schoolhouse by Busy Bees (Sembawang Country Club),"PATS’s brand quality does not need to be elaborated. I chose pats sembawang country club campus mainly because of its following advantages: 1. Have your own outdoor activity area and the teachers do take the children outdoors on non-rainy days: at least 2 hours of outdoor activities a day are the best protection for children’s eyes, so I put outdoor conditions first when choosing a kindergarten. First consideration. As well as the school's own play facilities, the school also shares some facilities with the golf club, such as the swimming pool, and the children have two water days each month. 2. Rich extra-school activities: There are actually plenty of activities for children to learn and play in school, but the school also carefully arranges some out-of-school activities, such as taking the children to the stadium to experience football, playing with excavators, and experiencing Experiencing Chinese opera and so on allows children to learn, feel and experience in happiness. 3. Teacher-student ratio: Compared with the ratio of 1:10 or 1:14 in many government kindergartens, the teacher-student ratio of pats sembawang is smaller. In many classes, two teachers teach 10-12 children. In Doudou class, there may be two teachers. A teacher only takes care of six or seven children, which is undoubtedly a great advantage for taking care of children's emotions and helping them adapt to school life. 4.

After this year of study and life, he has learned a lot of knowledge and learned how to be humble, cooperative and helpful in activities with children. She also has more valuable language skills, imagination, curiosity and enterprising spirit... All of this is attributed to our teachers. From the careful arrangement of daily recipes, from the meticulous weekly teaching arrangements, and from the honors children receive every time. We know: In order to give your children a good enlightenment education and for their continuous growth, you have been working hard. Parents are very happy to see their children’s gains in the past six months and encourage their children to actively participate in various activities and stage performances to help them learn how to improve their performance skills and abilities.
