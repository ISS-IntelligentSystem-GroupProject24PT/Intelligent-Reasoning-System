"""Deciding to send our kid to MindSpace @ Tai Seng, Grantral Mall was a game-changer; we were glad we made that decision. The dedication and hard work put in by the center managers and trainers is nothing short of remarkable. From coaching the kids to managing the center's operations, planning events, and keeping us informed about our child's progress, they handle it all with such finesse, it's like watching a well-oiled machine in action. Before MindSpace, our child seemed to exhibit learning challenges and behavioral hurdles: throwing tantrums when asked to do home work, unable to comprehend basic arithmetic, and disliking classes. We were pleasantly surprised that after going to MindSpace, he is actually looking forward to attend MindSpace. His attitude towards homework has improved, and he is showing significant improvement in behaviour. We were happy when the school teachers told us that they noticed an improvement with our child. It's got me thinking-if MindSpace can work wonders for our child, maybe they have a secret recipe for adults too. MindSpace, any chance of an adult program? Sign me up; I'm ready to experience that transformation firsthand!",0.09313725490196079,Topic 1,"['teacher', 'school', 'child', 'kid', 'care', 'principal', 'son', 'parent', 'good', 'thank', 'time', 'day', 'centre', 'go', 'year', 'daughter', 'love', 'like', 'month', 'update']",MindSpace @ Tai Seng (Grantral Mall) | After School Student Care for P1-P5 | MindChamps Enrichment for P1-P5

"Sending my niece to Mindspace@Tai Seng is the best education decision I have made! My niece (a typical heartlander) became more interactive, can articulate and express herself better. When I run into logistics coordination problems, the business owner, Ching & her team staff helped me with sincere and stress-free assistance with great initiative. It had helped me in dual capacity as in improving both education where I can focus on work concentration.

"I chanced upon this after school student care through a leaflet sent in my mailbox. Initially, I did not think very much about it till I met my sister who then just recovered from a nasty episode of COVID. I could see that she was definitely not as fit as before and on top of that, she shared that her grandson is attending several after school enrichment programmes in the week. Being the day carer for this boy, she has to make multiple trips per day. There I was looking at the leaflet for the second time that week and realised that this could solve some of the issues my sister was facing. I called up the centre and expressed my concern on behalf of my sister and Ms Ching Ching has been very attentive and empathetic of our situation. She assured me that her centre is able to help us overcome the challenges that we are facing. We attended the open house last December and we liked the place as the setup of the centre is conducive, is bright and the layout is fairly spacious. Everything in there are new as we understand the centre is at its start-up phase and most importantly, it is very convenient for us either by MRT or bus. Without much hesitation, we signed him up and since then, we have been in touch with the trainers, who are also very responsive with our queries and concerns on the day to day basis. The trainers update us frequently on his learning, behaviour as well as suggestions for areas of improvement which we can work with him at home. Due to the close working relationship between the trainers and us, we do see a significantly improvement in his social skills and his academic achievements. I did notice that he is now willing to work with a more challenging peer in this small group setting which otherwise he would avoid even being near to them in a school setting. This value is definitely very well inculcated and many thanks to the trainers in this centre who constantly remind them about peer inclusion and showing empathy towards others. Lastly, we really appreciated the variety of the lunch menu and the quality of the food. The picky eater (my grand nephew) is now open to eating out of his comfort zone. This is definitely a bonus for him and us. To date, we are pleased with his development and we will continue to work with the trainers for the betterment of him.",0.18973581973581974,Topic 1,"['teacher', 'school', 'child', 'kid', 'care', 'principal', 'son', 'parent', 'good', 'thank', 'time', 'day', 'centre', 'go', 'year', 'daughter', 'love', 'like', 'month', 'update']",MindSpace @ Tai Seng (Grantral Mall) | After School Student Care for P1-P5 | MindChamps Enrichment for P1-P5

"Curriculum The MindChamps curriculum and values are unmatched, from day 1 of enrolment, the Mindchamps team addresses your champ by name, and in time to come, my kid addresses each and every one of his subject teacher by name, mutual respect at a young age! Location One of the rare locations in the city where you can literally drop off your kid at the driveway and walk 5 metres to the school, no need to rush into carparks and basements, drop off and pick up is a 1 minute affair, not to mention the MindChamps team makes the effort to recognise your vehicle so your kid is ready to go the moment you walk up to the door, never had to wait longer than a couple of minutes. City Campus The centre lacks an inhouse indoor playground but they do make use of Marina square's public playgrounds for the kids to enjoy themselves, a hidden benefit - my kid seldom goes goo-goo over indoor playgrounds anymore as he does it on school time anyway, and getting him to leave one is easy, the school has conditioned him well. Talk about raising a city kid! Staff Hospitality I recall the first time we visited the centre in the morning, most of the kids were running into the school, and it's with no surprise, there's always a very warm welcome at the door greeting every kid good morning as they get ready through the health checks before school, so they get all hyped up about school the moment they step through the doors. Chinese Education There is a dedicated chinese lessons and teacher for every level, for a family that speaks only English at home, my kid picked up a remarkable amount of Chinese words for his age. Summary A famous chinese proverb goes ""三岁定八十"", if you're looking for a place for your kid to develop with the right values, principles and literal/motor competency, I'll bet my last nickel with the folks here at Marina MindChamps. Update: My sister saw the development in my kid and registered both her elder daughter in the Mindspace program and transfered her younger daughter to a Mindchamps near her place, kudos to the MindChamps team!",0.23554029304029306,Topic 0,"['teacher', 'child', 'school', 'kid', 'love', 'good', 'environment', 'staff', 'learn', 'parent', 'care', 'thank', 'nurture', 'preschool', 'activity', 'ms', 'experience', 'learning', 'great', 'fun']",MindChamps Performing Arts PreSchool @ Marina Square

"""My son has been in MindChamps since he was 20 months old but transferred to MindChamps Sengkang in June 2023 when he was in N2 because he didn't seem to enjoy his last centre as much as I had hoped he would. Transferring him here was the best decision I've ever made. The teachers in this school are outstanding in every way - they are a truly passionate, nurturing group of educators who love what they do and the children that they teach. And this love is quite evidently reciprocated by the students, who can't seem to get enough of school! My son longs to return to school even on weekends. Thank you for making school a very happy place to be at, as it should be. :) Shout out to Ms Hepzi, Ji Laoshi, Ms Ross, Mr Jeremy, Ms Anne, Ms Amenda and Ms Sharlene for always being so warm and attentive. If you're looking for a preschool that not only excels in its curriculum but provides a safe, nurturing and genuinely compassionate environment, look no further.

"My kid is usually slow to warm up in schools. He appeared very comfortable with the teachers and school in just 3 weeks. The things he learnt is in 6months is way much more than the 7 months he was in the previous school. I believe that school is not just about phonics, language, math and words, but also about knowledge around the world. He often comes back sharing about what he learns and some happenings in school. This is something which was not observed in previous schools. All these attribute to the committed teachers. They genuinely want to know more about the kid and make the effort to engage the kids. The support and nurturing environment is definitely one of the factors that allow him to open up faster. They help the kids to excel further in their strengths while encouraging them to work on their weaknesses. The curriculum in the school emphasises all aspects of development. The kids also get some exposure to performances that helps to build up their confidence. I love the open communication with the teachers. The teachers are very approachable and we do get regular updates about their progress in school. No regrets in sending my kid to the school.

"In June, we enrolled our daughter at MindChamps, and the transformation we've witnessed in her has been truly remarkable. She now effortlessly manages her daily routines and eagerly looks forward to attending school each day. One of the aspects we appreciate the most is the thoughtfully designed curriculum. It caters to the holistic development of our child, addressing her social and emotional skills, which we hold in high regard. MindChamps excels in guiding her social behaviors and provides ample opportunities for her to shine in public settings. Under the leadership of the dynamic Principal, Ms. Amenda, MindChamps has organised community outreach events for the children to participate in. In a short period, our girl has been involved in events such as the ""Grand mall opening ceremony"" and the ""Mid-Autumn Festival performance."" The teaching staff at MindChamps is truly exceptional. Their dedication and professionalism shine through in every interaction. We would like to express our heartfelt gratitude to Ms. Lydia and Ji laoshi, our daughter's form teachers, for their unwavering patience and timely feedback, which have played a significant role in her growth. We also want to extend our appreciation to Ms. Chantille, our daughter's English program (MRW) teacher, for her guidance and support, which have enabled our girl to read English books fluently at her level. When it comes to Music, Mr. Jeremy has been a fantastic mentor, and our daughter now enjoys playing the violin and other instruments. Last but not least, a big thank you to Ms. Hepzi, who consistently adds a fun element to Nuro Move. Your contributions to our daughter's overall development are greatly appreciated. Every day, our daughter discovers something new at this preschool. It's the perfect environment for her to learn, explore, and flourish. In conclusion, we wholeheartedly recommend MindChamps @ Sengkang to other parents seeking a nurturing and comprehensive early learning experience for their children.

The engagement and support from staff and teachers is excellent. Aside from updates through the App, face-to-face conversations are genuine and teachers are extremely approachable. Through our observations and communication with the teachers, we can feel that they genuinely love children and want the best for them. We love the curriculum as well which is pretty comprehensive even for PG level children, where they get to explore the various themes in music, gym, gourmet lessons. It has been an overall positive experience for our family, where we now see our boy showing much more interest in communicating and responding with people.

"My experience with this preschool has been nothing short of exceptional, and I am beyond grateful for the positive impact it has had on my sons. When my older son first started at MindChamps, he never spoke a single word of Mandarin. However, with the incredible guidance of his Chinese teacher, Ji Lao Shi, he has opened up to the language in a way that I couldn't have imagined. It's truly remarkable to see how he has progressed and embraced Mandarin under Ji Lao Shi's care and instruction. One of the things I really love about this school is the extensive exposure it provides to children. My sons have had the opportunity to explore various interests, including learning musical instruments like the violin at such a tender age. They even had the chance to perform at a public venue, and I could see how much they enjoyed the experience. It's heartwarming to witness their enthusiasm for learning and self-expression. The teachers at MindChamps, especially Ji Lao Shi, Miss Lydia, Miss Chantille, Miss Joy, Li Lao Shi, and Ling Lao Shi, are exceptional. They played a pivotal role in easing both my sons' transition into the school. It's evident that they genuinely care and love my children, which, as a parent, is what matters most to me. The support and nurturing environment they provide make all the difference. I must also commend the principal, Miss Amenda, for her attentiveness towards parent feedback. It's truly amazing to have a principal who values and listens to parents' opinions and concerns. Academically and holistically, my sons have shown significant improvement since joining MindChamps Preschool Sengkang. I wholeheartedly recommend this preschool to other parents seeking a nurturing and enriching environment for their children. It's been an incredible journey, and I am excited to see how my sons continue to thrive at this wonderful institution.

"In the blink of an eye, my 5-year-old sister has been attending mindchamps@Seng Kang for more than three months. I have become accustomed to watching her rushing into the school gate every day and listening to her happily sharing all kinds of random thoughts after school: We went to the supermarket to buy some food every day.

Occasionally, she would make superfluous remarks in the conversation, play the piano to an ox; or take out a Level 4 Oxford tree and relish it in the corner. When reading, the old mother felt really happy. After all, every parent hopes that their children can develop a good habit of independent learning as they grow up, and have a happy and splendid childhood.

MC excels in many areas, such as a holistic approach of balancing academic learning and inculcating a love for learning through fun and varied activities, working with us (including connecting fortnightly despite their busy schedule) to correct bad behaviour in school and at home, and most importantly, the Teachers make all the difference! The Teachers can be both firm and fun-loving (depending on what the occasion calls for). The kids love their Teachers! Bearing testament to this was how the children spontaneously hugged their teacher as she ushered them down the stage at the year-end concert!

The guidance，patience，and unwavering support have played an instrumental role in her growth. Your creative teaching methods，warm smiles and encouragement will be etched in her heart. You’ve not only taught her lessons from books but also lessons about kindness，respect and the journey of expiration. To her dear classmates，each of you has been a source of joy and inspiration. From shared laughter and adventures，you‘ve made her everyday at school unforgettable. The bonds you have formed are special，and I am grateful for the friendship that have taken root during your time together. I want to express my heartfelt gratitude to all of you. The memories created will always be cherished，and the lessons learned will continue to guide her.

As such, we are often anxious and always skeptical, if any school can guide her well. The Teachers have been very kind and supportive. We can always see improvements in her languages, behavior and social attitudes. She often gives us surprises, for example, keeps her own toys, asked for permissions to do certain things, know how to be kind or apologize when something goes wrong, speak proper sentences, able to share her toys and food etc On top of that, the school activities also help her to further develop the mind, writing her very first alphabet and initiate to sit at one corner to flip the books and using her little fingers to go through all the sentences. We did not imagine our active child who just turned 3-year-old, is capable to do all these by herself. We look forward for more of her good character being build up in this school.

Both my children are here from PG to K2 and never once do we have to worry if they would be mistreated or whatsoever at school because the teachers here are experienced and delicated. The outdoor playground is huge and there is water play from time to time. Both my children started off shy and reserved but the teachers managed to help them build up their confidence till they moved on to Primary school as confident individuals. We are so grateful to the teachers here who helped us mound their character so well. They learnt responsibilities, to care and to share. Most importantly, both built up a deep love for attending school, they both were happy and loves attending MindChamps to the extent that they just wish they can turn back time and stay on as babies. Thank you, MindChamps East Coast (OneKm - Kinex).",0.35833333333333334,Topic 0,"['teacher', 'child', 'school', 'kid', 'love', 'good', 'environment', 'staff', 'learn', 'parent', 'care', 'thank', 'nurture', 'preschool', 'activity', 'ms', 'experience', 'learning', 'great', 'fun']",MindChamps PreSchool @ East Coast
"Both my kids are with mindchamps@onekm. What makes the school special is that it has a strong sense of family. The bigger kids would help the little ones and they have friends across levels. The main teachers are also with the school for a long time. Been with the school for the past 5 years, we have become friends with the teachers and some of them taught both my kids. The kids are not only well prepared for p1, they are also exposed to current affairs and values (eg. The recent Thai cave incident was discussed in class).

"Our children (K2 and N1) are with Mindchamps Preschool @OneKM, or Kinexis, both started at 1.5yrs. They loved every bit of it and looked forward to school every morning, as they never complained about having to attend school. We've seen how well they progressed over the years and we are very pleased to have made this wise choice. We'd highly recommend Mindchamps Preschool to parents who prefer a more holistic approach to teaching and learning. This is particularly important to nurture lifelong interest in learning and to help my children cope with the world ahead of them. Besides, we are also happy with the activities-filled curiculum, perhaps that is the reason why our kids were often entusiatics learning new things. The teachers are always helpful, patient, kind and cheerful, which never failed to amaze us with their passion and dedication to their job. Kudos to the Principal Mrs Koh who did a fantastic job! Definitely a big thumbs up for them and should no.3 come along, we wouldn't hesitate but stick to Mindchamps!

"We enrolled our son with Mindchamps Kinex during the circuit breaker through a friend’s recommendation and we never looked back. We were apprehensive initially because of the timing that we enrolled our son, but that quickly dissipated. The school took social distancing and personal hygiene very seriously, requiring the children to wash their hands frequently. They even specially sourced a face shield for them. Pre-covid days, the parents were able to sit in with their child during the first week of school for a smooth transition. This was something we couldn’t do. Rachel understood our anxieties and for the first week, she attached Miss Pearlyn with our son to slowly warm him up to the environment and they gave us constant updates to assure us. Rachel and her whole team of teachers are very loving, passionate, dedicated and nurturing. Every single teacher regardless of the level that they were in charged of, were familiar with every child in Kinex from PG to K2. The feeling they gave us was that the entire school was one big happy family. All the teachers there have been teaching there for a considerable number of years. Attrition rate is low and they have a great seamless system and clockwork going on. This has to be attributed to Rachel’s strong leadership. No child or parent gets left behind. They were there every step of the way with us right from the start, responding to our many queries, allaying our fears and making sure our child and every child gets to fulfill their best potential in their time. They were there to encourage them when needed, yet being firm with him and rewarding him when he does something positive. Besides focusing on the curriculum, Rachel and the teachers also made sure the childrens’ social skills and inculcation of values were not missed out on either. Those to us were more important than the curriculum itself. We did not have to worry one bit putting our son with Mindchamps Kinex whilst working. We know that he was in the best hands. It was very sad and heartbreaking that we had to leave kinex for another branch because we relocated to the other end of the island. We have Rachel and her stellar team to thank for setting such a good foundation in our child that he transited well in the new school. I cannot thank especially Rachel, Miss Neesha, Miss Anna, Miss Pearlyn, feng lao shi, Miss Camille enough. Thank you all girls for all the heart work that you do. ❤️",0.22030129870129866,Topic 1,"['teacher', 'school', 'child', 'kid', 'care', 'principal', 'son', 'parent', 'good', 'thank', 'time', 'day', 'centre', 'go', 'year', 'daughter', 'love', 'like', 'month', 'update']",MindChamps PreSchool @ East Coast

Staffing - Principal, Teacher with low attrition and change. And Professional in communication and the program plan (English proficiency eg. grammar, Chinese proficiency eg. For engaging children with little interaction with Chinese at home) 2. Safe Environment - how they handle misbehaviour, cleaning and sanitisation, and separate bathroom for boys and girls to protect their modesty from young. 3. Holistic education - Not just academic focused but overall exposure to different learnings at their young age (eg. Gym class, confidence in speaking in front of peers, simple cookery class, artwork, playtime in playground, music etc) 4. No homework for parents except for K2 (spelling only).

Specifically I’m very please with the amount of mandarin he is speaking because the exposure to mandarin at home is very limited . The school also does a very good job in communication and sharing the day to day activities with parents. Teachers will regularly send photos of my son at school to let me know what he is doing and how he is doing . There are also a lot of programs planned out for the children to ensure that they developed into all rounded kids . I will definitely recommend the school .,0.21921428571428572,Topic 1,"['teacher', 'school', 'child', 'kid', 'care', 'principal', 'son', 'parent', 'good', 'thank', 'time', 'day', 'centre', 'go', 'year', 'daughter', 'love', 'like', 'month', 'update']",MindChamps PreSchool @ City Square Mall

"I want to share my experience for the past few months with MindChamps Paragon. Some background of my son, who is turning five this year. He has been attending an International school in Brunei since he was two and a half years old before returning to Singapore on the 31st of November. The school with huge compounds, three canteens, excellent facilities, and large playgrounds, even just for kindergarten level. When he was in the international school, he was neutral, neither eager nor enthusiastic about school. During covid lockdown, he didn’t care whether he would be going to school the next day or not. After returning, I decided to enroll my son in Mindchamp Paragon. At first, I wasn’t very optimistic due to the limited area to play compared to the international school in Brunei. But this is what it is when we are in a scarce land city-state. As I would like my son to master his mandarin better, at home, we are only allowed to converse in mandarin as I would want my son to master at least in his mandarin speaking. During the enrolment, I specifically emphasized to the Teachers to encourage my son to speak more mandarin to him instead of English. To my surprise! After the first day of school, my son loves going back to MindChamps Paragon. Every day, even on weekends, without fail, he will ask me if there’s school tomorrow. He had shown so much interest in going to school that he did not have that enthusiasm in his previous school. After the first week of attending Mindchamps paragon, he has improved his mandarin speaking. In the following weeks, my son has shown significant improvements in his eagerness to write and draw, which he has lack of previously. Besides, the teachers went above and beyond to ensure the children were comfortable and well taken care of. This is the first time I have seen such a high level of dedication by the teachers, especially Fan Laoshi, Ms. Cammy, and Ms. Lee. After a long absence from lockdown, when school reopens, toddlers will typically take about a week to accept and adjust to new environments and routines. What took my son a week in the previous school, in mindchamps paragon, only one day. To my surprise, he was eager to go back to school the following day without the first day crying drama or pleading to go home, etc. It’s such a pity that we will be relocating again in the coming month. If it weren’t for relocating, we would be glad to continue with mindchamps paragon as long as the highest level mindchamps provides... My son and I are going to miss this excellent school!

"How to begin .. I can honestly say that we ( me and my son ) both miss Mindchamps very much. Liam practically grew up with this preschool since he was before 2 years old. From PG to K1 .. We appreciate the attentiveness that most of the Teachers give to the Champs professionally and the time they took to brief us every single day during pick up time. Some teachers would do the extra miles to attend to champs with special needs and to be able to understand that each house hold is different. Their roles at school were as equally important as mom’s roles at home, they are giving knowledge and implanting discipline that sometimes parents failed to do at home. We are VERY grateful for the Teachers. I apologize if I missed some names but I honestly hope that it won’t affect any of their good dedications and caring, from Miss Eunice, Wu Laoshi, Fan Laoshi, Miss Bev, Miss Cam, Ms Cleris, Ms Nadia, Ms Jasmine, Mr Jay .. even the previous Ah Yis who used to work there at PRG. I hope the COMPANY can further notice all of Teachers contributions and dedications to the children, can appreciate and care for the Teachers as well, since they play the most important roles in the school ( brand ) development and champs qualities.

"I can still remember the time when I was trying to find the best preschool in Singapore for my then two-year-old boy. I visited a few schools, but none could beat the “This is the right one” feel of MindChamps PreSchool at Paragon. The school was brimming with positivity and light. Children wore big smiles on their faces, greeting their friends, teachers and even schoolmates’ parents; teachers were warm and energetic, and the ambience was bright and colourful. They had me at ‘hello’. Within a year in MindChamps, he is not only speaking in full sentences but spewing out bombastic words that I’ve never heard of in my life. When asked what he likes best about his school, his response is, “My friends and teachers”. I think he doesn’t know how to say it yet, but I believe it’s more than just these two fundamental reasons for him liking school. I think to him, schooling in MindChamps is like an adventure or a journey to exciting discoveries. My husband and I too, are very fond of MindChamps.

The curriculum is good but the environment is not so homely and lack of personal touch. My daughter was absent for many days and hospitalised but there wasn’t a single call from school to check on her. I don’t see principal greeting students in the morning like what other kindergarten does. The checkers (normally not the teachers)will do health check with a serious face and normally doesn’t greet good morning to students. I personally feel the childcare was managed like an enterprise than a school. I have no doubt the curriculum is good but I do hope the environment can be more nurturing.,0.22043650793650796,Topic 1,"['teacher', 'school', 'child', 'kid', 'care', 'principal', 'son', 'parent', 'good', 'thank', 'time', 'day', 'centre', 'go', 'year', 'daughter', 'love', 'like', 'month', 'update']",MindChamps PreSchool @ Holland Village

"Sending my boy, Asher to MindChamps has been a great decision that both of us as parents have made. Mindchamps has been a great platform for Asher to develop in terms of cognitive and personality. Prior to sending Asher to Mindchamps, he was shy and quiet but Mindchamps has moulded him into an outgoing little boy after 3 years. Apart from that, he has developed into a boy who is observant and shows interest in many things that are around him that has also helped in turning him into a more outgoing person. His frequent questions and enquiries on his surroundings have also contributed to his creative mind because Mindchamps has provided many opportunities for Asher to grow up at his own pace but not forgetting to assist him step outside his comfort zone. In term of cognitive development, Asher has enhanced in language skills especially in English when he learned a lot of vocabulary, syntax and communicative skills through the well-designed syllabus that Mindchamps has developed for the kids. Most importantly, Asher is not a great user of Mandarin but his Mandarin has improved tremendously for the past years, allowing him to be able to communicate more effectively with others. Asher always compliments and enjoys the story telling sessions by the teachers in Mindchamps and he always comes back home telling us what he has learned from the story telling sessions. Sharing has not been his strength but Mindchamps makes him a better one and also builds him to be a conscientious person plus an all-rounder. We are looking forward to see more greatness in him as he progresses to K2.",0.2591049382716049,Topic 0,"['teacher', 'child', 'school', 'kid', 'love', 'good', 'environment', 'staff', 'learn', 'parent', 'care', 'thank', 'nurture', 'preschool', 'activity', 'ms', 'experience', 'learning', 'great', 'fun']",MindChamps PreSchool @ Holland Village

"Time flies so fast. In the blink of an eye, this is already Jiayi’s last year at Mindchamps. In more than four years, she has grown from a babbling baby to a lively and cheerful girl. School has a great attraction for her. Every morning when she wakes up, she wants to go to school as soon as possible. When she picks her up every day, she ""complains"" about why her mother comes so early and she is reluctant to go home. Fortunately, every teacher at school gave her enough patience and tolerance, and helped her grow better in her study and life. When Jiayi comes back, she often talks about the gentle and patient Mother Zhou, the cheerful and enthusiastic Miss YuSing, the serious and responsible Ji Laoshi, the meticulous Teacher Frances, the humorous Teacher Klement, the talented Teacher Hui Sin, the story-telling Teacher Jasmine... too many The teacher helped her become a better version of herself. Jiayi is a child with a lot of personality, and her thinking is relatively mature. She often shares her anecdotes at school with us like a little adult, and often borrows the words of teachers or parents to argue with us. She likes to ask more and more ""why"" when it comes to learning. She likes to read books, listen to stories, and share the knowledge she learned in school. When getting along with her friends, she likes to share every detail of life with the children, and she also learns to be polite and humble and actively help others. In life, she is a veritable ""little housekeeper"". While doing her own thing well, she also worries about all the things around her. Sometimes she often brings us unexpected surprises. She likes the study tour activities organized by the school, which can help her broaden her horizons and increase her knowledge. We are very happy to see Jiayi’s growth, and we are very grateful to the school and teachers for their efforts. We also hope that she can better enrich herself in the remaining time. Kindergarten is her first step in contacting the society. We are very happy and Let’s work together with Mindchamps to describe her best moments and leave her with the most unforgettable memories!""",0.3286174242424242,Topic 1,"['teacher', 'school', 'child', 'kid', 'care', 'principal', 'son', 'parent', 'good', 'thank', 'time', 'day', 'centre', 'go', 'year', 'daughter', 'love', 'like', 'month', 'update']",MindChamps PreSchool @ Holland Village

"My daughter (now in K1) has been at this school since playgroup and my son just started playgroup this year. Enrolling my son was an easy decision seeing how my daughter has blossomed over the years at mindchamps. The smaller class sizes ensure that students get personalised attention from teachers, who are truly invested in their learning. Lessons, while conducted within the theme/topic for the term, are nonetheless adjusted to the children’s interests, ensuring that the children remain excited to keep on learning. Indeed, the teachers make mindchamps special. It is clear from conversations with them that they are extremely dedicated to their craft and caring for the children, not just the children in the class they teach but the children across all levels. My son’s current teacher, who also taught my daughter in her nursery years, still interacts with my daughter regularly and provides me with feedback. My daughter’s teachers are also constantly looking out for my son and providing me with updates on how he is adjusting to school. I’m ever grateful and thankful to my mindchamps village for providing such a safe and loving environment for my children to learn and grow.

"This preschool has inept, unresponsive franchise owners, whose poor management has caused high staff turnover and distrust from many parents. Our child was with MindChamps Thomson Chinese Preschool for K1 and K2, graduating in 2023. We chose this school as we wanted a Mandarin-immersion programme near our home. While our child had good teachers throughout the two years there, unfortunately, the school was very poorly managed. During this period, 4 principals resigned (the 5th principal will be starting in late-Jan 2024), along with all 6 of our child’s teachers. What is worse is that these 6 teachers left with little to no notice period given to the parents or children. This is despite the management being aware that they resigned several months ahead of time. They deliberately required the teachers not to tell the parents, giving no time for a proper farewell and showing little regard for the relationship between the teachers and the children. The school environment was therefore very unstable, making it difficult for children to form a relationship of trust with their teachers. Just imagine how your child would feel if they started trusting a teacher, only to see her suddenly depart, time after time. During the first wave of resignations in 2022, we were among a group of 9 families who collectively wrote a letter to the franchise owners to express our grave concern. We were deeply dissatisfied with the high staff turnover and their decision to announce the teachers’ departure at very short notice (i.e. 1 day before her last day). Notably, the owners did not bother to respond to us at all. Instead, the new principal tried to assure us she would right the ship. She worked hard and seemed sincere, but soon resigned as well. While we certainly considered changing school, eventually we kept our child there because of the existing friendships and the new teachers were good. It’s also rather disruptive to change school with just a year to go. The K2 year was more stable – we thought the management had finally met minimal standards. Unfortunately, that was not to be the case. In mid-December 2023, both the K2 teachers left the school abruptly. Once again, the management kept the news from us until 3 days before the teachers’ final day. This was baffling, given that the parents had already paid the school fees for December, so they could have given more time to allow the children to process the end of these treasured relationships. From these actions, it is clear that the franchise owners of MindChamps Thomson are lacking in management and people skills. Worse, they do not listen to feedback. Principals did not stay more than 6 months, they could not explain the decisions of the franchise owners, and good teachers left very suddenly, in an unnecessarily disruptive manner. We have no confidence in the franchise owners, and believe parents should know about their history before deciding to enrol. Ultimately, while the teachers are good and committed, the preschool management is not child-centric. Here is a final example: MindChamps Thomson scheduled the K2 graduation concert on 3 December, obviously to get parents to pay for that month’s enrolment. Several families planned to travel in Dec to visit family overseas etc and thus appealed to have the concert earlier. However, the management rejected the appeal. As a result, several children were not allowed to join the graduation concert, even if their parents were willing to pay the $373 concert/graduation package. This is simply mean and profit-obsessed. Most other preschools hold their graduation concerts in November, and even October. We think teachers, parents and children deserve much better.",0.0693823831535696,Topic 1,"['teacher', 'school', 'child', 'kid', 'care', 'principal', 'son', 'parent', 'good', 'thank', 'time', 'day', 'centre', 'go', 'year', 'daughter', 'love', 'like', 'month', 'update']",MindChamps Chinese PreSchool @ Thomson

"Kids learn faster than adults and, being 50% Chinese, I believe it is essential that our children be exposed to the Chinese culture and language early on. This will enable them to tap into the advantages of being proficient in one of the most widely spoken languages in the world today.

However, young children adapt quickly and before we knew it, he started acquiring new vocabulary and was responsive when I communicated with him in Mandarin.

Kudos for the MC@Punggol Northshore teams! If there is any improvement that I can made comment of it, will be 1) I hope they will be more “parents and child day at school” on some special occasion such as festival celebration/ father’s or mother day’s celebration etc. (but to be fair we are only at MC for 3 mths, they might hv planned it on diff occasions) 2) More photo update to parents esp for younger age group as is hard to ask them how’s their days in sch due to their language aren’t fully forms yet.

"Our girl’s PG to K2 journey in MC Punggol is coming to an end this month and it has been an extremely enriching experience for her. We could see significant improvements in her behavior in the past 2 years and the MC Punggol team deserves a shoutout for it. Regular updates on our girl’s development from the app, parent-teacher meetings and quick 5-minute chats with teachers after school has been very helpful as it allows us to “continue” the learning with our child at home. Post-Covid, the school began to resume a lot of activities such as farm visits (crocodile, fish, goat, vegetable etc.), excursions (Changi Experience Studio), outdoor activities (Splash @ Kidz Amaze), Sports Day and cultural celebrations to make learning fun and enjoyable at the same time. As parents we also looked forward to taking part in some of these activities with our kids. The curriculum in my opinion is quite well-balanced and focuses on different areas of development. While preparation for Primary 1 is important, the champs also spend substantial time on learning various musical instruments (violin!), arts and crafts, cultural diversity and outdoor activities to stimulate development in other areas and build up their character. Our girl was fortunate to be taught by several wonderful and dedicated teachers who are always looking out for her. The principal Veron, form teachers Mr. Tze and 杨老师 constantly updated us on her meltdowns in school and this helped us greatly in correcting her behavioral issues. Mr. Tze's encouraging and motivating attitude is really ""contagious"" and we could see our girl being influenced positively by him. 柴老师, whom we know so well by now and possibly the active longest-serving teacher there, will personally watch over her whenever she has her bad days and calm her down. Jerome and Katherine have also been proactive in sharing feedback on our girl’s development in music and reading. Our boy who is in Nursery was assigned to the young and vibrant pair of 小恩 and Tiffany who could match his energy levels and we could feel their genuine attachment to the toddlers under them from their dedication and efforts towards the preparation for the Year-End Musical showcase. Location wise, the school may not be conveniently accessible but having its own little gym, library, and outdoor playground more than makes up for it. It can be quite a pain during wet weather as the walkway from the main road bus stop to the school is unsheltered. To sum it up, MC Punggol team really outdone themselves in making the 2 biggest events of the year, the Family Fiesta and the Year-End Musical, a great success. I believe a lot of parents were touched by the performances and proud of their champs. The hours spent on choreographing the dance, rehearsals, handmaking the costumes and props is a testament to the passion and dedication of the whole MC Punggol team under the leadership of Veron. We are really grateful to the teachers who will be departing the school after leading the champs through these milestones in their preschool journey and for the positive impact on them. I would not hesitate to recommend MC Punggol to parents who are looking for a preschool and willing to pay more for the higher education standards and conducive environment. PS: We were impressed by Sheryl's attentiveness to my dad's condition and for taking the initiative to change my parents' seats for the Musical.

"I speak from the experience of being a father of two who are attending Mindchamps Punggol Northshore, and this is my honest opinion of the establishment. Location wise it might not be the most convenient to some, but the environment and infrastructure together with real estate space more than makes up for it. I have been impressed by the general state of cleaniness and hygiene control of the school whenever I visit the place, and the seemingly much lower rates of HFMD/Influenza spreads within the school is probably a good tesitmony of that. While as with every establishment we cannot expect the quality of every single teacher to be of the highest standard of excellence, I have observed that generally most if not all of the staffs have displayed a good level of understanding with regards to how they should effectively carry themselves in various situations. It is clear that training is prioritized on a management level for that to be achieved (think Hai Di Lao, but for schools). A huge plus point is it's not uncommon to see staffs who are truly passionate about what they do and enjoy being surrounded by kids. Annoyance or irritation from the staff is an extremely rare sight if any. I am impressed by how most of the staff make the effort to know every child's name and even attempt to build rapport with each of everyone of them. It's comforting to know that there are multiple staffs and teachers who approach their work with their hearts daily. I do not think this would be possible without the likes of Ms Veron, Mr Jerome and Cai Laoshi (to name a few but there's more), who have definitely helped in creating a healthy culture and environment within the establishment for children to grow and shine in. I dare confidently say that most children who graduate from Mindchamps Punggol Northshore will enjoy a headstart in their primary school journey. Would highly recommend if cost is not a factor, as I'd see it as a foundational investment in our children and their future.",0.31079365079365084,Topic 1,"['teacher', 'school', 'child', 'kid', 'care', 'principal', 'son', 'parent', 'good', 'thank', 'time', 'day', 'centre', 'go', 'year', 'daughter', 'love', 'like', 'month', 'update']",MindChamps PreSchool @ Punggol

"I'm a parent of 2 kids who are currently in this branch for about 4 years and lucky to have found this branch for our kids. The branch has a strong curriculum and always has the kids' well-being as their priority. While there is a strong curriculum in place, they also teach based on the class's interest. This is important to sustain kids' curiosity in learning. For example for N1 classes learning about farm animals, The teachers will hold conversations with the kids and find out their interests. With this, class A would have a slightly different aspect from class B based on their kid's interests. With the opening up from covid situation, they have increased their excursions, such as theatre play, goat farm, crocodile farms as well! The kids enjoyed themselves a lot. The teachers are dedicated and always go above and beyond their primary responsibility. They always provide timely and valuable feedback on your kids and allow parents to know how they are in school, etc. The principal and admin staff are very responsive as well. All in all, I would say that this branch is indeed a flagship branch of mind champ where they have a good curriculum, good systems and processes, good teachers, and admin staff. Do note that not all mind champ branches are the same. After hearing about the experiences that my friends had with other branches. I'm lucky to have found this branch.",0.2946078431372549,Topic 0,"['teacher', 'child', 'school', 'kid', 'love', 'good', 'environment', 'staff', 'learn', 'parent', 'care', 'thank', 'nurture', 'preschool', 'activity', 'ms', 'experience', 'learning', 'great', 'fun']",MindChamps PreSchool @ Punggol

These days, seeing him eagerly and excitedly reach for his teachers to baobao / run into the gate in the morning, beaming widely at pickup everyday and speaking fondly of his friends and teachers in school really puts an anxious mother’s heart at great ease.

With so many choices of pre-school out there I was unsure which is the best for my daughter.

In addition to teaching the basic academic skills, the workshop explained how they build the children’s confidence to face these challenges.

"I'd like to affirm the good work that the teachers and staff have done, especially those mentioned below: Thank you foremost to my son's class teachers - Ms Siying, 李老师, and Ms Huihui. We as parents are well aware that handling a very active and restless child like my son isn't the easiest, but the teachers try their best and are transparent about how they manage and at times discipline him. My special thanks to 李老师 - her updates (through phonecalls and chats during pickup) are always very astute, sharp and insightful. It only goes to show she isn't just child minding - she is thoughtful about the children's behaviour and tries to interpret what they might mean. It means a lot to me that she takes the time to troubleshoot issues with me, and never once comes across as judgemental. This is so important to a parent. 2) Thank you to the enrichment teachers too - Mr Jerome, Ms Lash, and Ms Hanah. My son comes back telling me all sorts of things he's learnt — log rolling in gym class, takadimi rhythm in music class, and spheres (!) in literacy class. It's really funny and heartening at the same time. And he's only 3! 3) And lastly to everyone else - principal Ms Veron, admin staff and the other teachers : thank you for always being welcoming and smiley during drop off (even when us as parents are not! 😂). It makes a difference how kids are welcomed. Thank u Mindchamps Northshore :)",0.17750270562770562,Topic 1,"['teacher', 'school', 'child', 'kid', 'care', 'principal', 'son', 'parent', 'good', 'thank', 'time', 'day', 'centre', 'go', 'year', 'daughter', 'love', 'like', 'month', 'update']",MindChamps PreSchool @ Punggol

Mr Tze is an energetic and passionate teacher. He is creative and always goes above and beyond to ensure the champs enjoy learning! He has been spot on about my sons challenges despite it being very early into the year and we have tremendous trust that he will push our child to his highest potential. Mr Tze relates to parents very well being a father himself and is always reassuring!

"My son has been with Punggol Northshore Mindchamp for more than a year since he was 22 months old. What first made me chose this school is the curriculum of Mindchamp, the good reputation and the school’s cleanliness & environment. I am glad to have sent my boy to Mindchamp punggol because I observed how well-run this place is, passionate teachers and how well-thought lesson plans their have. 1. The teachers truly cares for the students through small little actions that I have observed. They are patience, caring and well-trained. My boy feels very comfortable with them. 2. What impresses me is that all teachers receiving and sending off the kids at the reception remember each and every student names! How attentive it is. 3. The principal, Ms Veron runs the school very well. She is hands-on, decisive, attentive, and approachable. She impresses me with how she handles every covid situation - transparent reporting, clear instruction and personally calling parents to follow-up. With her running the school, it gives me assurance.

"My daughter has been attending Mindchamps Punggol Northshore since she was 2 years old(PG). If you are looking for a school with comprehensive curriculum, this is the school that you can consider. The champs learnt and gained knowledge through enquiry learning, which I think it is a fun way of learning. Their focus is not only on academic wise, they also build the champs' character, self-esteem, emphasising on mannerism. There are always timely updates on latest cases on HFMD/Covid on teacher-parent apps, which is really assuring especially when they ensure deep cleaning is carried out each time.

"孙老师 from Northshore Mindchamps has touched us immensely during the difficult period of constant Covid outbursts in the country. Alongside the principal, she would not only call us to show concern when we are unable to send our child, with low immunity, to school, she would send us comprehensive notes of study and slides of the chinese classes missed to ensure our child is able to catch up with the syllabus. All these efforts spent despite her being heavily pregnant. Our English speaking child now sings Chinese songs, recites Chinese poems and is able to recognise and read Chinese words when back home from school.

"I had a negative experience with MindChamps. I registered, paid a deposit, and two months' fees to secure a promotional rate during registration. I completed all required forms and waited for my daughter's class to begin in less than two months. However, about two to three weeks after registration, I received a call informing me of a fee increase. The staff told me that if I do not agree with the increment, I can choose to withdraw and they will refund fully. But this was not what I was initially told during sign-up. I'm aware that I'm not the only parent affected by this. MindChamps did not honor their promise, and the principal unashamedly mentioned a clause that is ‘allowing them to change terms and conditions without notice’, which left me stunned. Their sales tactic was to lock in a special 12-month fee promotion during the special registration period. I find MindChamps Singapore's actions disappointing and unacceptable. But anyway, thanks to their management, this turned out to be a blessing in disguise for us. I'm extremely relieved that my child is not part of this school. I personally know a few music teachers working at MC. While I understand that personal lives should generally not be intertwined with one's profession as a teacher working there, I can't help but feel a great sense of relief that my child is not being taught or cared for by certain music teachers.",0.034837092731829576,Topic 1,"['teacher', 'school', 'child', 'kid', 'care', 'principal', 'son', 'parent', 'good', 'thank', 'time', 'day', 'centre', 'go', 'year', 'daughter', 'love', 'like', 'month', 'update']",MindChamps PreSchool @ Toa Payoh

"Sending my son to Mindchamps TPY preschool since Nursery. Very big spacious preschool with individual classrooms, activity rooms ,music room, gourmet room etc and mindscape indoor playground and more. My son picked up strong vocal skills and confidence and he writes his alphabets and numbers well even before turning 4. He recognizes simple words when reading. My son is able to wear his uniform ,socks and shoes independently too as he learned these skills in school with constant practice.. I like the fact that there is a good amount of both play and academics in Mindchamps curriculum (which is very important in this era). They have started going on outdoor learning journeys too after the COVID restrictions have been eased. And of course the friendly and caring teachers as well - Form teacher, Chinese Lao Shi and other enrichment teachers !!

"Definitely a great place for your kids to have fun and learn at the same time. Enrolled my child into Mindchamp Buangkok for PG class and we were amazed at the rate she has grown and developed. A safe and comfortable environment where school goes the extra mile to ensure safety for the kids (strict protocols in place for visitors and child friendly fixtures and fittings) and sanitisation being done at common area regularly. Artworks done by the child were displayed around the school to showcase and create inviting environment for the child when they enter school compound. Dedicated and inspiring teachers who spent extra efforts in decorating the classrooms to fit the theme of the lesson plan. Regular update are sent to parents on the development progress of the child with reports and pictures. A good mixture of engaging, fun and systematic curriculums allows the child to get hands on experiences where my child enjoyed very much. Though there are no outdoor area within the school, there is a huge gym area for their lessons and there are also the monthly excursions for the child to explore and relate their classroom learnings to real life experience. The principal and administrative staff are also very accommodating and responsive to the needs of the parents. Besides the class teachers, the school principal also makes effort to speak to parents during drop off and pick up timings to strengthen the school and parents partnership in developing the child. With the positive development on my elder child, my younger child will also commence school at Mindchamp Buangkok shortly. Having seen and heard a lot of stories from my friends enrolling their child at other places, I’m confident to recommend that MC Buangkok is a place where you can enrol your child to with no regrets!",0.22757836990595615,Topic 0,"['teacher', 'child', 'school', 'kid', 'love', 'good', 'environment', 'staff', 'learn', 'parent', 'care', 'thank', 'nurture', 'preschool', 'activity', 'ms', 'experience', 'learning', 'great', 'fun']",MindChamps PreSchool @ Buangkok (Serangoon North)

"Our daughter commenced her journey at Mindchamps Buangkok (""MCBKK"") since N1 way back in early 2019. She participated and we just attended her K2 graduation ceremony 3 weeks back and she will be leaving Mindchamps as a confident and articulate ""K3"" to start her P1 formal education very shortly. During the course of the last 4 years, both my wife and I have much to thank the whole team at MCBKK principle, teachers and support staff. It is inevitable that there will always be turnover for any childcare though I know MCBKK will try their best to retain and replace. Kids are also more resilient than what most parents think and adapt quickly. Nonetheless as I reflect, would I have trusted my daughter with MCBKK all over again? The answer is a definite ""yes' for the following reasons. - Great partnership between parents and entire MCBKK team, bus driver and bus auntie included. - Genuine and professional teachers and staff who really care and bother - Clean, bright and cheerful environment - Holistic educational experience that covers English, Chinese, Math, reading, writing, physical education, art, gourmet, performance and music just to name some. - Honest and timely feedback from teachers - Supportive fellow parents and wonderful classmates Covid was a trying period for all of us and I could appreciate the amount of consideration, stress and work that went behind as the MCBKK team tried to maintain a safe and healthy environment for the kids while keeping up with their programme. Special mention Ms Ng, Ms Yun, Ms Shannon, Ms Mabel, Ms Beth, Ms Amanda, Ms Cass, Ms Fu, Ms Stella and ex-teachers Ms Eileen and Ms Zhang Qian. A big Thank You to all of you! All of you have been instrumental in one way or another for our child's growing up journey. We are always grateful and appreciative and definitely like to share our gratitude and experience with any parents who are currently in their taunting process of selecting a pre-school for their little ones. There is no perfect pre-school but only the most suitable one. For us, we are happy to have partnered MCBKK for our child's journey.

"After months of searching for a preschool for my daughter, I have finally found Mindchamps Buangkok to be our preferred choice in this neighborhood. Likely to be one of the best that offers an all-rounded curriculum and one with personalized feedback . We have seen a significant progression in our daughter's learning journey since she was transferred from another preschool at N1 last year. One example is that my daughter is able to recognise her name and write it independently now. Kudos to the dedicated team that Principal Shannon leads. Their parent-teacher communication is clear and also insightful in understanding our daughter's personal growth, which is helpful to her growth not only in school but also at home. The school also organizes monthly field trips that align with its curriculum, which is fantastic because the kids not only learn within a classroom setting but also experience it in a more practical setting. Special shout out to the teachers, Ms. Kym, Fu laoshi, Ren laoshi, Ms. Cass, and Ms. Beverley & supporting staff for making my daughter, Klary, preschool's journey a fulfilling one.",0.22388392857142858,Topic 0,"['teacher', 'child', 'school', 'kid', 'love', 'good', 'environment', 'staff', 'learn', 'parent', 'care', 'thank', 'nurture', 'preschool', 'activity', 'ms', 'experience', 'learning', 'great', 'fun']",MindChamps PreSchool @ Buangkok (Serangoon North)

"Last year, we visited a few preschools in the midview city area and found Mindchamps to be really impressive. The campus is big and clean. There are a number of facilities within the school: indoor playground, water playground, gym and music class. The centre head Mr Desmond gave a good introduction to the school and he was very patient at answering questions. The curriculum sounded really good so we decided to enrol our son in. We originally planned to let our son start PG in December this year but due to sudden changes in caretaking availability, we urgently needed help. Thankfully the school was able to accommodate us and let our boy in earlier by a month. Thank you to vice principal Ms Alice for helping us with this urgent request. We appreciate this very much. I accompanied my boy for his first 2 days of school and found that the teachers there are really nurturing and dedicated. As my boy has not attended school before, I was initially worried about him adapting to school life. My boy’s class teachers Ms Jocelyn Tan and 郭老师 were very assuring. Following through the class, I could see that they are very caring and engaged with the children really well. They also took time to report on my child’s status and the activities they carried out. I can feel that my son is in safe hands. After one month of school, my son has settled in well. I also noticed my son verbalizing a lot more words and became more independent. For this, I must commend the efforts of the teachers and the school for providing such a nurturing environment.

"Beware the $70 waitlist. It's a great education facility, but if it's a full-house for your kid's level, they may ask you to pay $70 to be added to a waitlist. ** Read this then make up your mind** If it was a waitlist that works like normal waitlists (a vacancy becomes available, next-in-line gets a slot), then great! But I'm aware of people who have managed to cut queue without even joining the waitlist at all. Same level as my kid, same full house they should have encountered. If I didn't know the kid who (unknowingly) cut the queue, I'd still be (foolishly) waiting today. If this school is knowingly taking money and not fulfilling their end of the deal, sounds like a scam to me. If there are loopholes in their system, that's plain incompetence.

"It was very nice to receive our very first termly report on our child's (TL) progress in his first 10 weeks at MindChamps. How time flies. We thought it is only apt that we would like to write this letter to express our gratitude and appreciation for all the wonderful things Ms Arina and 冯老师 have done as preschool teachers. Their passion, dedication, and commitment to shaping the minds and lives of young children is truly admirable, and we are grateful for the positive impact they have had on our little one. From the moment little TL started attending their class, it was clear that they are not just a teacher, but also a caring and nurturing mentor They have a gift for making every child feel valued, heard, and supported, which is so important in building their confidence and self esteem. Their patience, kindness, and enthusiasm have helped our little TL develop a love for learning and a sense of curiosity about the world around him. He would come home singing the songs he learned ""Ee i ee I o.."". We can tell how attached he is towards Ms Arina and 冯老师. They would patiently coax him to nap and have their ways of comforting him. Their creativity and imagination in designing age appropriate activities and lessons have made learning fun and engaging for him. We are constantly amazed by the projects and crafts little TL works on (from the many photos shared by both teachers), and how much he has grown in his cognitive and motor skills. Their abilities to tailor their teaching to each child's unique needs and learning style is truly remarkable, and we are grateful for the individual attention and care they give to him. As parents, we know that we can trust them to provide a safe and nurturing environment for our little one. Their communication and collaboration with us have been invaluable in keeping us informed about little TL's progress and development. We truly appreciate their willingness to listen to our concerns and feedback, and to provide suggestions and work with us in supporting his growth and development. On a special note, we would also like to extend our appreciation to 钱老师 whose presence is always able to calm little TL down at the daily morning reception. Many times, she would be sharp to notice his eyes welling up and will always be able to provide comfort and a change of emotions in him (and probably in us parents too). In short, we would like to thank them for being exceptional preschool teachers. Their impact on our little one's life and education will be felt for years to come, and we are forever grateful for the role they have played in shaping his future. Their hard work and dedication have not gone unnoticed, and we hope they know how much they are appreciated.

"""After four years at Mindchamps J10, my affection for this school has only grown stronger. I adore the close-knit community here..it feels like I’m reliving my own school days. From the sweetest teachers and principals to the wonderful parents, everyone is closely bonded. Last month, our class organized a food donation drive, which deeply touched both me and my daughter. It was incredibly meaningful to be able to help needy families in our community. From packing to sorting to distributing, we all worked together seamlessly. Studying here isn’t just about teachers and students..it feels like a second home.

"We started our firstborn at Mindchamps J10 since Playgroup, and the curriculum has exposed her to opportunities for a holistic growth in the domains of language, cognitive development and socio-emotional skills. The school also provides a conducive environment for learning with its well thought-out and organized classrooms and facilities. She returns home excitedly every day and shares with us the activities and experiences she has gone through in school. Not only has she formed strong friendships with her classmates (us parents have formed great friendships too!), but also developed good rapport with her supportive teachers and even non-teaching staff. Communication between parents and teachers has always been transparent and prompt with the Mindchamps app, as we are constantly updated with our child’s progress and well-being in school. Her increasing independence and curiosity stand as evidence of the effectiveness of Mindchamp’s pedagogical approach and the professionalism of J10’s teaching team. Our secondborn started his school journey in July 2023. At just slightly over 6 months, we have noticed remarkable progress in his language, numeracy, and social interaction skills. With his new found friendships and deep bonds with the teachers, he is ecstatic to go to school every day and is loving and enjoying every moment in school.

As their playground is located out of the mall, We were worried that it might be too noisy.. so we went to check the traffic condition at several timing, and to our surprise, only peak hours about 5.30-6pm there was an increase of traffic. We also like how they communicate effectively with parents in their own school app. I get to see updates like - what time my girl enters school, temperature checking and more. So much thought and effort is put into the educational activities as well. I know my daughter loves being here, and i wouldn't take her anywhere else. We’re so happy with our decision.

"My elder daughter started with MC @J10 since it 1st opened up in 2015. In a flash of an eye, 6yrs had passed and now my younger daughter is going to spend her last year in MC in 2022. I'm happy to see how my girls had developed overall throughout the years they had been in the centre (not just in studies, but even in the soft skills like leadership, adaptability, problem solving and social cohesiveness). We had always found the teachers and directors at MC @J10 to be approachable and genuine in wanting to care for the children under them (maybe we were just blessed that my 2 girls had great teachers). I had observed how improvements were made to the infrastructure over the years. I had seen the outdoor playground get refurbished into a garden area before a new playground was added as well. This makes water play so much more meaningful when we still remember how it originally was. With the addition of the Allied care centre below, I have no doubt that the centre's management is looking towards providing awesome care for a larger spectrum of children (including those who might need additional assistance to integrate better into mainstream education). Kudos to their foresight and planning! Here's to wishing MC @J10 and it's teaching staffs many more fantastic years ahead, creating better futures for our future generations!

"We started our son Isaac at Mindchamps J10 when he was 1.5 years old, just before the Covid pandemic started. He showed great affinity for the school as he was attentive and curious while we were taking a tour of the campus – and since then he has embarked on a thrilling journey with the kindergarten. Mindchamps provides a conducive environment for Isaac to learn and grow over the years – he picked up social skills quickly and displays proficiency in both Mandarin and English (yes he even challenges our vocabulary now!) and it is evident he has a great love for music and reading. We especially appreciate the hard work put in by the teachers and staff at MindChamps J10 during the Covid period when classes were conducted online and regular updates were provided to parents through the Mindchamps app with lots of pictures and curriculum details. And the teachers put in a lot of effort to give us a detailed write up of what Isaac learns every term, not just in English but also in Chinese. We are very glad that we can share photos of what Isaac does in school everyday with his grandparents as well! Now Isaac looks forward to going to school every morning (Not just because of Fun Toast!) but he tells us that he looks forward to seeing his teachers and friends – so much so he wants to stay back after school hours to continue playing with his classmates.

As parents, we are grateful and appreciative of the school and teachers' effort to take in our feedback and work together. Kyler used to have issues with pronunciation and was apprehensive of saying out new words. It was the school and teachers teamwork that helped nurture Kyler into a confident child. He is no longer afraid of pronouncing the word wrongly, and takes it as a challenge and enjoys the fun of learning. Since playgroup until K2, on a weekly basis, kyler has to bring back English and Chinese reading books provided by the school. And everyweek without fail, we would read with him. This has become a reading habit for kyler and us to read and bond together through the book section.

"MindChamps Preschool fully embodies the elements that both my wife and I were looking for when we were looking for a school for Athena. We had a tour within the school compound, and we spoke to the staffs about a possible enrolment which left us hugely impressed with the level of detail and assurance that they have given to us. Without a doubt, we signed up for Athena on the spot. The school environment is very clean, organized, and well-thought out. It provides a conducive learning and safe playing environment for the children. The curriculum not only develops the child in academics, but it enhances their motor, emotional, musical, and social interaction abilities as well. This is truly a holistic way of nurturing our children as they advance through their early childhood. Athena started her journey with MindChamps J10 in January 2021. At just slightly over a year mark, we have noticed remarkable progress in Athena’s language, numeracy, and social interaction skills. From the early days of reaching the school entrance in tears to where we are today, she is loving and enjoying every little moment that she has spent in school. Almost every other day, she would ecstatically return home and explain to us in great length on what she has done for the day. We were also pleasant to find that she has developed a good rapport with her class and several strong friendships within her classmates. It makes her day in school even more fulfilling. Communication between the staffs and parents are transparent and prompt. Through digital means such as the MindChamps App and email, we are constantly being updated with our child’s progress and school matters. The Covid-19 pandemic has been with us for almost a good 2 years. Whilst many schools could not organize group activities or outdoor field-trips due to the pandemic restrictions, MindChamps J10 were able to think out of the box and help to engage the children in different meaningful ways. My wife and I would like to thank MindChamps J10 wholeheartedly for creating such a pleasant environment for Athena to learn and play. We look forward to seeing Athena progressing through her early childhood in MindChamps J10.",0.25497807017543855,Topic 0,"['teacher', 'child', 'school', 'kid', 'love', 'good', 'environment', 'staff', 'learn', 'parent', 'care', 'thank', 'nurture', 'preschool', 'activity', 'ms', 'experience', 'learning', 'great', 'fun']",MindChamps PreSchool @ Junction 10

"Our son, Jesse has come a long way since he joined Mindchamps @ Junction 10 at 18 months young. Being one that is very attached to us, it was a challenge assimilating him into a new environment. It was therefore a huge relief to receive timely updates/pictures from the school reassuring us that he was doing alright. 1.5yrs on, he waits at the door all ready to leave for school, no cries, no struggle. At pickup, he would be his usual cheerful self telling us about his day, what he ate, what he did etc. We really appreciate the attention that has been provided to him by everyone in school, and more importantly see how he has notably gown into someone with confidence and exemplary speech capability.

She would also confidently tell me that she would teach me on the weekend. Make, the most delicious food in the world that I learned to make in school today, etc. These sharings let me know that she has a fulfilling life at school every day, has a group of good friends, and has great teachers, so I can trust my daughter to the school. Of course, occasionally, my daughter will be unhappy at school, and she will tell me what happened, why she was unhappy, the teacher's reaction, etc. Every time I see the teacher handle it very fairly, which makes me feel at ease. K2 The school organized many activities this year to allow children to better connect with kindergarten and primary school, such as visiting Zhenhua Primary School, learning to recognize coins, etc. It allows my daughter and the children in the class to understand what primary school will look like in the future, and also gives them full confidence and expectations for primary school learning. Through various activities in the school, the parents of the classmates also become familiar with each other and become a big family, communicating with each other and growing together.

Thankfully, we gave MindChamps PreSchool @ Yio Chu Kang a chance – and fast forward to today, we are glad to have made that decision.

We are also grateful for 宋老师, who within a short span of time has helped Chloe to improve dramatically in Chinese, especially in terms of handwriting and her careful attention to the Chinese strokes (笔画). We are truly blessed to have another amazing teacher in this school. Finally, it is great leadership that pushes exemplary qualities in the staff and teachers. For this, we have Mr. Dave to thank for he never fails to listen to our feedback and recommendations despite his busy schedule. His enthusiasm and passion towards preschool education can be seen in his ever-consistent search of an all-rounded education for the kids such as organising sports and activities to enrich the children’s experiences and physical and mental developments.

"My elder daughter joined in 2019 N2 level when the school just started operating. She felt at home instantly from the first day. In her 3yrs with Mc Nordcom2, I have never heard from her that she does not want to go to school in the morning. It says a lot about the overall vibe and cheerful environment that is truly unique to this school. She graduated in 2021 and moved on to primary school and I must say that mindchamp nc2 teachers prep their graduates very well for transitioning to primary school (spelling, show n tell, numerical etc). She was awarded all-rounder award at the end of her p1 academic year. My younger boy joined in 2021 PG. I must thank the school and teacher for helping him transition from home to PG smoothly. He took around 2 weeks to get used to morning routine of going to school. Beyond that on most days, he does not struggle going to school. We saw him grew tremendously in term of language skill, motor skill, social skill, music skill etc. We were so thankful that it was his teacher who potty trained him successfully while we as parent were struggling to train him at home. From the very start he joined, the school teachers has kept very open and transparent communications in partnering with us as parents handling the various request and feedback. This is made possible thanks to the support of the school management championed by the centre director, who also happen to be the owner Ms Nicol. Would also like to point out usually if I have any issues or questions to ask, teachers / center director would reply in timely manner.

"I cannot recommend Mindchamps @Upper Thomson enough for parents looking for a more engaging and nurturing environment for their little ones. My daughter enrolled there when she was 18 months old. She was very shy, so teachers must have made a tremendous effort to make my daughter feel safe and secure there very quickly. My daughter has developed many skills and learned so much during her time at school, from eating and sleeping on her own, socializing with her peers, to learning her colors, shapes, and numbers etc in both English and Chinese. The music, dance, and drama lessons at this preschool offer a great introduction for us to discover our daughter's interests and talents. Mr Alim, Ms Misellya and Mr Nas did an amazing job to make these lessons so enjoyable. The school also offers weekly reading program and monthly outing program, which we find very enriching and interesting. What sets this preschool apart, though, is the staff's dedication to each child's individual needs and personalities. The PG class size is so small (teacher to student ratio is 2:6) that teachers take the time to get to know each child and tailor their care and education accordingly. My daughter adores her class teachers- Ms Nor & Lin Laoshi, who are both very passionate and responsive and understand my daughter's needs perfectly.

"We always thought that all pre-schools are the same i.e., how different can it be when all we need is a daycare center where children just eat, sleep, and play?

We observed that the MindChamps curriculum is comprehensive, and our LO has developed a lot since – she speaks a lot more at home and gets more and more articulate by the day – in both English and Chinese. She also particularly enjoys the music, dance, and drama classes, which we are also kept very informed by the frequent newsletters and updates from the teachers. With the weekly reading activities encouraged by the school in partnership with the parents at home, our LO has also cultivated the habit of reading (accompanied) and her love for books. The smaller class size and undivided attention worked well for our LO who thrives in a more intimate environment. More importantly, the teachers are also very professional, friendly, and patient 😊 Special shout-out to her favorite teachers – Zhao Laoshi, Ms Jane, Mr Alim, Mr Naz and Misellya, kudos!",0.20878306878306876,Topic 1,"['teacher', 'school', 'child', 'kid', 'care', 'principal', 'son', 'parent', 'good', 'thank', 'time', 'day', 'centre', 'go', 'year', 'daughter', 'love', 'like', 'month', 'update']",MindChamps Performing Arts PreSchool @ Upper Thomson Road
"Our daughter has been in MindChamps for 8 months (since 18 months old). In these 8 months that have absolutely flown by, we have seen dramatic all-round development in her. Being an only child and grandchild, she has learnt to interact and share with children of her age, and from what we hear from her teachers, display some early leadership skills as well. She particularly enjoys dance and music classes in school, and she looks forward excitedly whenever she has to wear her dance outfit to school. She recently went for her first ever school excursion and had many fond memories of it to share with the family when she came home. It is clear to us that she looks up to and adores her teachers, and enjoys her time in school, as she always smiles when we talk about her teachers and is always pretending to be the teacher at home to her cuddly toys.

"I love the experience I've had with Mindchamps @ Woodlands. We've been with the school for about a year plus and I feel that the teachers and staff have been really thoughtful and loving towards my child. There's no issue with sending him to school and he adapted to the environment really quick. It speaks volumes about their level of care because my baby usually cries a lot with strangers when he was younger. The teachers would also communicate closely with us parents to explore ways in which we can better my child's development and I am glad to know that the teachers do understand my child's temperament, development and habits really well. Thus, this has been reassuring to know that my child is in good hands of professionals who are experienced with dealing children as unique individuals. I also love that the school's academic approach is dynamic, where teachings aren't confined to the classroom. I love how my child is able to communicate what he learned in school to me when I come home from work. More importantly, I do appreciate the occasional drops of photos through the Mindchamps app like the attached photos, where I get exclusive updates of their time in school. I cannot thank the teachers enough for providing a loving and nurturing environment for the children.

"Before choosing MindChamps, I visited other schools for comparison. Ultimately, I chose MindChamps Woodlands for several main reasons: 1:The school's core value is respecting children with zero intimidation. as a mother, this was my top priority. 2:The educational philosophy of the school's 10 core values attracted me. 3:MindChamps Woodlands is directly affiliated with the MindChamps headquarters. 4:The school environment is great, very comfortable, and clean. 5:The transparent curriculum planning and the careful selection of food for children made me feel more assured. Without hesitation, I chose MindChamps Woodlands. after my child started at this kindergarten, I felt reassured (i still rmb i was crying together with my son in the first few days to school.). The school's app updates on child's situations time to time daily. Most importantly, my child enjoys going to school. despite relocating (the new home being about an hour's drive from MindChamps Woodlands), we visited new MindChamps schools with the intent to transfer. However, my child firmly insists on staying at MindChamps Woodlands with their teachers and classmates. i always believe that the child's heart is pure, and I believe their choice follows their innermost preference. although it's tough, both my hubby and I respect our child's choice. This little boy strives not to be late for school every day, waking up between 6:50-7:00 am consistently for over half a year. Whenever I ask about his favorite teacher or subject, he always says, I love all the teachers, and I enjoy all the subjects.' But he especially loves the time spent in MindGym and MindSpace. Witnessing my child's joyful anticipation of going to school every day is the happiest moment when sending him to school. Many friends send their children for English tuition, but I feel at MindChamps, I witnessed my child's gradual transformation, not aiming for the best, but improving every day,day by day,bit by bit. This is what I have seen and been most moved by in my child. The MRW and ReadAlong app at MindChamps make it unnecessary for us, a non-English-speaking family, to provide additional tutoring. Of course, this varies from person to person. However, at this stage, I've seen this in my child, and we allow him to progress at his own pace. Over the years, MindChamps Woodlands and all the teachers have given my child warmth, care, and guidance, nurturing him bit by bit from a small boy into a confident, warm, and sunny big boy. He is graduating K2 this year. Initially, to provide 100% companionship in a warm growing environment for my child, I chose to leave the workforce. Children has to grow in each stage, and as a mother, I believe the nurturing environment and people around them, be it at home or school, are most important. At this moment, I am proud to say my best decision was choosing MindChamps Woodlands.and in primary school, Mindchamps mindspace 's art of learning and continued education on ten value attracted me again. we also signed up for mindspace without hesitation as after school student care center for my child .i believe it will be my another best decision. Sincerely thanks all the teachers for everything ❤️. Your presence makes parents like me feel more secure. And it's because of your silent dedication and guidance that I am even prouder of everything my child has achieved.",0.22992322979165086,Topic 1,"['teacher', 'school', 'child', 'kid', 'care', 'principal', 'son', 'parent', 'good', 'thank', 'time', 'day', 'centre', 'go', 'year', 'daughter', 'love', 'like', 'month', 'update']",MindChamps PreSchool @ Woodlands

"Our daughter has been studying at MindChamps@Woodlands for almost 4.5 years. She enjoys going to school everyday. We are very pleased with the school teachers, facilities and programs. Teachers at MindChamps are professional, caring and dedicated. We appreciate the constant communication with the teachers through app messages, face-to-face meetings, weekly and monthly reports. Up-to-date trainings for the teachers ensure the quality of teaching and learning provided to the students. The classrooms are inviting and conducive for learning. Our daughter enjoys playtime at MindGym and MindScape. The MindScape is a new playground facility that is only available at Woodlands and Toa Payoh branches. The program at MindChamps has allowed my child to build a strong foundation. She is able to vocalise her thoughts and express herself well. Lessons such as the show-and-tell sessions, Creativity and Theatrical Strategies have allowed her to build up her confidence and presentation skills. The Reading and Writing lessons enable her to read and write independently from a young age. She also enjoys her MindChamps Music lessons where she has learnt to play the recorder, violin, keyboard and other musical instruments. During Gourmet Moments, she has learnt about food preparation, nutrition, and different cuisines, and is proud to bring home the dish she has prepared in school. My child has also been instilled moral values such as empathy, kindness and courtesy, and is able to care for others. We are heartened with her growth and development over the past four years and are confident that she will be well-prepared for primary school.",0.17150856389986827,Topic 0,"['teacher', 'child', 'school', 'kid', 'love', 'good', 'environment', 'staff', 'learn', 'parent', 'care', 'thank', 'nurture', 'preschool', 'activity', 'ms', 'experience', 'learning', 'great', 'fun']",MindChamps PreSchool @ Woodlands

"""We have had the pleasure of sending our child to MindChamps @ Brooks II since 1 year ago, and we couldn't be happier with the experience. The teachers at MindChamps are exceptional. Their dedication, patience, and genuine care for each child create a nurturing environment where kids thrive. They not only educate but also foster emotional development and social skills in a way that goes above and beyond our expectations. The curriculum is well-structured and engaging, tailored to meet the needs and interests of every child. We've been amazed at the progress our child has made, not just academically, but also in terms of creativity, independence, and confidence. The facilities are clean, safe, and thoughtfully designed. Communication with the staff is seamless. We've always felt welcome to ask questions, seek updates, or discuss any concerns we might have. The regular progress reports and parent-teacher meetings have been invaluable in understanding our child's development journey. Special events and activities are frequent, and it's evident that the staff put a lot of effort into making each one memorable, be it birthday celebrations, themed dress-up days, field trips, or holiday celebrations. The school's management also went above and beyond to create a touching video montage for my child on his birthday.

"As a parent, I have carefully reviewed all the comments. I must objectively state that this school indeed has many issues, and I do not recommend parents to enroll their children here. Firstly, there has been an excessively high turnover of teachers over the past two years. Except for a few senior staff members, the entire teaching staff leaves every year. Secondly, due to the frequent turnover of teachers, children have a very hard time adapting to the school. This has led parents to lose confidence in the school. In summary, this is not a trustworthy school, and in recent years, the school leadership has turned a blind eye to this. The teachers I have come into contact with who left were all highly professional and dedicated. I believe that if it weren't for the extremely poor working environment, no teacher would want to leave. It is evident that the school leadership is not very friendly to its staff, which has resulted in poor school management.",-0.059915654520917676,Topic 1,"['teacher', 'school', 'child', 'kid', 'care', 'principal', 'son', 'parent', 'good', 'thank', 'time', 'day', 'centre', 'go', 'year', 'daughter', 'love', 'like', 'month', 'update']",MindChamps PreSchool @ The Brooks II

Teachers are rude and don't let my son out. Said we need to wait for the social worker to be there and allow my son to be out. Making my son cry inside when he is ready to be out. What's the Protocol? When we can always pick him up without any social worker. Why is this time needed? There's no answer from the teacher and they keep asking us to wait.

"My boy started with TCC in Dec’20 to do ICCP in 2021. From little to no verbal speech and a very short attention span, in a short period of time he showed vast improvements in receptive language, and he was able to do the given worksheets. The teachers also gave him the appropriate support and encouragement when guiding him with his fine motor ie. penmanship and coloring. They conduct their lesson in a small group setting in K1 which benefits children with special needs (SN) or those who need more assistance in learning progressively. The school is very inclusive for children with SN and the other children in the school are also taught how to help their friends with challenges. No child is excluded from any school activities, performances, field trips or “camping” in school. For example, the teachers choreographed the graduation dance and taught my boy to dance in a way that he could manage, even getting classmates to support him in moving around during the dance. It is an incredible honor for my child to have the opportunity to experience being in a performance. I salute the teachers' spirit of never giving up on any child. Teachers are always open to listening and discussing with us how they can better support our boy. They even go the extra mile to get stickers and books of his interest to motivate and reward him. Aunties were so sweet as well - they would do takeaway fruits or afternoon tea breaks for items that he likes if we need to bring him home earlier. It was such a memorable experience for our boy to do a sleepover in school with his classmate before they graduate. He was even appointed to present the token of appreciation to the GOH during graduation. It is an incredible opportunity for him to be trusted with this responsibility. Under the leadership of Ms Candice, the children care community is like a big family. It is also so heartwarming that all the teachers are involved during the first in-person graduation since 2019.

The teachers at word learning centre are the very best and were paying attention to individual child and correcting them wherever needed!

"The best decision we made when we enrolled our boy, Javen, at TWLC for his preschool education. Teachers were caring, nurturing and truly passionate in what they were doing. Every child was given opportunities to excel and realise his/her own potential. Curriculum was well-rounded, exposing the children to various domains like Science, Art, Music & Dance and Languages. The quarterly learning journeys were not only fun but enriching as well. Teachers were receptive to feedback and had an open communication with parents. We always felt at ease and welcomed to speak with the teachers whenever we had any concerns about Javen. When we moved house and were considering switching Javen out of TWLC so that we did not have to travel back to Woodlands, we faced difficulties in finding another school nearby which could match what TWLC could offer and with reasonable school fees. So we stayed on, despite having to travel further. That is how high the standard at TWLC is - it gives us the assurance that our children are in safe hands. Thanks to TWLC for laying a strong foundation, Javen had no problems transitioning to Primary School. He has consistently been performing well from P1 to P5. It has been five years since he graduated from TWLC, but the teachers and school remain close to our heart.

But throughout the course of a few months, I looked forward to going to school, the kindness of the teachers there had made me realize that there was no one that was going to swallow me whole there (I was actually afraid of the teachers). With some friends that I grew really close to, I believe that I had been properly nurtured to be who I am today. I am not only taught major subjects, but I’m also taught about values. Not just through lessons, but through friendships, experiences that I will never want to replace. I walked, or was carried in as an unknowledgeable, inexperienced and antisocial shy person.

"As a long-established private kindergarten in Singapore, PATS’s brand quality does not need to be elaborated. I chose pats sembawang country club campus mainly because of its following advantages: 1. Have your own outdoor activity area and the teachers do take the children outdoors on non-rainy days: at least 2 hours of outdoor activities a day are the best protection for children’s eyes, so I put outdoor conditions first when choosing a kindergarten. First consideration. As well as the school's own play facilities, the school also shares some facilities with the golf club, such as the swimming pool, and the children have two water days each month. 2. Rich extra-school activities: There are actually plenty of activities for children to learn and play in school, but the school also carefully arranges some out-of-school activities, such as taking the children to the stadium to experience football, playing with excavators, and experiencing Experiencing Chinese opera and so on allows children to learn, feel and experience in happiness. 3. Teacher-student ratio: Compared with the ratio of 1:10 or 1:14 in many government kindergartens, the teacher-student ratio of pats sembawang is smaller. In many classes, two teachers teach 10-12 children. In Doudou class, there may be two teachers. A teacher only takes care of six or seven children, which is undoubtedly a great advantage for taking care of children's emotions and helping them adapt to school life. 4. Teacher quality: From what I have observed in the six months since my daughter entered kindergarten, all the teachers and staff at pats sembawang are friendly, polite, and enthusiastic. Before I chose this school, I took my children to the school gate to see the school. I saw that the teacher carried the children out after school, and they were still very dependent on the teacher when they were separated. When I saw that, I felt that it was a blessing to meet such a teacher. I was very lucky. Later, after my daughter entered the kindergarten, I discovered that we were also lucky, because the teachers here really like the children and are really good to them, so the children will naturally like and rely on them. 5. Convenient pick-up and drop-off: Unlike schools in shopping malls, picking up children here does not require you to worry about lack of parking spaces or being stuck in the grace period when leaving the parking lot (if you do not have a private car, you can also choose the school’s school bus service). 6. Daily communication: Through the school APP, you can see the daily updates of the children at school. Although it is not as large as some teachers who set up groups to share continuously, I prefer this method and I prefer teachers to spend more time. Spend time with your kids instead of focusing on taking photos and videos and sending instant group messages. 7. Food: I have visited many schools. I feel that since I want to send my children to kindergarten, I really have to relax. Because of religious reasons, the school does not provide red meat (pork and beef), so I can only rely on the food at home. Dinner supplement. In addition, we have to give up controlling sugar and snacks. When the children get together, it is really freeing and they are really happy. 😬""",0.24312770562770555,Topic 1,"['teacher', 'school', 'child', 'kid', 'care', 'principal', 'son', 'parent', 'good', 'thank', 'time', 'day', 'centre', 'go', 'year', 'daughter', 'love', 'like', 'month', 'update']",The Schoolhouse by Busy Bees (Sembawang Country Club)

"I just moved my child out of Pats Katong branch to another new childcare in 2022. Massive disappointment of our experiences at Katong branch. My child had been with pats schoolhouse from start, past experiences with Pats Shaer (now defunct) and Pats Sembawang was fantastic with great teachers, principals, and environment where they really care for your kids. In Pats Katong branch, experiences was drastically different. -Messy hair of child when return from school -No dry of child’s hair after water play till end of the day. -Child say food given not enough, still hungry. (Apparently quantity is limited as food delivered from Katong 1 to Katong 2) -Rashes due to not cleaning up well after toilet use and teacher just looking at her outside the toilet, even when child asked for help. -Child progress updates on app by K1 teacher was just for the sake of doing, posting general pictures, no additional comments of child progress. -Whole classroom looking at video from a small monitor??? (see pic) Even smaller than my home monitor screen. Some of the above points, I still can brush it away, as might be 5 year old saying wrong things, lack of preschool teachers, lockdown, branch too big etc  But the final straw is really the poor communication of confirmed covid cases in same class. Thou they mentioned it was as per MOH protocol of 2 days after report then school will announce (I dun understand rational of this). As school did not communicate promptly, eventually is parents communicating between each other then we are aware of the situation. Worse still, entire class gotten HRN from MOH, even thou most kids DID NOT attend school most of that week. By just simply looking at check-in records, school will know exactly whom attended school but I guess admin dun even bother to check and just submit entire list to MOH. Anyway, child is happy in new childcare and instantly we can see the drastic differences in the new childcare, communication, enrolment procedures, hygiene taken when entering school etc..

"""During our relocation to Singapore, one of the most important things for us to get settled was choosing the most ideal school for our then 2.5-year-old daughter. My husband and I did countless hours of research, and I personally visited 13 different schools, and sat down with 13 different principals to understand the learning tools/ structure, and core values of each school. It wasn't until I met Natalie from Pat's Buckley that my husband and I both knew we had found the right school. Natalie was professional, personable, caring, welcoming, and very engaging.  We were also very pleased with the tour provided by Miss Gen at the time. I'm especially pleased that both Natalie and Miss Gen are receptive to parental feedback. It's so easy to see that they are dedicated in the improvement of the school's learning environment. My child’s transition to a new school in a new country was made easier under the guidance of her teachers miss Jae and Liu Laoshi. She participated in a variety of activities and events and enjoyed both her teachers and classmates. Liu Laoshi has a vibrant personality, always smiling and ready to assist.  Miss Jae is extremely caring, kind, and helpful. She is also genuinely concerned about my child’s well-being in school and always takes her time to keep me updated whenever I see her during school pick up and drop off.  My child continued to grow over the years under the patient care and guidance of Miss Jae, Miss Kristie, Guo Laoshi, and Xu Laoshi. It's especially heartwarming to see my child constantly singing and dancing to the songs that she's learnt at school from her music lessons with Miss Eunice. Fast forward a few years, my older child has graduated, and my younger child is now also attending Pat’s and loving school under the care of her teachers Miss Tina and Sun Laoshi. Every day my child is always happy to go to school and full of smiles when I pick her up. As a parent, I feel extremely grateful to be part of an institution where the leadership team and the teachers focus on the well-rounded development of a child. The current Principal Miss Gen’s warm and compassionate demeanor radiates throughout the entire school, creating an environment of kindness and respect. The teachers are equally amazing. They are passionate about teaching and care deeply about the well-being and development of every child. Their creativity and enthusiasm shine through in every activity and lesson. They have a genuine love for their students, and it shows in the way they interact with them. My family loves seeing the high level of care from the teachers, and we are grateful for the new and close friendships we've also created with some of the parents. I cannot thank the staff at Pat’s Schoolhouse Buckley enough for the incredible care, love, and education they have provided for my two kids.  Not only have they learned academic skills, but they have also developed social and emotional skills that will serve well in life. I highly recommend Pat’s Buckley to any parent looking for a safe, nurturing, and high-quality preschool.

"I have very good 2 yrs+ experience at Orange Tree Preschool and it was a pity when I have to relocate and change school this year. My kids love the school, the teachers and their friends. They always look forward to going to school. Ms Hema who is the principal cares a lot for the kids and she can remember all their names. She always smiles warmly to receive the kids and waves goodbye fondly when she sends them home. I think all the parents can really see the passion that she has for this job. And if I have any concerns, I feel comfortable to communicate it with her and she will help to address them. The admins in the school are also very nice and provide me with good support. I remembered when my 3 YO first entered school into Nursery One. She cried for the first week. Ms Hema and 赵老师 were there to hug and console her and then she settled down pretty fast. After one week she was no longer crying. It was really heartwarming that my girl could look towards the principal and her form teacher for comfort. And the fact that she settled down after their hugs mean she trust them as well. 赵老师 was very patient with my girl and also helped my girl to overcome her food chewing problem. I really appreciate the patience and concern that 赵老师 put in. 赵老师 is really a dedicated and responsible teacher. There were a lot of effort that she put in on my girl during her preschool stay to help her learning. My girl always told me at home that she loves 赵老师. Even now when she is in a different preschool, she says she misses 赵老师, Teacher Rachel and her friends. Then my boy also entered PGC and we found another gem teacher 曾老师. She was good to my boy and really care a lot for him. She will give me constant updates about him. Overall I think OrangeTree is a good preschool and their environment is good for the kids. They do 2:3 days of chinese and english respectively and alternate every week. Their enrichment classes and school outings are also affordable. And they have their own swimming pool which not a lot of school have. The kids get to play water activities once in a while. Thanks to all the teachers and staff who had shown your care and concern for my two kids.",0.24165849673202616,Topic 1,"['teacher', 'school', 'child', 'kid', 'care', 'principal', 'son', 'parent', 'good', 'thank', 'time', 'day', 'centre', 'go', 'year', 'daughter', 'love', 'like', 'month', 'update']",The Orange Tree Preschool (Choa Chu Kang)

"Both my kids were in OTP and it has been a wonderful learning experience for the kids. They get a lot of care and attention, and are kept stimulated with fun, creative learning activities and regular outdoor time (there’s a pool in the outdoor area even). The teachers are all approachable and caring. The curriculum is well structured with both English and Chinese languages, which expose my kids into variety of activities that develop all kinds of skills they need. The enrichment classes are at reasonable price, I can tell the improvement since my daughter started her Speech and Drama class about a year ago. She also enjoyed her Arts classes and brought back beautiful art pieces. The communication with the school and teachers is also good. The APP regularly updates the activities of the kids (with photos) which let the parents have the sense of what the kids are playing at school. Announcement are also timely updated through the APP as well. Furthermore, when my kids were absent due to illness, the teachers always call me during their lunch break to check on the kids condition, and they also call to update me whenever there’s minor injuries in school (e.g minor scratches due to kids playing). The principal is supper attentive too, fast response in WhatsApp message, and super accommodating when I request to extend school for another week after the withdrawal process is done. Overall I am very happy with Orange Tree Preschool and I felt lucky to pick this school 3 years ago after comparing a few centres in BP area. Now due to house moving, I have to transfer my kids to other childcares. It’s really a heart pain decision, I can’t find the similar type of school at the same fee range anymore. Lastly, I would like to extend my heartfelt appreciation to Principal Ms Hema for leading a strong team of teachers, for welcoming and cheering the children daily with her sunshine personality, for taking initiatives and for her clear communications to parents.

"Poor environment, teachers mostly are lack of patience due to less man power. 1980s style of communication with hand writing on a so call com-book! Not allow to communicate with teachers directly. All matters need to go through principle, yet principle knows nothing at all. No covered pick up area, children always get all wet if raining. Poor arrangement of sending in children every morning, due to less of communication, every parent wants to talk to teachers which makes the flow of sending children in to stuck! especially during COVID period, 15-20 parents and children in a 2 sq meter area for sometimes 15-20mins, not safe at all. Food is terrible, properly all students sharing 300g meat. Principle is arrogant, always blaming on children own problems. Nothing need be improved from school side. Teachers always change due to limited manpower, no one actually can understand children’s real status. Likely we left this school after 6 months bad experience. Once we confirmed to leave, child sleeves were wet almost everyday. Ask him to go toilet by himself, pants were never been worn properly! Ask principle to let teachers ask kid to drink more water due to ulcer, principle response: “you can choose not to send him in” Not recommend at all. Principle’s Attitude decides teacher’s attitude, which may makes the whole environment horrible.

Both joined when they were in PG) The class conducts structured lessons where my children are introduced to a thematic range of learning concepts from family to traffic to food etc. Mathematical and scientific knowledge are also included in their program through indoor experiments and outdoor exploration, where my 2 kids can pick up relevant skills from there. Teacher-parent communication is also very proactive through messaging & communication book, despite the inconvenience posed during covid period.

"My Child was badly scratched, bruised, and bitten on THREE occasions within SIX MONTHS in this Childcare. The teachers and principal did nothing to prevent bullying from happening in their childcare. They show nonchalant attitude towards all injuries during school hours, brushing it off by saying it is inevitable that such incidents happen. Incident 1: My daughter's face was badly scratched by a boy from the same class. Teacher's excuse: The boy was undergoing mood swing therefore it happen. Incident 2: My daughter's hand was bitten by a girl from the same class. There are visible wounds with bite marks on her hand. Teacher's excuse was that they are just playing and such incidents are inevitable. My daughter said she was pushed and bitten and called for help but her teachers did not stop the girl from biting her. Incident 3: My daughter's face was again badly scratched and bruised with 3 visible wounds. Incident happened between 4pm to 5pm. Teacher again did not call to inform. Their excuse: Since parents is fetching them soon, they do not see the need to call to inform. (I fetch my daughter at 6pm). To the principal Ms Sylvia, if you are reading this: Please establish a clear set of process and conduct for your teachers to follow. It is no coincidence that your childcare had so many cases of child injuries under your management. To all potential parents: Do re-consider enrolling your child into this childcare centre. I am happy to provide evidence and proof for everything I have written above.

"""Placed my child on the school’s ECDA waitlist as well as contacted the school personally. I was informed via email that vacancy priority will go to the children of Temasek Polytechnic’s staff which I fully concurred with, seeing that this school is located in the school‘s premise itself. Was told to fill up a form to be placed on the waitlist which I did, and there were no other exchange of emails. I emailed the school about 6 weeks later in the afternoon just to check roughly how many children are ahead of my boy in the waitlist, so as to have a better sense of whether I should continue waiting or perhaps commit to another school further away. Approximately one hour after sending the email, my husband forwarded to me a message notification stating that my child’s interest in little skool house at TP has been removed by the centre citing no vacancy. Naturally, I was appalled and was wondering what are the odds of this being a mere coincidence? I went back to my email wondering whether I have missed out any emails but nope, nothing was sent to me. I called the school and the principal Ivy answered. She told me it was a mere coincidence and that she herself was the one who amended the ECDA list and removed him. And I was told not to worry, as despite the fact that she personally removed him from the wait list, my child remained on their personal wait list and that once again, priority goes to TP staff but they’ll contact me again if there is any vacancies. This baffles me completely because it’s as good as telling me that HDB has removed us from the ballot list for a BTO house, but not to worry as they have a private list which we are supposedly still on. I told the principal that it was a very simple question. We are all adults here. Even if you can’t answer due to privacy issues, there is no need to be so passive aggressive in your action. Say I buy your story that it was sheer coincidence. Can you tell me roughly where my child is on the waitlist? And as usual, I was reiterated that TP’s staff have priority, that she despite being the principal can’t give me an answer unless she opens another class, that she can’t reveal or say anything. I was disappointed nonetheless and hanged up the phone. After which I received 3 missed calls and an email from an admin stating that she will be on leave the next day and that she will contact me via email the following day. I responded to that email citing that a waitlist only serves to exist purely because there is no vacancy in the school isn’t it? Why remove my child from the waitlist after asking us to fill up a form to join the waitlist and then cite “no vacancy” as your reason for removal. Have all the other kids born in 2021 also been personally removed from your ECDA’s wait list (but still remained on your private wait list then)? Does it even make sense? And not surprisingly, I did not receive any email replies to my question following the staff’s one day leave. With such staffs, poor communication and questionable principal overlooking the school, there is no way I would ever trust my child to be left in their hands. Such passive aggressive action shouldn’t be coming from a preschool principal herself in a setting where I’m supposed to entrust that my child is going to be taught good values and virtues at. I won’t even go so far as to recommend this school to my enemy’s children. Should issues arise down the road, as a parent who am I supposed to turn to? Edited: I finally received an email reply from the school today (7 days later). On the evening of the morning that I posted this review. Sheer coincidence again?

In just three weeks of starting in a new school, my kids have experienced exceptional care and attention to detail from the teachers and admin staff.

Even the admin staff, while primarily focused on admin duties, is also incredibly friendly and display plenty nurturing qualities, easing my children's initial fears of school.

"I am writing to express my strong dissatisfaction with the recent experience I had with your institution, Little Skool House MOE. Approximately six months ago, I initiated the process of scheduling a school visit and enrolling my child in your school through your official website. Unfortunately, my interactions with your staff have left me deeply disappointed. Upon following your institution’s instructions to book a visit through your website, I submitted numerous emails and online appointment requests, but to my dismay, I received no response whatsoever. This lack of communication and engagement with prospective parents is unacceptable and has caused significant frustration. Furthermore, when I made a phone call to your institution to seek clarification and confirmation, I was met with an impatient and discourteous attitude. I was informed in a rather dismissive manner that the school had reached its maximum capacity and was no longer accepting new students. To make matters worse, the staff member I was speaking with abruptly ended the call when I attempted to seek further clarification. While I understand that your school may be in high demand, it is essential to treat all prospective parents with respect and provide them with a response, whether or not enrollment slots are available. Failing to do so is a disservice to parents who are genuinely interested in your school and willing to invest their time and effort in the application process. I urge you to implement measures to improve your response time and communication with prospective parents, regardless of the current enrollment status. Your institution should aim to provide a welcoming and respectful experience for all potential students and their families.""",-0.02949179292929292,Topic 1,"['teacher', 'school', 'child', 'kid', 'care', 'principal', 'son', 'parent', 'good', 'thank', 'time', 'day', 'centre', 'go', 'year', 'daughter', 'love', 'like', 'month', 'update']",The Little Skool-House International Pte Ltd (At-Ministry-of-Education)

"TLH is an outstanding preschool! I highly recommend it. The principal (Mrs. Katherine) is also the founder and owner of the school. This means that she has final say of how to run the school and sees ideas thru to implementation. It is extremely valuable to have consistent leadership. She anchors and ensures that the school is run up to her high standards and principles, and based on sound research of what is best for children. The children are taught to be socially aware, responsible and considerate. These and other good habits are inculcated from day one resulting in the school having a calm and cheerful atmosphere. It’s like a home away from home. The school motto is “help me help myself”. There is a focus on confidence and initiative in the context of community. Mrs. Katherine is the model of a skilled and confident person. What better way to teach confidence than to exemplify it authentically! The teachers she selects are of high quality and quite a few have been at the school for many years. This means it’s a stable environment for the children. My child often tells me how much he loves interacting with his teachers. It is a language-rich environment and I have never heard the teachers speak bad English or Mandarin. This is a mixed age Montessori school. Older children are paired with younger ones and the kids learn social graces within community, not simply in theory. Older ones learn patience, leadership and kindness towards younger ones. Younger ones experience this and have confidence that one day they can in turn be in that role, rather than all children waiting on adults to serve them. All kids learn that they are active, useful and integral parts of their community thru everyday interactions. When I went for the school tour a few years ago, I was really caught off guard by 4 children coming up to me to see if I wanted a drink. They were going to pour water for me and host me! It is a true testimony as to how TLH respects children as individuals, believes in their abilities, and empowers them, to the point that the children were not unduly afraid of me, and saw it as their responsibility to host me, the guest in their school. I had visited 10 schools before deciding on this one and even my 1st runner up school is a far cry from what happened during my tour here. The other schools basically told the children to not disturb the adult talking with the principal and go do their own thing. Whereas at TLH, while no one interrupted the conversation, the children were instead encouraged to step up. They are not treated like a distraction to the “real work” that only adults do, but they are empowered to play key roles in the “real work”. Imagine the feeling of accomplishment and personal value they feel, and how eager they would be to step up and take initiative again! It shows me how the teachers view the children and their abilities, and natural opportunities that can be seized to build the kids up. To me, these are very well trained and intelligent teachers, and I would be safe to partner with them for my child’s learning journey. There is an individualised learning plan for each child. Academic lessons like math and reading are done 1-1. The fast learner does not have to sit in a bored classroom learning what he already knows. The slower learner does not have to feel shame and be discouraged to try their best. The kids abilities are intimately known by teachers because of this 1-1 interaction. There is cooking every week where the children themselves get to cook! One of life's greatest sensorial experience. And they learn counting, fractions, mass and volume, chemical reactions, new vocabulary and all that academic stuff without even realizing it. Montessori schools are meant to be so much more than just Maria Montessori's materials. It is the entire ethos and community life, seeing thru children’s eyes and respecting them as valuable individuals. TLH is a Montessori par excellence.",0.18319175360158965,Topic 0,"['teacher', 'child', 'school', 'kid', 'love', 'good', 'environment', 'staff', 'learn', 'parent', 'care', 'thank', 'nurture', 'preschool', 'activity', 'ms', 'experience', 'learning', 'great', 'fun']",The Little House (Montessori)

"Our girl joined The Little House's playgroup when she was only 1.5 years old. I was ready for a month of transition given the young age, but she adopted very quickly in merely a week. Not only the teachers have a wealth of experiences, they are organized and paid much attention to children's reaction and development. Thanks to that, we could pivot our approach of education in timely manner and it had help our daughter tremendously. The teachers also took initiative and let us know that our daughter had shown signs that she was ready for toilet training. It is fascinating and reassuring that the teachers are attentive to the kids, dare I say more so than the parents given that we are 2 working parents... I found overall the children of The Little House to be confident, well-mannered, gentle and creative. The Montessori approach was instilled not just through the tools, facility, or the program - it lives in their daily interaction with the kids.

With their decades of combined experience, they provide a lot of support and advice around any developmental and behavioural issues that your child may face. Our children love the geography lessons, the science experiments, the weekly cooking, the play-based learning, and the structure they get at school. As parents, we love the wholesome (bilingual) environment, the wonderfully diverse student group, the excellent team of teachers and staff, and the inclusive community, all ably held together and led by the head directress, Mrs. Katherine. I especially appreciate the emphasis on good manners, the practical lessons in independence, the focus on the children’s physical development, and the language support given for non-native Mandarin speakers.

"If you're looking for a Montessori that has the best of everything - the classical Montessori environment and practices, a strong focus on the three Rs, a fun and energetic vibe, and more - The Little House Montessori is IT. What I loved the most was that they place a lot of importance on inculcating social graces and thoughtfulness in the children - saying please and thank you, forming and expressing their opinions politely yet effectively, taking turns, being fair, and so on. Children learn so much more than regular classroom stuff - cleaning their own plates and bowls after lunch, using various tools safely (such as scissors, punch machines, staplers, even the binding machine), cooking (and they share all the recipes with us at the end of the year!). The best part is how confident it makes the kids - all Little House kids I've met have this ""can-do"" attitude about everything. Every week, they conduct Science experiments (and they deal with serious stuff: density, buoyancy, condensation...) and teach Geography (they tell the kids about a new country and what's really special about it). Special mention must be made about Mandarin. My daughter joined TLH mid-year in N2, when we had just moved to Singapore. I was quite apprehensive about her having to deal with learning a new language along with everything else that was so new for her. Imagine my surprise (and relief!) when she soon started crooning in Mandarin! When I ask her who her favourite teacher is, most often she names Mandarin teacher that she names. Just to give an idea of how dedicated they are, during the first phase of the circuit breaker, the Mandarin teacher made detailed videos of writing and pronouncing each of the Chinese characters the kids needed to practise, which were so easy even for someone like me, with no knowledge of the language, to follow. And the teachers are truly so, SO caring. I have personally witnessed how lovingly they handle very young kids who are anxious about leaving their mums to go off alone to school. There have been kids who have screamed and cried for the better part of a term or more, but the teachers would handle the situation with seemingly effortless calm. They're also an inclusive school; there have been kids with special needs, who join in the fun with everyone else, including the year-end concert. I could go on and on. Long story short, though; if you're looking for a great school, Montessori or otherwise, for your 1.5 - 6 year old, you really must pay The Little House Montessori a visit.",0.2878563194052325,Topic 1,"['teacher', 'school', 'child', 'kid', 'care', 'principal', 'son', 'parent', 'good', 'thank', 'time', 'day', 'centre', 'go', 'year', 'daughter', 'love', 'like', 'month', 'update']",The Little House (Montessori)

"This was the first kindergarten I viewed after we moved to sunset area. I stepped in an old fashion glass door and got a warm welcome from Mrs Katherine. She enthusiastically walked me around while introducing how the classes would be carried out etc. We walked to the outdoor area, kids were happily playing in the small garden. There came a little girl, she saw me and came close to me. Before I realised, she poured me a glass of water from their snack station, where I saw a tray with couple of glasses stacking up, a jar of water and bananas neatly laying on top of it. That was it. I cancelled all appointments with other kindergarten and enrolled my boy. My boy was then 4yr8month, he enjoyed going to TLH so much. Every week he told me a new science experiment; a new country with either its language or food; a new role-play with manner; oh yeah, a new goodie he made under the instruction of teachers. I was very impressed. The teachers made it all seemed so effortless, yet meaningful. I remembered those days, parents gathered outside of the glass door where the kids lined up and got checked before going in school. Teachers welcomed kids with the brightest smile and funny talks. Mrs Katherine stood at her most comfy tree pose and chatted with us, we all started our days with lots of joy and laughter. Of course, most importantly, we knew our kids would have a wonderful school day at TLH. How can I not mention the year end concert? It was fascinating. Nothing fancy but full of love and warmth. Teachers and kids designed their own stage, no one needed to wear special clothes or make-up. Kids chose what they most comfortable with and what they want to perform. They gave it their best on the stage. It was a pure joy for parents to see the how much their confidence have grown over a year. 2020, the pandemic hit. Teachers in TLH managed to gather all students single performing clips and created a long video. It was heartfelt. Still it seemed so effortless but meaningful. We strongly recommend The Little House Montessori. It was the best decision to enrol our boy there. Everyday in his primary school life has benefitted greatly from his experience at TLH.

"I would like to extend my thanks to Mrs Katherine Sebastian of the Little House (Montessori) and her team of teachers for having done a good job of bringing up my two little ones, Zhi Rong and Jia Ning. I first chose this school, because, during the student visit, I was struck by the fact that the children were going about their studies, calmly and in an orderly manner, without any teacher screaming or raising their voice. Both kids attended 4 years of kindy and nursery education. I am happy with the academic standards of The Little House (Montessori) as they prepare the child for up to primary 2 level of studies Zhi Rong has been doing well in Primary one and two, in Pei Hwa Presbyterian. I am very appreciative of the close supervision and extra care the teachers took to look after my younger daughter. She was initially difficult and reluctant to learn. However, the teachers took the time to suss her out and managed to patiently coax her to apply herself, resulting in her catching up by the time she graduated from K2. We are confident she will not find primary one a struggle Teachers do give feedback to parents on how their kids are doing, and work hand in hand with parents for the betterment of the children. I especially appreciate the occasional talks given by teachers and Mrs Katherine, on how the school teaches their mathematics and English Language. They even hold small get together talks on “How to get your children to behave the TLH way” (You must attend this one!!) Teacher turnover is low in this school, which helps the children feel they are in a safe and stable environment. I understand the school even sponsors teachers for higher learning! If I had a third child, I would not hesitate to send him or her to this school. The teachers are dedicated, professional, knowledgeable. The principal is serious about educating the children and maintaining standards. More than once, I asked her about expanding her school but she won’t do it if it compromises the standards set.

"The Little House was a home away from home to both my children (now aged 9 and 7, and in the Singapore school system). They spent their preschool years playing and learning in the wonderfully creative and nurturing environment of TLH, created by Katherine and her amazing staff of teachers. From rigorous Mandarin, Math and English, to cooking, dancing, plays, games, unbelievably fun school bus rides and more, TLH played a huge role in their development, instilling confidence, empathy and resilience that will hopefully last them for many years to come. As a University educator myself, I cannot speak more highly of the learning environment at TLH - it is indeed a model that I sometimes wish we had the chance to follow even in tertiary education! I am eternally grateful to TLH for playing such a big role in my children’s early lives, and cannot recommend it highly enough!",0.18897058823529417,Topic 0,"['teacher', 'child', 'school', 'kid', 'love', 'good', 'environment', 'staff', 'learn', 'parent', 'care', 'thank', 'nurture', 'preschool', 'activity', 'ms', 'experience', 'learning', 'great', 'fun']",The Little House (Montessori)
"TLH review A truly special place with heart, soul and an extraordinary crew of teachers! I visited a number of pre-schools while searching for a school for my first born and stopped searching the moment I visited TLH. It’s amazing how organised the school is; everyone seems to know exactly where to go and what to do at any point in time. Mrs Katherine runs a tight (and extremely effective) ship at TLH - clearly a woman on a mission! Things I love about TLH: - I love how the children are treated with respect, allowed to be responsible for themselves and others from a young age. They are encouraged to be individuals with unique personalities, strengths and weaknesses. There is no rote learning in this school; every child gets to play, explore and learn at their own pace. They’re taught to be respectful of mother nature and to be kind and empathic towards the needy. - I love how my kids come home happy every day, with tales of how they’ve enjoyed learning about different countries and cultures from geography class, working with magnets during science class, singing about planets and continents at circle time, baking and cooking on Thursdays and most of all, fun times with their friends at the sandpit during outdoor play. - The birthday celebrations I’ve attended at TLH are some of the most meaningful celebrations I’ve ever been to. Instead of focusing the celebration around singing the obligatory “happy birthday” song and cake cutting, the teachers takes time to talk about the birthday child, from the time the child is in his mother’s womb to his milestones and achievements over the years, and the number of times the child has orbited around the sun. - I love how the annual year-end concert is organised as an intimate affair which prioritises the child’s learning process over the end product. No sleek venues, costly costumes or over-rehearsed performers. Instead, every child get to contribute, from creating the backdrop and props to choosing the item they’d like to perform. My younger child has recently started attending TLH as well, shortly after his 2nd birthday. I’m pleased to see how quickly he has adapted to the new environment and how he has grown in confidence, social and physical awareness since starting school at TLH.",0.29732285258601054,Topic 1,"['teacher', 'school', 'child', 'kid', 'care', 'principal', 'son', 'parent', 'good', 'thank', 'time', 'day', 'centre', 'go', 'year', 'daughter', 'love', 'like', 'month', 'update']",The Little House (Montessori)
"Our daughter has attended two other pre-schools prior to The Little House, so we can confidently say that this place is truly special. It is a tight-knit community of outstandingly committed teachers with very low turnover (a problem at many other pre-schools!) and a lovely multicultural mix of students. We also love the school's premises - an airy main room with open doors and windows to the garden and playground, as well as dedicated areas for various purposes. We did not choose this school specifically for the Montessori method, but after witnessing this unique and extremely effective approach to learning we are convinced that this is one of the best ways to build a strong foundation and guide young children into the world of reading, writing and understanding numbers. Every child receives one-to-one attention and is allowed to learn at his or her individual pace. At this school, learning is made fun which in our opinion is the best gift you could give to your child. As a result, we are extremely confident that our daughter will have no problems whatsoever with the transition to primary school. In fact, her reading, writing and maths skills are above average for her age. Another strength of the school is the Mandarin programme which is conducted by native Chinese teachers. We have been thoroughly impressed with the advanced level of our daughter's Mandarin which she picked up solely at this school. The reason why I am emphasizing all these is not because I am overly concerned with her academic performance (not at this young age anyway), but because I have heard some other parents being worried about whether a pre-school with such strong Montessori philosophy would be a good preparation for local primary school. The answer is absolutely yes! In fact, Singapore needs many more schools like Little House! The curricular activities are rounded off by attention to character development and conveying a strong sense of community and teamwork to the children. Then there are the many wonderful traditions at the school that we have come to cherish over the years - the birthday walk, show & tell, Thursday's cooking class, the yearly Deepavali field trip to Little India (amongst many other regular field trips) and many more. We are fortunate to have discovered Little House, a true gem in the Sunset Way neighbourhood, and are already looking forward to enroll our second child in the 2017 intake.",0.2726052689594356,Topic 0,"['teacher', 'child', 'school', 'kid', 'love', 'good', 'environment', 'staff', 'learn', 'parent', 'care', 'thank', 'nurture', 'preschool', 'activity', 'ms', 'experience', 'learning', 'great', 'fun']",The Little House (Montessori)
"We wish we had found this place sooner! We moved our son to TLH in June 2016 during his K1 year after his previous school shut down and it has been an amazing journey for him and for us as parents since he started here. Despite his difficulty with adapting to change, our son transitioned to TLH with remarkable ease, owed largely due to the creative teaching methods TLH uses. Their teachers put in a lot of effort into tailoring the curriculum to each child's individual learning capability. In under a year, our mostly English and partly Hindi speaking son was conversing fluently enough in Mandarin to defend himself if accused of a misdemeanor! The day is a good mix of dual language teaching and playtime, and the weekly sash races and cooking sessions were quite a highlight for our son. One of the things that makes TLH unique is their headmistress Katherine. Kind, funny and incredibly good at running this school, she has a wonderful way with the children and brings together children, teachers and parents alike to develop a wonderful community atmosphere. We were sorry to leave TLH for the inevitable move to P1. Highly recommended.",0.2993567251461988,Topic 0,"['teacher', 'child', 'school', 'kid', 'love', 'good', 'environment', 'staff', 'learn', 'parent', 'care', 'thank', 'nurture', 'preschool', 'activity', 'ms', 'experience', 'learning', 'great', 'fun']",The Little House (Montessori)
"All my three children went to The Little House (Montessori), and we all love and miss it so much! Years after entering primary school, my children’s best friends are from TLH, and several of the families have become family friends. TLH is a true-blue Montessori school that focuses on all aspects of a child’s development: physical, intellectual, language, emotional and social. Each of my children received the attention they needed in the areas where they needed it. Eg. Child no. 1 had to learn to deal better with setbacks, and not lose her temper. Child no.2 needed speech therapy because she was not correcting her mispronunciations even with extra help. Child no. 3 had to learn to share with peers and take turns graciously. Chinese is an organic part of TLH. My children came home talking about a dessert they had sampled from ""墨西哥"" (Mexico), talking about a science experiment that 马老师 had shown them as well as an obstacle course where they had to 爬过桥 (climb over the bridge). Learning to read was so effortless I did not hear about it, until they started pointing out random words they could recognise on billboards or tv subtitles: “Mummy, that is “来”, that is ""我""!"" All three of my children were able to transition easily into primary school. Academically, they were at or above the standard required for primary one. But more importantly, each child took responsibility for their own learning, and took pride in their work. Even when tired and frustrated, each child took pains to finish their work to the best of their ability. Child no. 1 cried as she struggled to finish her math homework, but she stuck it out, working out each answer without guessing. Child no. 3 whined when he to re-write several words in the dreaded Stellar handwriting workbook, but a simple, ""what would your current teacher/Ms Katherine/Kristine/Mrs Jo say?"", were enough to spur him on. Child no. 2 continues to finish her homework independently, something she had done since P1. Socially and emotionally, each child was able to make the leap from a warm, cosy and loving preschool to the much larger and anonymizing primary school. They were confident in managing all the different tasks: making new friends, choosing and buying food from the canteen, being part of a large class of 30 silently copying information from the white board. My oldest is now in secondary school, and continues to blossom, I’m sure in part due to the 3.5 formative years she spent in TLH where she learnt positive habits of independence/self-help, care for others, responsibility and self-discipline. She is able to whip up a delicious meal for the entire family plus guests, due to the love of cooking she developed in TLH. (The weekly Thursday cooking lessons at TLH are legendary! Parents of multiple children look forward to certain dishes, in particular, the chocolate truffle!) TLH feels like a family. There is very low staff turnover. Many of the teachers taught all three of my children, and my children always look forward to going back for visits. Mrs Katherine Sebastian has created a preschool that combines fun with responsibility, love with discipline, bound together with a lot of warmth and friendship.",0.2067390942390942,Topic 0,"['teacher', 'child', 'school', 'kid', 'love', 'good', 'environment', 'staff', 'learn', 'parent', 'care', 'thank', 'nurture', 'preschool', 'activity', 'ms', 'experience', 'learning', 'great', 'fun']",The Little House (Montessori)
"My Daughter started at TLH when she was 2.5 years old. It was only by pure luck that I found the school (like most foreigners, I left the school application to the very last minute) and managed to secure the last slot. I feel very blessed that my Daughter had many happy years at TLH. At that time she was going through potty training and unlike most children, she was not embarrassed or uncomfortable with having ""accidents"" at school all the time. The Teachers were so fantastic in helping me with her pottty training and not once did they complain or grumble. I don't know any school that could be more caring and patient with my child. The children at TLH are guided to be independent and taught how to use a scissors correctly at a young age. And under supervision, they are taught cooking and the safe way to use a small knife or peeler. My Daughter is now 5 and she constantly helps out with the dinner preparation at home. Thanks to TLH she knows how to use these sharp objects safely and correctly. Each child progresses at their own pace so their is no pressure to keep up with someone else. They are taught such a wide range of subjects such as language, reading, Maths, science, cooking and geography. And all this is done in a fun and relaxed way that is easy for a child to understand. I cannot count the number of times I am pleasantly surprised when my Daughter comes home with knowledge such as being able to name all the continents or telling me all about Pluto, the dwarf planet! My Daughter learnt more Chinese at TLH than she did at an external enrichment centre. And later on when I engaged a private Chinese tutor for her, it was TLH that helped me find her. I find that the Teachers are always accessible and ready to help with any issues that I have. They have a good library of resources that enable me to guide my child at home with her studies. Even when I have questions about non-school related issues such as Behavioural problems, they are always willing to listen and guide me. My Daughter has unfortunately moved on to a good international school a couple of months ago. I didn't have a choice as she was offered a place and both my Husband and I are not locals. Because of the high standards at TLH, her writing, reading and Maths level surpassed that of other children in her class. In fact, she often has to help her classmates with their writing. I'm not sure if it's pure chance or if TLH is selective but I have not met a parent at TLH that I do not like. All the parents are very friendly and supportive, and I have made some very dear friends during my daughters time there. Most importantly, TLH has molded my Daughter into a wonderful person. Through TLH, she has learnt to say please and thank you. She learnt to say excuse me and wait her turn to speak. She learnt that smoking is bad. She learnt to be polite and gracious. These are only a fe of the examples amongst many more. I can spot a TLH child at a party. All the TLH children are polite and wait for their turn to have a slice of cake. TLH children do not poke the birthday party or demand their share. In fact, because she is taught to do so at TLH, my Daughter always serves everyone before she has her slice of cake. To summarise, TLH, as locals would say, ""spoil market only"". TLH is so great that no other school compares to it, not even close. Note: TLH has a fantastic catered lunch too, with healthy yet delicious options and the Teachers were very kind to help me keep track of how much my child ate.",0.22574149659863943,Topic 1,"['teacher', 'school', 'child', 'kid', 'care', 'principal', 'son', 'parent', 'good', 'thank', 'time', 'day', 'centre', 'go', 'year', 'daughter', 'love', 'like', 'month', 'update']",The Little House (Montessori)

"We sent our daughter here for four years and we would unhesitatingly recommend it to any parent looking for a superb, well-balanced environment for their children. The staff are truly well-trained, and genuinely warm and caring. With the Montessori method, the children are given individual attention and learn at their own pace in a fun environment. The method ensures that each concept is firmly grasped before the child moves onto the next topic -- nothing is forced onto the child before he/she is ready. I was impressed with the high standards of Mandarin taught and as far as math, reading and writing are concerned, I have no doubt my child will breeze through most of Primary 1. The children are not coddled; they're encouraged to be curious, to figure things out themselves, and to ask if they have questions. Children are introduced to different countries and cultures. They learn to cook little dishes. They build confidence with their weekly show-and-tells, and the open mic at the year-end concerts. If there are playground arguments, they are taught to express their feelings and resolve issues politely. They do science experiments; I was very pleasantly surprised to have my six-year old talk to me about condensation and evaporation. They're encouraged to go out and play and climb and they're taught it's fine to fall down and get a little sweaty and dirty. We loved the multiculturalism in the school; on one occasion, when the kids were taught how to react when they are unable to catch what someone has said, they role-played the situation in English and Mandarin, and one of the kids covered it in French, which I thought was awesome. The high teacher-to-student ratio ensured that teachers were able to give each child individual attention and form close, nurturing relationships. We also liked their involvement with charities. It gave the kids an opportunity to learn that it is a privilege to be able to help the less fortunate, and gave the parents an opportunity to support those in need. The school will provide a firm foundation for further education but what we think makes it stand out, and what we are most grateful for, is the time spent teaching the children self-confidence, self-control, respect for others and social etiquette. For example, one of the (many) lessons was about how to interrupt a conversation politely, another involved teaching the children how holding the door open is a polite and thoughtful act. The school considers social skills an important part of a child's development, and I have noticed that kids from The Little House Montessori are generally polite, kind, respectful and well-adjusted, while still maintaining their own individual, independent personalities. We cannot thank Katherine and the other teachers at The Little House Montessori enough for what they have done for our child.",0.1729142300194932,Topic 0,"['teacher', 'child', 'school', 'kid', 'love', 'good', 'environment', 'staff', 'learn', 'parent', 'care', 'thank', 'nurture', 'preschool', 'activity', 'ms', 'experience', 'learning', 'great', 'fun']",The Little House (Montessori)

"Both my children have been at The Little House since they were 2.5 years old and it has been the best decision I have ever made as a parent. Ten Things I love about The Little House (Montessori) 1. My kids are ALWAYS excited to go to school, and they are always happy when they come home. 2. My kids have rarely been sick since they started. Compared to being in day-care centres before, I can count on one hand the number of sick days my kids have taken. The space is airy and the children have an outdoors play area. They are allowed to be kids and get dirty, play in grass, in sand, bounce on the trampoline, ride bicycles, play pretend, climb on monkey bars. They don't spend all their time washing hands like in day-care-centres, but are taught proper common sense hygiene. 3. TLH is like an extension of our home. There is a VERY low turnover rate with teachers and so the children feel very safe and secure at school. 4. It is always calm. With 50 -60 kids doing different activities at different times, you would often imagine chaos. But in all the times that I have been at the school, peeked through the glass doors, the school environment has always been very calm and the children are often busying themselves with something. 5. Katherine - the principal of the school leads by example and is personally involved in every child's development. She is the heart of the school and the children and teachers make up the soul. 6. TLH has a wonderful network of parents and alumni. Ex-students are often seen at the school functions and end-of-year concerts. School events are so much fun. 7. Best end-of-year concerts. The first part of the concert is like an open mic event, where kids get to choose with whom they perform with, and what they do. The teachers then help them arrange that. The second part will usually be a play where all props and backdrops are made by the older kids. The last part is always a song where the kids all sing together. This is usually when I start tearing up. The concert is held within the school and lunch is served after. Parents are invited to potluck, so it is really like a huge party for the kids and parents. 8. Cooking is a life skill taught to the children once a week. I run a business teaching people to cook, so this is something that I think is dear to my heart. Younger kids get help in the kitchen, with cutting/slicing. As they get older, they are able to manage the prep more independently. My girls are always excited and proud of themselves when they bring their cooked food home. Even if the food isn't always quite edible, it is a great exercise to get the kids used to. We all have to start somewhere and it is really okay if your biscuits turned out like rocks, or if your sweet and sour dish is more sweet than sour - it's all part of the learning process. All recipes are put on a calendar that the school produces every end of the year. This calendar is customised to have your child's face on the front cover, so it is a great keepsake and gift to grandparents who live overseas. 9. Flexibility. The school is very flexible to accommodating children/parents request. As the school owns the school bus, they are able to be flexible with pick up and drop off requests. Whenever possible, they always try to help parents with playdate drop offs. 10. Method. I think the method that is implemented at the school is extremely well thought through and works. The school is always on top of what each child is doing, and their overall development and progress. Parent Teacher Conferences are held twice a year. If we have any questions, Katherine's door is ALWAYS open for a chat or update. My oldest daughter graduated from The Little House last year and is now in Primary 1. She was able to transition easily because of the self-discipline and independence instilled into her at TLH when it comes to learning. She understands that they is time for work, and time for play. I really recommend TLH as a preschool to be your child's home away from home.",0.1996399824134199,Topic 1,"['teacher', 'school', 'child', 'kid', 'care', 'principal', 'son', 'parent', 'good', 'thank', 'time', 'day', 'centre', 'go', 'year', 'daughter', 'love', 'like', 'month', 'update']",The Little House (Montessori)
"Sent both my kids here. It's a great school that embraces diversity. It's important that our children interact with peers with different needs. Besides preparing the children academically for primary school, TLH also creates space for children to grow in confidence. They teach soft skills explicitly e.g. role-playing appropriate behavior for different settings, and get children to practise them too e.g. washing of plates, looking after the younger children esp on fieldtrips. Both my kids grew in confidence in TLH and enjoys things like real cooking, weekly show and tell, climbing outdoors. This is a true Montessori school. It's also great that the school brings in extra curricular activities like aikido and music so we don't need to send the children for enrichment ourselves.",0.2958333333333334,Topic 0,"['teacher', 'child', 'school', 'kid', 'love', 'good', 'environment', 'staff', 'learn', 'parent', 'care', 'thank', 'nurture', 'preschool', 'activity', 'ms', 'experience', 'learning', 'great', 'fun']",The Little House (Montessori)

"Dear TLH, When we first started@TLH, we only had a three-year old and being returning singaporeans, we heard about TLH through a friend who homeschools her kids (she heard wonderful stories about TLH from a friend).  When Qi first started, you had asked me this, ""Did you notice that when she runs, she tip-toes? "" Your montessori-trained teachers observe keenly!  i was embarrassed that as a mother,  i have no clue that she does that! Having 4 kids allow us the opportunity to experience TLH longer. Our family enjoy especially the annual year-end concert.  It is, in my opinion, a concert like no other school concert - the children come first rather than the performance (yet we were thoroughly entertained and every year,  TLH took the effort to make a different backdrop :)!  ). There are no grand hotels and thousand-dollar tickets, only a community that chipped in to bring what they have to share. It is good that the preparation for the concert lasted for only a couple of weeks; children are not performers and ThankU for keeping them that way. The teachers you hire are of exceptional calibre: their linguistic capability is a quality that we may not get in every community. Little children's absorbent minds hear the language spoken properly and in turn, they articulate the language correctly too. ThankU for being firm to the little ones in a gentle, loving manner; there is no shouting, only reminding them the right way of doing things. This is where I wonder if it's the methodology or the school setting - perhaps TLH can share with interested parents how this can be done at home!

"""Enrolled my 9 months old boy since 2020 with Jenna as the school principal. Infant care to playgroup experience was fine until we noticed he often came home with big mosquito bites mainly due to the school allowing the children to eat outdoors which have higher exposure to mosquitoes. Poor hygiene issues mainly also arise from the fact that they don’t shower the children after outdoor play. They only change clothes after play and the children sleeps sweaty. All the above issues caused ill health to my toddler. We withdrew our boy due to an incident of negligence whereby our boy was allowed to wear socks in the music room and he bumped his head with big bruises on the forehead. Our heart broke, and when we went to pick him up from Superland Outram, it was highlighted to us he have many ulcers at the back of his mouth again. This was the 3rd time our boy caught HFMD from Superland Outram. The doctor we visited suggested us changing the preschool after hearing our story. To conclude, I think the teachers here are fine but the school policies lacked proper supervision and maintenance. Hygiene and safety was a MAJOR reason why we pulled out. We were informed that the new principal is only working on part time basis. Our child’s attendance only met 5 to 7 days out of 25 days as the rest of the days are spent on us taking leave to look after a sick child. We requested for refund of deposit since 1st September 2022 and we have yet heard back from the school since. Post written on 19 October 2022.

Cons: 1.

"Just want to share my experience and raise awareness to whoever considering to send their children to this school. I enrolled my Daughter to this school 2 years ago and within this time span, I moved her to a total of 4 different outlets hoping that they may be better but I was so wrong. To think that sending your children to a private preschool may bring you more value, learning and development for your child, think again for this school as my child was mostly playing all the time and could not even get her basics right. It gets worse. The Montessori is just a gimmick to earn more money for the school. I am not sure if the teachers are even properly trained as I feel they are very unprofessional and clueless, wonder how are they even qualified to be Teachers in the first place? I had even witnessed an incident where officers came down for certain checks, and a few classes were brought elsewhere out of the office to “hide”. Believe they could be unlicensed or had no carts. This was my last straw, to have a school doing such acts and shortchanging my child. Isabelle and Danielle (owner and principal of the school) had always tried comforting me by saying that my child was in good hands, my foot. Just trying to make easy money is what both of them are good at. They are salespeople, the kinds you meet when engaging an ID or buying a secondhand car. All promises are made beforehand, and until you have made your purchase, that’s when your worst nightmare comes. Conclusion, if you want to bring your children here, think twice. For the fees you are paying, I believe there are better schools out there. Even government schools are better in my opinion. Anyone has the same thoughts, feel the strong need to share this to everyone.",0.13831417624521072,Topic 1,"['teacher', 'school', 'child', 'kid', 'care', 'principal', 'son', 'parent', 'good', 'thank', 'time', 'day', 'centre', 'go', 'year', 'daughter', 'love', 'like', 'month', 'update']",Superland Pre-School (Outram)
"Superland was the local neighborhood school, we used to love. We started our baby girl in Outram location and since moved to the Tiong Bahru Community Club location. Our baby girl is now K1 and we have seen the expansion of this once admirable school. The pursuit of profit takes a toll on teachers. Safety standards have been dropped. Our girl came back with a big bruise because the playground was not properly padded. They covered the cement with fake grass, that is it, no padding. This location is super secretive. They do not allow parents to enter and poke around. They don't even have a doorbell. Education standards have also been dropped. Chinese curriculum is low. My girl tells me that she does drawings during Chinese lesson. The English teacher is part time and is balancing her schedule between two schools. We thought that the owner and principal care about the children. Now, I'm not so sure. She is likely to kick our kids out of the school for writing this. She thinks parent is the problem, whenever there is a dispute. However, I felt that parents have the right to know and participate in their child's education.

I could not agree any of these. Below are my responses: 1) Teacher to Student Ratio-It is 10plus to 2 teachers in our N1 class. And in K2 my boy class there is only 10 kids in total. 2)There is an online portal where I am able to communicate anything real time to my boys' teachers and even school admin. they normally respond in one hour. 3)Joey is by far the most responsive teacher I have ever encounter, she works later and replies messages after working hour. 4)I choose this school because of the amazing environment and so far, my boys' class there are no teacher change yet.",0.1829166666666667,Topic 1,"['teacher', 'school', 'child', 'kid', 'care', 'principal', 'son', 'parent', 'good', 'thank', 'time', 'day', 'centre', 'go', 'year', 'daughter', 'love', 'like', 'month', 'update']",Superland Pre-school (Bukit Timah)

What we loved most was the transparency and how they handle HFMD, Covid, Stomach flu etc, they will give parents first hand information and we appreciate that a lot.

"BEST DECISION EVER to enroll our kids into Superland Bukit Timah! The team of teachers are superb, communicative and professional. Regardless of the massive number of competing schools in this area, Superland stands out as the best in terms of a holistic curriculum and price point (Deep Value). The school is super clean, neat and bright which provides our kids with a good environment for their growth and education. Our son was fairly young (18 months) and we were very uncertain about getting him used to the idea of pre school. Thankfully the team at Superland were very attentive to him and was able to settle him down fairly quickly. We get regular updates through an app and are happy to learn about how he is doing for the day, week and month. For parents who are afraid of HFMD or Covid clusters etc., FEAR NOT! Breakouts are contained fairly quickly as the kid is quickly isolated away in a safe area while the parents are informed within minutes to take their child home.

"We moved to this area and for convenience, picked the school nearest to us with an available slot for our then 18 month-old. This was a brave move for me (I'm a teacher myself) as I usually do a ton of research on anything. But when we saw the space and met Joey and Teacher Puteri, we decided that this was the school for us. Now, 6 months on, we're still loving the school. The space is really, really beautiful. The warm tones sit well with me because it doesn't overwhelm the children, but that's just aesthetic, right? The ones who really make a true difference are the teachers. Every morning, we are greeted with Joey's amazing enthusiasm and my daughter went from crying at the door to walking in confidently, in just a matter of weeks. We are kept in constant update on what's going on in school and we can be sure that Joey is ever-present in her communication with us. Just this morning, there was a crazy thunderstorm and when the teacher saw us parking, she ran out with a giant umbrella so that we'd stay dry.

Depending on the route you take, the downside could probably be that it requires a little walking if you were to get to the school by public transport.

"I should start the review by saying I never wanted to share this to selfishly keep the herds from coming in but that’s not fair so here goes! Our beloved preschool closed some months ago and in choosing a new place, I wanted to join a preschool that was communicative and focussed on play! It was also important to me that the principal was proactive and vested and thankfully, we had the pleasure of encountering Joey and her team at the new super land at Bukit Timah. Apart from the impressive premises that comprises an in house chef, multi language programs and a super cute library for the kids, what convinced me was the communication, effort and friendliness of Joey. She knew all the kids in the school, was quick to attend to any needs or questions, and went out of her way to make me and boy feel comfortable about the transition. Throughout the many school disruptions due to covid, Joey and team were proactive in getting home packs done and are always checking in to see how the kids are going. Now that my boy has been there for months, the Teachers have been patient in attending to his needs even the arduous process of potty training and Joey in particular has reached out to ensure everything including the birth of my second child was a smooth one for me and my boy!

The teachers and staff are patient, genuinely caring to the kids and show great empathy to us struggling parents! I've seen so many times, teachers at Superland Bukit Timah going out of their way to help parents. Fetching umbrellas, lugging strollers and once, even helping to change a punctured car tyre!

"Our joined daughter superland BT when she was 18months until we relocated recently. All classrooms are very bright, cozy and clean, international teachers and children. My daughter loves all of the teachers and her classmates very much! Full of nurturing teachers and friendly helpful staff. My daughter took care of me from 18 months to a year and a half. Compared to neighboring gardens, the spacious and bright windows and new facilities were very attractive. Although we live in an area where there are not many Japanese people, there was a 30-minute Japanese class taught by a Japanese teacher every day, and we had them create various events, songs, and productions for each season.

"Our kids have been attending the Superland Pre-school 100AM from its opening in 2019 to the date of this review. It is a Montessori-inspired curriculum (not a full-on Montessori school) and our kids have thoroughly enjoyed the school and really liked their teachers. In addition to immersive Chinese class daily, they also offer Japanese and French classes - our kids really enjoyed both Chinese and Japanese classes!! I feel the curriculum is diverse and fun, lots of hands-on activities and very engaging for the kids while also preparing them well for classroom style education. The teachers have always been so thoughtful and creative, and put in lots of efforts to engage both kids and parents. Even during the last two challenging years of COVID-19, the teachers quickly picked up teaching online and tried their best to show parents kids' progress - nice, fun videos too! A few teachers have changed but usually only at the end of the school year. And as an ex-teacher myself, I know that means the school is a relatively enjoyable working environment so that the teachers were all very considerate when leaving the school; happy teachers = happy kids!! The administration team keeps the parents well informed. One of our favorite thing about the school is its space - it has lots of natural lighting and relatively high ceiling (both rarely found in the CBD area!). Even though has a bit of echo and aircon is quite cold, it feels spacious and has enough space to play. It also has an outdoor field upstairs but due to COVID-19, they have stopped going up -- hopefully it will restart soon!! Another thing that my kids have told me is that they enjoy their meals at school - a small but important thing to note! :) The administration team upkeeps the school very well and communicates with parents regularly - all parents also have direct communication with teachers via an app. We deeply appreciate the wonderful teachers and staff Teacher Abby, Teacher Clarie, Teacher Si, Wang Laoshi, Liu Laoshi, Kaori-sensei and Principal Wahila and Ms. Nisa for supporting our kids through their early education for the past few years!",0.24595601851851848,Topic 1,"['teacher', 'school', 'child', 'kid', 'care', 'principal', 'son', 'parent', 'good', 'thank', 'time', 'day', 'centre', 'go', 'year', 'daughter', 'love', 'like', 'month', 'update']",Superland Pre-School (100 AM) Pte Ltd

"Super Amazing Curriculum. One of its kind in SG where every lesson is a fulfilling enrichment. Student get to be co-creators of knowledge, explorers etc. They conducted scientific experiments and acquire science knowledge in the process, make their own games, learn how to prepare even their own meals (culinary, motor skills, cultivate independence etc), learn a musical instruments including even parts of a ukulele all without extra costs.

Review on Punggol branch My first born Nicole who is now 19 years old in NUS currently was from Sunshine. Surprisingly there are quite a few of her kindergarden ex class friends in VJC during that year. We are quite impress on the early childhood influence. Some things must have done right. My 2nd born Kendric graduated this year 2023 from K2.. overall this is a great neighbourhood school who the management spend great effort . Infant care is a new section so no comments as my son was not from this infant care. He joined in play group and progress along. Teachers overall are fine with some exception ones .. there are ups and down moments especially During covid period. We can see great effort from the principal. The gradulation concert was well planned and great entertaining which leave good memories for all of us.

"I have the most amazing experience to share. My son is diagnosed as 2e (twice exceptional) gifted child with autism + dyslexia. Since infancy, he has problems attending several prestigious childcare centres in town area. He is now in K2, 5 months to Primary 1. I have decided to look for a childcare with a good review of the principal. I told the Principal Ruth truthfully that I need help to integrate him for school readiness, and I am entrusting my son in her hands. TADAH! All my 5 years of worries and struggles are non-existent in this centre! My son fits in readily and happily! REJOICE! It is also our great blessing that his K2 Teacher Maria is special needs trained. For the first time in his life, my son is willing to attend a school outing without me! And wakes up for it! Thank you Principal Ruth, Teacher Maria and Centre Team! If you seek a loving and supportive team, this is where the heart is. BIG THANKS from a very appreciative mum. (first posted 4 months ago) Update My Kayden has graduated! Super thankful to Principal Ruth, Teacher Maria and Fang Laoshi(Chinese language teacher) for putting in so much effort and love to prepare such a good concert!

"I would like to express my deep concerns regarding the quality of education and care at Sunshine Kids Care Centre. My child attended the school for a brief period, and I was extremely disappointed with the level of service provided. One of the most alarming issues I observed was the chronic shortage of teachers. Despite being a well-known neighbourhood preschool, they are continuously understaffed, which results in the children not receiving the appropriate attention they require. I noticed that the turnover rate of teachers was quite high, which further worsened the situation. The lack of continuity in the teaching staff made it difficult for my child to settle in and establish a stable learning routine. Furthermore, the children's turnover rate was also high, which was a cause for concern. The frequent comings and goings of students resulted in a disruptive and unsettling atmosphere for the children. The children require a stable environment to develop their social and learning skills, which the preschool failed to provide. I would advise parents to think twice before enrolling their children at Sunshine Kids Care Centre. The chronic shortage of teachers, high turnover rates, and disruptive atmosphere can have detrimental effects on children's development. I urge the school's management to address these issues promptly to ensure that the children receive the education and care they deserve.",-0.049111111111111105,Topic 0,"['teacher', 'child', 'school', 'kid', 'love', 'good', 'environment', 'staff', 'learn', 'parent', 'care', 'thank', 'nurture', 'preschool', 'activity', 'ms', 'experience', 'learning', 'great', 'fun']",Sunshine Kids Care Centre @ Punggol Pte Ltd

"My 1st born is one of the first few infant that joined the infant care at Punggol when they started the infant care service. She was 3 months plus when she joined and is 18 months now. Through out the 15 months there, we are happy with her development and thankful to Ms. Ruth (Principal) and the teachers there who showered her with care and love. Over the 15 months, there were some minor scratches sustained but nothing serious. And we were always informed of such scratches by Ms Ruth or the teachers. Occasionally, we would notice diaper rashes and would feedback to the teachers/Principal and the teachers there would take extra care to change the diaper more frequently throughout the day. All in all, I think being a neighbourhood childcare and infant care, they had done an excellent job in taking care of my daughter and contributed to her development. The centre also organizes events during festive period and invite the parents to participate which I think it's a good initiative to allow parents to have a glimpse of how the centre culture is like.

The school teachers did not inform me immediately. When my wife and i fetched our baby, we noticed the cut and the teacher lied that it was due to our baby to pull the helmet of other baby. We knew that there are CCTV cameras installed on the center and we asked principal for an explanation. After a long delay, the principal told us that it was likely due to a circular teaching tool which had sharp edges and that the babies were not well seated on chairs and the tool was passed around among the babies. In addition to the cut, we noticed that almost all babies cried when a china teacher carried them. Upon further enquiry with a former teacher, we found out that the teacher scolds the babies everyday and we also saw that she shook an infant violently when the infant cried.

"""To be honest, when we first toured the school we did not like it very much but still decided to give it a chance. Contrary to the tour we had with the prev sch where the teachers tried to engage, smiles and talk to my son, the teachers at Sunflower Preschool did not bother to engage or talk. (This was on a Saturday) The Principal does not seem to know what she was talking about and when asked questions, the answers she gives were uncertain. I think this is where we should have caught the signs and not enroll him. On the first day of school, one of the parents will be allowed to sit in for an hour to let the child adapt. I witness a few things in the school and was straightaway uncomfortable with putting my son in the care of the teachers there. The list are as follows: 1. One of the teacher wearing a mask kissed another infant (Honestly, i can understand if sometimes teachers very sayang the baby then they wanna hug them or cuddle and kiss them. However, there are a lot of germs on the mask.) 2. During shower, the teacher look frustrated when showering my son as he was no familiar with the place and kept crying. ( You can tell from the mannerism) 3. During milk feeding time, the teacher vigorously shakes the bottle while the bottle was in my son’s mouth to make him drink the milk. 4. The school strictly limits milk for my then 11 MONTH OLD son at 1PM & 4PM only. This is actually my dealbreaker. There is not flexibility whatsoever. I have called the principal to discuss this however she was firm and would not give any leeway. Her reason being - they are at the age where they have to train their motor skill (?) Something along the line. I have checked with other schools and there is no such policies or rules in their IFC. 5. I don’t believe the school was honest. In the school app, the school always input that my son finishes his milk. My son always have a problem w drinking his milk and there will alw be leftover. Even in the previous school, he hd an issue with milk intake and the teacher will feedback in the school app accordingly. 6. On his first day of school, HALF DAY. I trusted my son in their care and he came back w a bruise on his face. Usually i would be OK with this kind of injury as they are learning how to walk and are crawling around. But it is the first day of school and he was there for only 3 hours without my supervision. You would think that the teachers will pay more attention to the new infant attending a new school but it does not seem to be the case. I completely understand that accidents can happen but not when it is the first day of school and they are most definitely not short-handed if they are a ratio of 1:3. 7. The school is an air-conditioned facility. After showering they will put the baby in the play area where the FAN is blowing directly at them. 8. My son fall sick 3 times in the less than one month he was there. The first time was runny nose, second and third was back to back stomach flu. He had ongoing runny nose for few weeks. I had to take a lot of AL and CCL due to these. There was no notification from the school of related cases. I believe this is negligence from the school part. 9. The principal is really clueless. The school app does not allow teachers to communicate w the parents directly and only the principal has access to the school communication app. During the first day, when i asked the principal about the access for the school app, she merely said,” er, you should have access w the app cause same as prev school.” She obviously doesnt know what she was talking about. I checked w the admin afterwards. 10. We told the school that we would like to withdraw our son on the third day. However, we have to serve a month notice else our deposit will be forfeited. He cried everyday he attended school. It was heartbreaking. In view of the above reasons, if they dared behave like this infront of the parent. I wonder how they are like behind closed curtains.

"My 13months old child has been in this IFC since 3 months old. What I like about the center is the very low turnover rate. Since my child started school, the core team of full time teachers has not changed at all except for one who had to leave due to medical reason. This helps with establishing consistent routines for my child such as nap routines. And I think having low turnover helps in building relationship with my child, allowing her to feel safe and secure with the familiar adults. This is very evident every morning at drop offs when she is happy to go school, she baobao the teacher spontaneously. In terms of communication with parents, they used an app but it's to update on the day activities (without picture) of the child (e.g. nap start and end time, milk feed volume, diaper change time). Then every two weeks, the P would send a one page file, usually with two pictures, of what my child has done for the two weeks. In short, dont expect a lot of photo updates. I'm actually very happy with this arrangement because it means the teachers' phone usage time is very low. They can really focus on the children. Anyway they update me every time at pick up and drop off so I think that's good enough for me. Overall, the P and teachers are very assuring and always work collaboratively with us. Once in a while, the teachers will advise me to work on certain skills which I found really helpful. — Add on: With regards to feeding, based on my little one’s experience in the school (but please check in with school), before they go on solids, the milk schedule is individualised. We have to key in the app the last feed we gave to our baby before sending to school so that they know what time to give the next feed. In fact there was once I forgot to key and teacher had to call me. Then when my little one is able to sit well on a chair (usually around 7months), they will be given oats at 10am (replace a milk feed) - you can either choose to eat the one given by school or you provide. Then when she was promoted to mobile side, usually around 10-11months when they can stand, the oats was replaced with porridge and there is also a tea break (most of the time are fruits) at about 3pm. After one year old, there’s also breakfast at 8am. I find the teachers really understanding because they tried replacing the 8am milk feed with the breakfast provided but my girl kept crying despite consuming a lot of the breakfast. They updated me at pick up on the same day and told me most likely she couldn’t adapt to the change (for breakfast only, she was ok with the rest of the solids at other timings that were introduced much earlier) and suggested to continue to give her a little milk in school and then they will give her a reduced portion of breakfast after that.

"had to say something after seeing a 1-star review of the IFC, which our daughter is in since when she was only 2+months. She has been with the IFC for 10+ months now. Overall, we are very pleased to have found this rare gem at such a price point. WHY? 1. the IFC has its own dedicated space and does not cluster-congregate with PG, N1 & N2. There was a sofa within for teachers to 'rest' and feed the babies. 2. the teachers, mostly mandarin speaking, really care of the babies. will there be accidents? yes, my daughter hit her head a couple of times, but hey, try taking care of 3 babies concurrently. what I appreciate is that the teachers were transparent and share during dismissal without sweeping under the carpet. 3. the principal often pops over and will personally cover any shortfall in manpower / MC. Have seen her doing so a few times. because afterall, everyone knows taking care of babies are not easy because they are more vulnerable. 4. There is regular teacher-parents meet with parents. This tickled us previously because honestly, what is there to update for babies? and also, they already updated us weekly and also biweekly over the app. The principal works on Sunday and send parents the biweekly update on Sunday. if this isn't dedication, I don't know what is. 5. when our baby girl had eczema, the IFC teachers were very willing to help with the cream application because they were truly concerned. They also spent the effort to 'troubleshoot' with us initially on what might be the cause, changing bath lotion and body cream. 6. when my baby was transiting to solids, I was very worried because she had a couple of episodes vomiting in her sleep midnight. The Principal and IFC teachers worked hand-in-glove with us to help tide through this phase, sharing in full details of their meals / ingredients and even calling me personally to address my worries. Did I ever think of pulling my baby out and changing centres? Being a first time parent, yes, I did. Because she kept falling sick every 2 ~ 3 weeks initially. but after reading some parents' forum, I realised it is the rite of passage for all babies/children, even for IFCs which charge $2+K per month. Further, babies do develop awareness over time. It is traumatic for babies to change schools and change carers. Hence, I dropped the idea completely. Glad I did. and yes, I do recommend this IFC as long as it is the same Principal and the same IFC teachers. :)",0.11378648233486943,Topic 1,"['teacher', 'school', 'child', 'kid', 'care', 'principal', 'son', 'parent', 'good', 'thank', 'time', 'day', 'centre', 'go', 'year', 'daughter', 'love', 'like', 'month', 'update']",Sunflower Preschool @ Teck Ghee Pte Ltd
"Had to share my experience after seeing the 1 star review & feels that somehow things doesn't add up here. Sent my first child there since he was 4 months old & 2nd child also managed to enroll in the school, both receive lots of love & affection from all teachers. Communication has always been a breeze with the school teachers & principle, in the initial phase when the app wasn't available yet & also now, with the usage of the app. They will usually give an informal short update when we pick the kids up as well. The team has always been very transparent with the kids activities, be it good or bad. This gives us the confidence that they are actually bother about the wellbeing & growth of our kids. Feed scheduling: I left this to the experts as they are trying to establish a feed routine for the kids & in the long term it will make life easier for everyone, parents included, since the kids will want to feed at a fixed timing, making it easier to plan around them. Injuries: refer to top.. Very transparent about all incidents thus far. They will call us if it is too serious but hey whats growing up without a few bumps & bruises? With regards to the kids falling sick while in school, it is a known fact that this will happen no matter which pre-school they are sent to. Probably the only way to skip this is to bubble wrap them in a clean room environment, i guess. No issue with the communication over the app or what so ever. They have a hotline & whatsapp number for emergency contact, in case you need them for whatever reasons. Curtians.... Hmm, given the location of the school beside a common walkway from a busstop, I can understand why curtains are needed. Certian level of privacy should be given to the occupants of the school, be it the teachers or the kids.

"When we were expecting our first child, we were not sure whether we would hire a nanny or enroll to an infant care. Not convinced by the first option, we visited over twenty infant cares before coming accross Sunflower Baby House. We liked that it was a good size school, not too big, not too small, with kids from different background and nationalities. Ms Angela and her caring team made us feel reassured and confident about the school before joining and since Day 1 after we did. We’ve never looked back and love how the team had always been so loving with our children. Being foreigners, we had no family support and having our kids at Sunflower enabled us to juggle between work and the family with the peace of the mind. The school feels like a little family thanks to its great caring team and the parents we became friends with. The teachers always took the time to engage and discuss with us, whenever we had any question or concern, they would always address them. Aside from that, what stood out is the Chinese level. It is very impressive compared to other schools that claim to be “bilingual”. Our kids loved learning Chinese thanks to the laoshi they had who have been at Sunflower for decades. All in all, for families looking for a nurturing environment for their child(ren), please consider Sunflower baby house on your list and have a look!

"We chose Sunflower for our older boy (now P3) when he was 9 months old primarily because there used to be a branch less than 5 minutes' drive from our place. When that branch had to close we were too lazy to find a new childcare centre so we moved to the (original) Grandstand branch. Our younger one followed when he was 3.5 months. We don't have a helper and my husband and I both work FT, so finding an infantcare centre we could trust was important. I didn't feel the need in the past 8 years to be overly concerned about how they were doing in infantcare, then PG, nursery and kindergarten; they were always happy, thriving, and well taken care of physically and emotionally by the teachers. They enjoyed a range of enrichment activities provided by the centre, and - this is important - were adequately prepared through Sunflower's Chinese programme for SAP school life. Notwithstanding there being no 听写 (that I knew of anyway, lol). We didn't send either of them for Chinese enrichment or tuition before P1 and have managed to hold out pretty well to now, we'll see how P3 goes. The boys enjoyed their time with Sunflower, and we were very blessed to have met some wonderful parents and children as well. As with all things, your experience and perception may vary from mine, but I think there's generally no real need to be too uptight about nursery/kindergarten life. Our children, like us before them, will grow up and become their own persons in spite of whatever their parents do or don't do. Sunflower was good for parents like us because we really didn't have to bother much about how the boys were doing - they did well.

"My daughter will be graduating from star learners @ upper bukit timah this week. My heartfelt thanks to the principal Ms Wendy, Teacher Lixin, Ma Lao shi and shan shan Lao shi. They have made such a positive impression throughout the past 4 years and one month. We especially like the school curriculum as my daughter learned not only through book but also through experiment and play. That's why my daughter enjoy every single day in school and in fact she look forward to return to school after holiday. The most amazing thing is early this year, my daughter came home asking me about the Ukraine war!. Only then I realize my daughter also learn about the world news and she actually learned and display empathy to the kids in Ukraine. We are glad that she wanted us to do donation and see what we can help the kids in Ukraine. At the same time, I manage to teach her about the importance of army in Singapore Enrolling her in upper bukit timah branch is the best decision that we have made. Throughout the past 4 years, the teacher turnover rate is low which is good for student. If I remember correct, teacher lixin has been with us for for the past 3 years. Whenever I fetch my daughter, I can see that every teachers is genuinely caring towards all kids. The action from the teachers can be seen and felt. Besides that if the teacher turnover rate is low, that mean the principal and the work environment should be great too. When teachers are happy, they will produce happy students. To summarize, star learners @ upper bukit timah deserve the five stars !",0.19414013405948888,Topic 1,"['teacher', 'school', 'child', 'kid', 'care', 'principal', 'son', 'parent', 'good', 'thank', 'time', 'day', 'centre', 'go', 'year', 'daughter', 'love', 'like', 'month', 'update']",Star Learners @ Upper Bukit Timah | Preschool & Childcare
"We are very lucky to enroll our child in Star Learner at Upper Bukit Timah. The Principal and teachers are professional, with so much heart and caring mindset. They are very responsive to parents' needs and will do their best to meet our expectations. This school provides relatively good quality of toys and books for children. They also have their own playground facilities, children don't have to go to public playground to play. There are also many fun activites in school which help children to learn faster and better. Role play, drama, story telling etc...make learning so much more interesting ! In K2 , children will learn more about Maths, writing words and short sentences in English and Chinese. All these helps in preparation for Primary 1. My child loves going to school, everyday she would come home and tell me what she does in school and how she much she loves the fun activites. Very grateful to these amazing staff especially the Principal, she is very thoughtful, kind, helpful and easy to talk to. Whenever we need help, she is always there.

My son attended Star Learners @ Telok Kurau for 8 months and during that time, he formed strong bonds with his teachers and classmates. The teachers at the center are truly exceptional - they are warm, caring, and always went above and beyond to ensure that my son felt comfortable and supported.

My son was exposed to a range of activities and experiences that helped him develop his cognitive, motor, and social skills. The facilities are also top-notch. The center is bright, clean, and filled with age-appropriate toys and materials. The outdoor play area is also great - my son loved running around and playing with his friends in the fresh air. Finally, I appreciated the open communication between the staff and parents. The teachers were always available to answer my questions and provide updates on my son's progress.

"Terrible 'school'. It was apparent to us in our short time there that the centre is a business and not a school that cares for children. The school principal Ms V was unprofessional and seemed disinterested in the well-being of the children. Shady and avoidant responses were frequently given. She constantly dismiss our concerns. The facilities are dirty and not well-maintained. Children's feet are black during pick up and the shoes area stink. There were several sickness outbreak incidents that were not handled promptly. We caught HFMD AND covid within our first month there. Let alone other viruses. School staff pushes the blame to viruses in our home environment. The communication from the school was poor. I was never informed of any important events or issues let alone daily updates regarding my child. The list goes on... After asking around, we learned from other families that they do not particularly know why they still remain in the school and their children didn't thrive in this centre. See shocking text messages circulating in the community below. School principal Ms V does not seem to care. While I can appreciate each individual teacher and helper at the school, the staff as a whole seemed overwhelmed and unable to provide sufficient support to the children. I worried about the quality of care provided to my child on a daily basis. It was an exhausting period for us and I would not recommend this child care center to any parent. We are now happy in a new centre for over a year and can say that in comparison, Star Learners @ Telok Kurau falls far short of adequate.

"I would like to compliment all the teachers and staffs in Star Learners @ Sengkang Sports Centre on their wonderful teaching skills and all care they gave to the children. All the contribution from them lead to the wonderful improvement in my children's performance during the years. Principal Mrs Diana always keeps a very positive direction for the school which provided educational and interesting activities for both parents and children. The activities were not only simple interesting but also very meaningful. Children visited the Singapore Health Board to learn how to have a healthy habit in their daily life, they went to the Peranakan Museum to explore different culture and they went to Air Base Museum to have hands on experience to the airplanes.  The school also organised many parents-child activities. For example, the Father’s Day celebration were held always in a form of sports competition and activities. It was not only making the father and children closer, but also reminds the importance of health. For Mother’s Day, centre also organised very meaningful talks for mothers and grandmothers, such as “How important is regular gynaecological check-up”. The activities were not only help to widen children’s knowledge, but also show great care to the parents. The teachers in the school are very knowledgeable and responsible to all the children, for both academic results and their daily life. My daugher is a quiet girl and always shy to speak out. With Teacher Nasreen and Xiao Lao Shi’s teach and help, she is now much more confident than previous. She got great improvement in academic performance in English, Math and Chinese. She has also acquired deep interest in the above subjects with teachers’ encouragement. My son is always too active and sometime naughty. However, with the care from Yu Lao Shi and Teacher Liza, he learnt how to behave himself well and how to be a polite and nice boy. Both also received care from all the teachers and staffs in the centre. Aunty Yati helps to provide a clean environment to them and Aunty Toh always prepares healthy and delicious food for them. As working parents, we can leave children with Star Learners without any worry. My girl is graduating this year, and the brother will have another 2 years with Star Learners.

We would like to highlight their strength and give thanks to teachers of N2 for the effort that they have put forth this year. Teacher Liza ============= This year we manage to see Teacher Liza on a more prominent role as the N2 English teacher. As parents we are very happy on how she manages the class. She is firm when needed, as N2 class is more discipline and in order when going on excursion and also gentle when students needed her. As our daughter easily get bored and learn fast on certain situation, Teacher Liza will at times teach her some new songs and also learn basic math calculation while waiting for the kids' turn to go to the toilet, making learning fun by using elements around the environment. From my understanding it is not part of the curriculum at the point of time, and we are much appreciated that Teacher Liza have taken the initiative to do so, to keep our daughter engaging and make learning fun for her. our daugther will always come home waiting to learn to count more stuff and even teach us parents new songs. At time Teacher Liza has try to follow up on how daugther is doing at home to understand our daugther character more in dept. We truely appreciate her effort and care for our daughter. Yu Liaoshi =========== Last year we were really impressed with Yu Liaoshi. And this year is no different. We truly appreciate Yu Liaoshi patient for teaching our daughter Chinese. Our daugther will come home excited to tell us all the beautiful Chinese words to practise and dance. Coming from a non-chinnese speaking family, at times it is very hard to follow up with our daugther's Chinese language. Yu Liaoshi have been very helpful explaining to us parents on what our daugther have learn in school and also show us books during previous PTC on our daugther favourite Chinese book in class and share abit about the book story. As parents we love to follow up with our daugther after school and Yu Liaoshi have gone her way to write down the han-yu pi-yin on the home activities for Syafiqah, making it possible for us to do so. We truely appreciate that she have gone out of her way to assist us and be very patient on teaching our daughter. N2 Teachers ============ For the past 2 years, our daughter had to deal with teacher from her class leaving the school. And at times we are worried for our daughter development as she could get very attached to a teacher one day and suddenly her favourite teacher leaving the other day. We are very happy that Teacher Liza and Yu Liaoshi have been around for the whole of this year to guide our daugther development. Both of them are excellence teachers and work in sync with each other. Making our experience with the school engaging, interactive and worry free as we know our daugther is in good hands. As parents we would love to see both Teacher Liza and Yu Liaoshi be guiding our daugther through K1, as some of her friends (Best friends included) will be leaving school for MOE kindergarten next year. And having both Teacher Liza and Yu Liaoshi will really help our daugther go true these hard times. School Development =================== This year we saw much of the school rebranding and we parents really welcome and appreciate the school effort to make things easy for us parents and teachers. There were bugs in the school app in the beginning, which was expected for any new software. At times bugs like not receiving app notification, not receiving invoices and etc happen and the school principle and teachers have been very helpful in relaying information to parents, to bridge in the gap. We are happy that the app has made things easy and more secure for parents to view school activities photos, invoices, e-consent, buying of uniform and much much more.",0.25043943576552263,Topic 1,"['teacher', 'school', 'child', 'kid', 'care', 'principal', 'son', 'parent', 'good', 'thank', 'time', 'day', 'centre', 'go', 'year', 'daughter', 'love', 'like', 'month', 'update']",Star Learners @ Sengkang Sports Centre | Preschool & Childcare
"My girl has been with the centre since 2015 and graduating this year. My boy is now in PG. Teachers came and left, and each one of them had always left a deep impression on my children, especially Nayli, who is graduating this year. The smiles that the teachers put on every morning, greeting the children when they are dropped at school, makes it so welcoming for the children. To us parents, who might always look like we are in a rush to drop them off so that we can run off to work, seeing the smiles and the cheery ""Good morning!"" or ""Zhao an!"" never fails to uplift my mood for the start of the day. The staff were truly accommodating, especially in ensuring that Zuhaily is being managed better in the school, which at times will mean that Nayli has to be taken out of her class to reassure Zuhaily that everything will be alright. The staff have always been prompt in updating the goods and bads that happened in the centre albeit I cannot deny the fact that my heart jumps everytime I receive a call from the centre. However, deep down inside I know that the teachers are trying their best to do as much as they can. The occasional video updates given to me. It just reassures me that I made the right choice enrolling my kids into Star Learners. Zuhaily had a new English teacher this year, Ms Gill. Her addition to the centre was a nice complement to the centre as well. Zuhaily comes back and will excitedly share the things that he did in school, and most importantly, he remembers what has been done. He will make it a point to get us to read the personalised Children's Day card that Ms Gill has written for him. The occasional updates written about Zuhaily in the comm book is also much appreciated. Thank you Ms Gill! The teachers adore Zuhaily so much and I am so thankful that he is given so much love. What heartens me the most is when Nayli took so much time and effort to write a personalised message for each of the teachers on her cards for Teachers' Day. That is just a reflection of how much of an impression the teachers have left on her, does not matter whethere they are in direct contact with her or not. And enrolling Ms Siti into her Kids' Club? That sounds very exclusive. The Chinese teachers, namely Xiao LaoShi, Yu LaoShi, Zhang LaoShi and Meng LaoShi have been doing such a good job in teaching Mandarin in a fun way, given that Mandarin is not our Mother Tongue. Occasionally, Zuhaily will break into Mandarin at home when we are playing or reading. It has also been useful for both Nayli and Zuhaily to engage with our elderly neighbour who only communicates in Mandarin. Ms Nasreen has done such a wonderful job in preparing Nayli for Primary 1. It is highly engaging and teaching them and preparing them for the real life cum next year. I appreciate the time when she was trying to educate Nayli the importance of being humble. Thankiew Ms Gan for loving Zuhaily so much. He will always remember his pet name, Ali Baba. :) Thankiew Ms Siti for being such a comfort to Zuhaily, knowing that you are someone whom he can turn to when he feels insecure in school. In fact, you have such a warm personality that both my children can attest to that. Ms Zilla is also a teacher who makes effort to make things fun for the children, and i feel that she can totally let loose just to ensure that the children listen and enjoy their learning. Thankiew Ms Liza for teaching fun dance moves to the children during the special events in school. And Mrs Diana, thank you for always being attentive to the needs of the parents and the children, and as a principal of the centre, i am truly impressed that you take time to connect with the children and remembers all their names as well! :) I have never regretted my decision to put my children in Star Learners @ North East.",0.24300384359908175,Topic 1,"['teacher', 'school', 'child', 'kid', 'care', 'principal', 'son', 'parent', 'good', 'thank', 'time', 'day', 'centre', 'go', 'year', 'daughter', 'love', 'like', 'month', 'update']",Star Learners @ Sengkang Sports Centre | Preschool & Childcare
"My Daughter had switched from another childcare centre to Starlearners@SK Sports Centre in January 2018 as N2. And for my Son had started schooling as N1 this year January 2019. We have no regrets to place both of our kids in Starlearners Sports Centre branch, because we can see their growth! Most importantly, they love their teachers Ms Sitti, Ms Zhang, Ms Zila, Ms Meng and Teacher Assistant Ms Gan very much! I can tell that they love the Principal, Aunty Toh and Aunty Yati too, because whenever my kids talk about them, they are always so happy! Under the tremendous care and concern given by the School's Staffs, we as parents, are absolutely very happy to see our children are well-taken care of and they enjoy going to the school. ==================================== Beginning of this year 2019, I am very worried about my Daughter's phonics because alot of my surrounding friends sent their kids for external Phonics class. I didn't send my girl to any external enrichment class, as I do not want to stress my kid. So, I had called up Ms Sitti to have a talk with her & get her advices. With her assurance, I had told my hubby to give our daughter some time. And at home, I will try to recap her phonics and what she had learnt from school. Sometimes, my girl will tell me,"" Ms Sitti said this is a magic word!""  I guess she is learning Phonics well in a fun way. Indeed, we had seen progression in our Daughter's phonics along the way. Many thanks to Ms Sitti's way of teaching Phonics to her. As for my Son's 2nd day of school, he cried badly when I walked away and hide myself during his naptime. Ms Zhang is very patient in handling him and manage to coax him to sleep. He kept crying and do not want to school in Jan and Feb. However, Ms Meng Or Ms Zhang will always help to calm him down. Slowly, my boy had started to adapt himself and love going to school. Apart from that, his communication in English had improved too..Thank u, Ms Zila for teaching him English! At times, our Son do catch my hubby and me in surprise, when he speaks English. =) All these efforts are really worth complimenting for... ==================================== Lastly, I must take this chance to thank the Principal Mrs Diana! She is a very passionate and dedicated Principal! Take for recent case about the long overdue referral fee that I had brought up to her. It was supposed to be my friend's child Centre Principal's job to settle it, but Mrs Diana made an attempt to followup closely and reminded that Centre Principal about it. I really appreciate her effort for making the extra miles. Cheers to Mrs Diana's great mentorship, Passionate Teachers and Caring Support Staffs, who make me totally feel no regrets in placing both of my kids there! =) Thank u for all the love to my children! ❤",0.22134589947089947,Topic 1,"['teacher', 'school', 'child', 'kid', 'care', 'principal', 'son', 'parent', 'good', 'thank', 'time', 'day', 'centre', 'go', 'year', 'daughter', 'love', 'like', 'month', 'update']",Star Learners @ Sengkang Sports Centre | Preschool & Childcare

"My child is in N1. The teacher dont provide any updates about my child in school. Enrolled in 1 Mar 2022. Other than first week of school the form teacher Fina provide update on my child progress, after that totally no updates from the teacher on how is my child coping/behaving in school. No monthly updates or quarter review from the school about child performance. Checked with my friends from other schools, their school/teacher provide monthly updates to the parent on the child performance. Whenever we ask the form teacher on how is my daughter doing in school, she’ll just say oh she’s adapting well, just a general remark from the teacher. Since May, my daughter is toilet trained and weaned of diapers at home other than nap/night time. When we inform the teacher about it, they say we have to work hand in hand. But end up, the school didn’t assist her with toilet training. When ask the form teacher on training, she got defensive and said “as I told you the other time, we have to work hand in hand.” Back then already informed her my girl is potty trained but the form teacher/school is not assisting on this. I can send my girl in at 10am and pick her up at 5pm, 6 diapers were used and this is a common sight. Form teacher didn’t bother to inform us of any extra curriculum activity that is happening in school. There isn’t any on boarding or introduction when we enroll our kid in. For example, the school have their own app. The form teacher said will have a walkthrough with us and briefly explain to us on the app. We asked her several times on the app, she just say y’all explore it on your own. We weren’t aware that if the school have any announcement or notice will be communicated to parent via the app. It’s only after the teacher said we didn’t provide our consent for a certain activity that is happening in school, then we are aware that, oh any formal communication is shared via the app. Withdrawing my child at the end of July 2022, because of the N1 form teacher attitude, constantly emphasizing as I mentioned to you before bla bla bla... The school informed that school fees were not deducted from CDA account. I filled in the giro application form during the enrollment, but apparently the form wasn’t submitted, not sure where the form went or it got leaked out. As no deduction were made nor did the bank contact me with regards to the giro arrangement. The Chinese teacher were very nice and treat my daughter well, as my daughter mentioned that the lao Shi will coax her to sleep, and play with her. But the turnover rate for the Chinese teachers is quite high. From Mar to July, in the span of 4 months, 3 teachers left and joined the class.

"I sent my son to Star Learner's childcare center based on a friend's referral when he was just 18 months old, and it turned out to be the best decision I ever made. We relocated to the Bedok area when he was nearing the end of K1, and we transferred him to Star Learner's at Bedok. I am delighted to share that my son had a fantastic experience at Star Learner's at Yio Chu Kang, and he was warmly welcomed by the new principal, teachers, friends, and the caring staff at Star Learner's at Bedok. One of the aspects that impressed me about Star Learner's is their approach to teaching. They have a monthly theme that is incorporated into the main books and accompanying materials. Through these themed activities, the children explore and grasp important concepts. Additionally, Star Learner's emphasizes discipline and instills the values of courage, integrity, and grit in preschoolers. It's not just about academics; the children also learn valuable social skills and the importance of giving back and being responsible citizens. I cannot speak highly enough of the teachers at Star Learner's. They are dedicated and passionate about their work, and their commitment to the children's well-being is evident. The principal, lunch staff, and cleaning staff are all courteous and show genuine care for the kids. It's clear that they have a customer-centric attitude, making the experience even more pleasant for both parents and children. The highlight of the year for K2 graduates is the Graduation concert, which showcases the children's growth and achievements. It's a wonderful celebration that creates lasting memories for the children and their families. In conclusion, I wholeheartedly recommend Star Learner's at Bedok to any parents who genuinely care about their children's future. The center provides a nurturing and stimulating environment where children not only excel academically but also develop important life skills. My son's time at Star Learner's has been nothing short of exceptional, and I am grateful for the care and dedication shown by the entire team.",0.3076246334310851,Topic 0,"['teacher', 'child', 'school', 'kid', 'love', 'good', 'environment', 'staff', 'learn', 'parent', 'care', 'thank', 'nurture', 'preschool', 'activity', 'ms', 'experience', 'learning', 'great', 'fun']",Star Learners @ Bedok Pte Ltd

They need a healthy heart and mind to grow up. This is the first time I witness such a indifferent childcare centre and it's scary to imagine how a young child would be negatively affected seeing how some adults there behave and how rules are being enforced there. To give u some examples of their way of managing the centre:no visitors other than parents allowed(not even for a young kid who needs much adjustment to the new environment. Even parents, the director Sharon told me strictly 3visits per week allowed), cold attitudes towards visitors including grand parents, young sister of the child and caregivers. All parents and caregivers, when you hear your child crying for help in such a centre by behaving strangely at home after school, who could you ask for help from?

Our child has developed strong bonds with their teachers, who go above and beyond to make them feel safe, loved, and excited to come to school every day. The curriculum is outstanding. It strikes a perfect balance between structured learning and play-based activities. Our little one has thrived in this environment, acquiring essential skills while having a ton of fun. We have witnessed tremendous growth in their cognitive, social, and emotional development during their time at the preschool.

And the teachers can really keep their moods up all the way! Thank you so much! Now my younger boy is in Small Wonder now. He has delayed development condition, so when he enter schoo, he couldnt walk very stable yet... And also he is still not able converse yet, but the principal, Miss Karen and his teachers have been very patient with him. They accept who he is and also treat him the same like others. I can feel that every bit of nuturing heart the teachers Celeste and Li xin 老师 put in. And also every morning, he will always looking forward to go to school. The kids are always greeted by very lively teachers. The school is very big and food served are good. They recently also have an award for their food.

"Love this centre at first sight -The HUGE indoor playground, the conducive environment, and the BIG space for the kids to grow and spend their full day makes me soooo excited when I first visited the centre in 2015. We decided to move 3 of our kids from a childcare centre right below our blk to Small Wonder @ SN as we know that they will love going to school and be as excited as me if they were to see this exciting place. From the curriculum to the daily healthy menu plus the indoor playground which is as big as a HDB 5-room flat (Yes, I'm not kidding!), what more can we ask for when we are looking for a full day centre for our little kiddos? When HFMD was rising in numbers, the school made a firm decision to stop all parents from entering the centre and adopted drop-off at entrance. This has caused much inconvenience to the school as they are highly shorthanded and teachers are supposed to be in the class with their students. I applaud them to go the extra mile just to ensure that the HFMD numbers are controlled to create that safe environment for the kiddos. When I had my #4, I know straight away where to send her to. The infant teachers gave us daily updates via a booklet on meals, diaper change, nap and activities of my baby - and even allow me to breastfeed my baby as and when I need (during non-covid days). Every morning when I send my 8 months old baby in, the assurance the teachers gave me allows me to stay focus on my work. A few dedicated teachers along the way has tear with us when we face some problems with the kids and walk through the changes with us. I can still remember how Karen (current centre principal) walks through with me when I am emotionally shaken with my twin boy who cannot stay focus in class. They never give up on any child and Karen spent a good few hours talking and listening to me while I pour my concern to her. Another incident was during the first few days of school, my eldest was still not familiar with the new faces and was crying before entering school. Shortly after I reached office (still thinking if she can cope), Karen whatsapp me with photos of my child playing happily with her friends in class. I am actually taken by surprise when I received the whatsapp pic as I'm not expecting any school to give real time updates to parents as they have too many kids to look after. Of course after seeing that photo, I can focus more @ work. Teachers who don't teaches our kids takes the effort to remember our kids by their names which makes the kids comfortable when they enter the school every morning. During Circuit Breaker Days, most of our friends' childcare has no HBL and kids are just given random worksheets to work on for the 2 months. But in SW, the teachers did up the HBL curriculum to engage the kids within a very short time frame. From reading to singing and experimental crafts, we were amazed on how fast they get to turnaround this whole episode to engage the kids. Not to mention that there was even a courier arranged to deliver some books to the kids as part of the engagement. This allows the kids to stay engaged with their teachers and peers, and has no fear on returning back to school when school reopens. My eldest had graduated in SW in 2018 - but each time when she fetches the younger siblings with us, the teachers still hug and call out to her and Children's day present was given to her through her younger siblings every year without fail. My twins will be graduating this year (2020). Afterwhich, I will have my youngest who will be graduating in 2022. All in all, we had spent a good 5 years with Small Wonder @ SN and still counting on. Generally, my kids love school and now says 'bye mummy' to me every morning. Small Wonder had taken away my biggest worry on daycare for my kids and this is exactly what we need as parents. We are glad that we had found this school and met all the dedicated teachers and principal along the way. When my youngest graduate in 2022, we are definitely going to miss this childcare.",0.14193581418581416,Topic 1,"['teacher', 'school', 'child', 'kid', 'care', 'principal', 'son', 'parent', 'good', 'thank', 'time', 'day', 'centre', 'go', 'year', 'daughter', 'love', 'like', 'month', 'update']",Small Wonder Preschool (Serangoon)
"My child has been enrolled in this branch for almost 2 years since infant and now he is nearing end of N1. The teachers I had encountered with are patient, caring and committed. Every morning, I see different class teachers and their Admin doing temperature taking, checking for hfmd and sanitization. It seem like the teachers are rotated to the duties. Some teachers could even remember my son, despite not teaching him before. (maybe my son was to naughty?) Whenever there is sickness out break, the senior teacher or principal would send email updating us on the condition till the outbreak ended. My child normally arrived at 7.30am, he will be gathered in a room with the other early arrivals. I will see 1 or 2 teachers taking care of them. My son enjoy that moment as he got to interact with his buddy. At around 8am, his form teacher will fetch him n classmates to class. Via their little lives platform, I could see my son weekly activities like painting, exploring snails, reading, presenting his toy, story telling etc etc.... This gives me some knowledge of what he had learnt in school. He could even share with me or sing the songs. Recently they implemented student card for parents to fetch their child/children . Without the card, they will not release the child. One child has 2 student card. Despite this is a good implementation, but I think the card can be easily duplicated at home. Maybe having barcode or QR code to identify the child will be better? There was a period of time, when my son was constantly misbehaving and restless, his class teacher (yang Laoshi) called me to check on him. She gave me some suggestions on handling him at home and it works. After a period of time, she would follow up and feedback if there is any improvement. I appreciate her commitment and helpfulness. Comparing with my friends children's teacher from other school, they never experienced as such. I told the teacher to try ensuring my son drinks at least 2 bottle of water a day. They did it by judging from the empty water bottle and my son health. If he didn't drink enough, he will start to cough and his dry lip. However there are times where the teacher couldn't, she would honestly inform me when I fetch him. I appreciate her integrity. To be honest, I felt exhausted just taking care of 1 child and the teachers are taking care of about 15 children per class so how can I blame them for overlooking such trival matter. To me, their principal, Karen is experienced and clear on the objectives of children learning. When I spoke to her on an incident of my son, she could analyze the situation by bringing me to see the full picture and giving me suggestions on what they can commit to avoid the incidents. She is confident in her words that convinced me. I am particular in leader behaviors and attitude where Karen had shown the positive side. I believe a good leader will develop good soldiers. Needn't to say, her suggestion works. My overall experience with the school has been positive. Their way of teaching suit my son well. After all this is a pre-school, I would not expect my son to be sitting on the chair listening and doing homework all day (9hrs?) It will be fun when they learn thru play, presenting their favorite toys to friends etc.. It develop their confidence thru interest. I will recommend friends to this school and it's team. 👍",0.17715367965367967,Topic 1,"['teacher', 'school', 'child', 'kid', 'care', 'principal', 'son', 'parent', 'good', 'thank', 'time', 'day', 'centre', 'go', 'year', 'daughter', 'love', 'like', 'month', 'update']",Small Wonder Preschool (Serangoon)

"Pros: New Cons: Lacking in innovation and un-inclusive; When asked about why parent circulars are only in Mandarin without English translations, the Principal Karen mentioned that that’s how they do it in Learning Vision.

Poor staff allocation; the main teacher only comes in at 8.30am, and the second teacher at 9.30am.

"""I am compelled to share my concerns about Skool4kidz Fernvale Campus, particularly regarding their inconsistent rules and practices in comparison to other campuses. There are notable disparities in rules and practices compared to other campuses like Yishun and Punggol, which allow parents to celebrate birthdays with their children in class. Unfortunately, Fernvale's management lacks consideration for children's well-being by excluding parents from birthday celebrations. This exclusion extends beyond birthdays, as the management seems narrow-minded regarding events and new student inclusion. A recent example was a carnival planned for December 9th, where new students were initially overlooked until I raised the issue. The last-minute RSVP demand by 5 the day of notification is impractical for working parents, showcasing a disregard for their schedules. Moreover, the school's lack of support for breastfeeding mothers is questionable and contradicts government encouragement. Conflicting information about a separate fridge designated for breast milk and medicine storage adds to the confusion. The staff's refusal to assist with one feeding per day due to resource constraints raises concerns and contradicts both government recommendations and the child's well-being. Additionally, misinformation during orientation, lack of timely updates, and administrative inefficiencies, including a staff causing inconvenience with uniform promotions, contribute to an overall unpleasant experience. The campus administration's dismissive attitude towards feedback further adds to the frustration. Overall, my experience with Fernvale Campus has been marked by disappointment and a lack of consideration for the well-being of both students and parents. I hope these issues can be addressed for the benefit of all involved in terms of the school's communication, inclusivity, and support for parents and their children's well-being.",-0.09327094474153297,Topic 2,"['tevie', 'increase', 'campus', 'cross', 'block', 'way', 'fee', 'ellie', 'dog', 'wild', 'lack', 'area', 'tool', 'post', 'ppl', 'walk', 'differently', 'outdoors', 'etonhouse', 'dangerous']",Skool4Kidz Campus @ Fernvale

"""Nice teachers and principal they have a great set up. However, it’s not recommended for children who are not Mandarin speaking . My friends child was in Nursery/playgroup and because the class was small so instead of having a English speaking main teacher and a mandarin speaking teacher for mandarin classes as the school originally communicated when signing up , the school had engaged the mandarin teacher to be the main teacher who could not speak a word of English(not even good morning)and this was not communicated to the parents . Unfortunately the parents only noticed this 3-6months in when the child started to show signs of fright to speak because the poor child felt no one understands him in school. The child is now in another school with an English main teacher and the child’s progression in speaking has since improved very well with additional help from enrichment classes to help over come the fear to speak. I believe other upper classes with more students have English main teachers and should have a balance curriculum with both English and mandarin speaking teachers. Just be sure to reiterate the main teachers English speaking when enrolling the child to be able to communicate with your child, as this may cause the child trauma especially at a very young age when they feel no one understands them in school. I hope the school takes this feedback constructive and starts to be transparent on their communication, please be conscious of children in different ethnicities as parents leave their hearts in your trusted hands.",0.14679012345679013,Topic 1,"['teacher', 'school', 'child', 'kid', 'care', 'principal', 'son', 'parent', 'good', 'thank', 'time', 'day', 'centre', 'go', 'year', 'daughter', 'love', 'like', 'month', 'update']",SDM-Moriah Preschool (Greenwich) Pte Ltd

"My son started attending riverlife kindergarten school at 2 years old as pre nursery to n1 and we can really see the big progress. My son have become active from shy type, For a 2 year old he can easily get distracted on the environment but the teachers have patience to teach, he was able to read words which we we didn’t teach as we are busy parents. From there you can really see that the teachers are focusing on every students, not like simply teach and the rest will be on your kid. Teachers really engage the students to be active and to participate on any activities. They teach good values. One of the things that i like most are the videos/ small clips they share weekly for example cooking, reading words, writing letter, drawing, playing as a group/team and so on. These clips really help parents to get an idea on what their kids are up to, I was happy when i saw my son dancing on the videos as he don't usually do at home. As a parent you feel proud and shocked that they can do this. Hope they maintain sending those clips. Principal and teachers are really hands-on as you will notice how they interact with the parents after school. You will see them asking how are things? They even memorize all the names of all the students going in and out. They will also give small feedback / observation to your son to help you understand your kid more. At the end of the term there would be a video call to give the feedback on your kid, The positive feedback and the things to improve on, which is very good. The curriculum on this school is really advance, its like they are two level up on their current level but with no pressure off-course. I have said advance, as due to unfortunate things i needed to move house and move my son to nearby school. Now my son is settled on his new school as n2 and to my surprise, whatever they are teaching here are already been covered in pre nursery of riverlife.

"Rainbow Cove at Alexandra is truly a haven for little ones! Our experience with their infant and child care services has been absolutely exceptional. Both Maevis and Davis have thrived under the loving care of the dedicated staff at Rainbow Cove. Maevis, our eldest, began attending when she was 7 months old, while Davis joined at 2 months old. From the moment we enrolled them, we were impressed by the warmth and professionalism of the team. The children responded with smiles and giggles, and the teachers even went the extra mile to ensure we received pictures of their joyful moments. The caregivers at Rainbow Cove are not just professionals; they are genuine caregivers who create a nurturing and safe environment for the children. Their genuine care is evident in their dedication to each child's well-being and development. One notable example is when Maevis was diagnosed with erb's palsy on her left arm at just 8 months old. I requested the teachers to perform rehabilitation exercises with her, and within a month, Maevis showed significant improvement. its clear to me that the teachers put in the effort for Maevis. Moreover, the facility itself is well-designed and equipped with everything necessary for a child's growth and exploration. The colorful and stimulating environment fosters creativity and learning. Maevis particularly enjoyed riding the trike and playing with friends in the outdoor area. Rainbow Cove is more than just a childcare center; it's a community that values the unique needs of each child. We are immensely grateful to the fantastic team at Rainbow Cove for providing an enriching and loving environment for Maevis and Davis.

"Our baby boy started at Rainbow Cove when he was five and a half months. I worked out a transition plan with the Principal, Ms. Jay, to have his start slowly (in the end of January, before Covid)- only a couple hours a day for three days after Chinese New Year. During those days, I saw that the teachers were all very professional and, above all, they were very passionate. I could clearly witness that taking care of those babies was much more than just a job. After the second day, my new mom jitters were gone. Our baby boy always has a big smile on his face when he gets to school. It has been more than half a year now (with confinement in between) and I feel that I can’t say enough good things about our experience with Rainbow Cove. We are very thankful to all staff. As I said, every teacher, including the principal, is extremely patient, loving and caring. Our son even has a special connection with the auntie who cooks the food and always greets him with an enthusiastic “high five”. Every day children do lots of interesting activities to activate the children’s minds and body. This happened even when we had the lockdown in April/ May. There were online lessons and we were sent activities that children could complete at home. In addition, we are sent pictures and videos via WhatsApp of our babies almost daily. I truly appreciate the time invested in taking those pictures and videos because they make my day at work. Having such close communication with the teachers makes us feel more involved and at ease, reassuring us that our boy is happy, and he is learning new skills with his little friends. At the end of the day when we go and pick our baby, we always get verbal updates too. We also have the daily handwritten personalized booklet to let us know how our son’s day went. Last but not least, Rainbow Cove is very clean and safe. We feel very fortunate to have our son in such environment!

I can truly feel that they really care for my child, and it is more than just a job to them. My child really enjoys going to school and looks forward to seeing his teachers and friends every day, and that’s really saying a lot about how good a job they have done.
