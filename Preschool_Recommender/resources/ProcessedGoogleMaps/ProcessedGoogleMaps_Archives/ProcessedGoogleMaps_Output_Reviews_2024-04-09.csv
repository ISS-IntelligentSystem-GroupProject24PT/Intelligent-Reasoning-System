Agape Little Uni Thomson Centre,"My baby girl joined the centre when she was around 1yo, because my Indonesian helper injured her hand and we needed the extra help. I'm really grateful for all the help and love Agape provided for her and the family. They extended their help in applying for additional subsidy due to low income, with frequent updates on the progress and how my child was doing. The infant care was also well structured and my child grew smarter in her time there. I felt really supported in this time of difficulty. Agape was the nearest centre available to join on short notice without a waitlist of 2+ months, probably due to price, but it's really worth it.",0.1318181818181818,,help,Educational Resources and Materials

Agape Little Uni @ Cecil Pte Ltd,Decided to withdraw my baby after his first day as we decided he was incompatible with the teachers (bad crying even though it was just 2.5hrs in the school) but was still charged the full month amount with no room for negotiations to prorate the amount as I could not give the 14 day notice required in the contract. Just goes to show how much compassion the management actually has.

Ace @ Work Childcare Pte Ltd (Cashew Heights)," When we first moved to Dairy Farm two years ago, we were looking for a kindergarten for our son. The nearby kindergartens were either full or not satisfactory to me. Later I found this low-key kindergarten (it was in an apartment complex, and there was very little information about this kindergarten on the Internet at the time). My son has been in this kindergarten for two years. Facts have proved that choosing this kindergarten is very wise. The kindergarten is located in an apartment with a beautiful environment, isolated from the noise and pollution of the main highway. There are many windows, which can keep the air flowing well, and parents can also watch the children attending classes and playing outside the window. The teachers are very, very friendly.

With help from the Teachers and their reading program, she made tremendous improvements by term 3 in K2. She even knows hanyu pinyin better than me!

The ctr is running at full capacity and at times I'm not sure if the teachers are able to cope or stretching at their max. First - My daughter 's bum constantly red from rash - most likely from delayed diaper change and no, she don't have delicates sensitive skin. Second - she's constantly having runs and I could see intact corns and brown rice in her waste. Ctr continued to feed her such items even after I expressed concern over the suitability as she's only 8 mth old. Even a fellow mummy said the same thing about her infant son, who's also at the Centre. During pick up, at times we will glance at her through the viewing glass. She will be sitting down and stoning. No evening activities or toys to engage her. Alot more issues which I will not go into details. We pulled her out of the Centre as their in charge are not keen to further engage us, but I would like to give thank to their admin support staff ms Joyce - she's super nice and helpful.

My Little Gems Private Limited," Thank you My Little Gems for bringing out the best in our 3 little gems. My children have fond memories of their preschool days at MLG. I asked them what they missed most from preschool and my eldest says he missed the gross motor sessions where they could do fun outdoor activities safely within the temple compound, the youngest one loved the food and says she missed eating the yummy vegetarian curry which is not spicy at all. My 2nd boy’s love for nature blossomed, he still has a keen interest in all things about animals and plants, which started when he was in K1. He remembers Teacher Ye Qin taught them about these topics, and also had the opportunity to experience nature up close when they did their little exploratory visits to the open space behind the school compound, and tended to their little garden space at the ground level. 🌱,",0.16785714285714287,,nature,
