"""Deciding to send our kid to MindSpace @ Tai Seng, Grantral Mall was a game-changer; we were glad we made that decision. The dedication and hard work put in by the center managers and trainers is nothing short of remarkable. From coaching the kids to managing the center's operations, planning events, and keeping us informed about our child's progress, they handle it all with such finesse, it's like watching a well-oiled machine in action. Before MindSpace, our child seemed to exhibit learning challenges and behavioral hurdles: throwing tantrums when asked to do home work, unable to comprehend basic arithmetic, and disliking classes. We were pleasantly surprised that after going to MindSpace, he is actually looking forward to attend MindSpace. His attitude towards homework has improved, and he is showing significant improvement in behaviour. We were happy when the school teachers told us that they noticed an improvement with our child. It's got me thinking-if MindSpace can work wonders for our child, maybe they have a secret recipe for adults too. MindSpace, any chance of an adult program? Sign me up; I'm ready to experience that transformation firsthand!",0.09313725490196079,Topic 1,"['school', 'child', 'time', 'teacher', 'centre', 'day', 'parent', 'son', 'month', 'kid', 'bad', 'baby', 'principal', 'cry', 'send', 'like', 'know', 'money', 'enrol', 'feel']",MindSpace @ Tai Seng (Grantral Mall) | After School Student Care for P1-P5 | MindChamps Enrichment for P1-P5

"Sending my niece to Mindspace@Tai Seng is the best education decision I have made! My niece (a typical heartlander) became more interactive, can articulate and express herself better. When I run into logistics coordination problems, the business owner, Ching & her team staff helped me with sincere and stress-free assistance with great initiative. It had helped me in dual capacity as in improving both education where I can focus on work concentration.

"I chanced upon this after school student care through a leaflet sent in my mailbox. Initially, I did not think very much about it till I met my sister who then just recovered from a nasty episode of COVID. I could see that she was definitely not as fit as before and on top of that, she shared that her grandson is attending several after school enrichment programmes in the week. Being the day carer for this boy, she has to make multiple trips per day. There I was looking at the leaflet for the second time that week and realised that this could solve some of the issues my sister was facing. I called up the centre and expressed my concern on behalf of my sister and Ms Ching Ching has been very attentive and empathetic of our situation. She assured me that her centre is able to help us overcome the challenges that we are facing. We attended the open house last December and we liked the place as the setup of the centre is conducive, is bright and the layout is fairly spacious. Everything in there are new as we understand the centre is at its start-up phase and most importantly, it is very convenient for us either by MRT or bus. Without much hesitation, we signed him up and since then, we have been in touch with the trainers, who are also very responsive with our queries and concerns on the day to day basis. The trainers update us frequently on his learning, behaviour as well as suggestions for areas of improvement which we can work with him at home. Due to the close working relationship between the trainers and us, we do see a significantly improvement in his social skills and his academic achievements. I did notice that he is now willing to work with a more challenging peer in this small group setting which otherwise he would avoid even being near to them in a school setting. This value is definitely very well inculcated and many thanks to the trainers in this centre who constantly remind them about peer inclusion and showing empathy towards others. Lastly, we really appreciated the variety of the lunch menu and the quality of the food. The picky eater (my grand nephew) is now open to eating out of his comfort zone. This is definitely a bonus for him and us. To date, we are pleased with his development and we will continue to work with the trainers for the betterment of him.",0.18973581973581974,Topic 5,"['teacher', 'school', 'child', 'kid', 'care', 'good', 'love', 'thank', 'parent', 'principal', 'staff', 'learn', 'son', 'daughter', 'year', 'environment', 'great', 'preschool', 'ms', 'experience']",MindSpace @ Tai Seng (Grantral Mall) | After School Student Care for P1-P5 | MindChamps Enrichment for P1-P5

"Curriculum The MindChamps curriculum and values are unmatched, from day 1 of enrolment, the Mindchamps team addresses your champ by name, and in time to come, my kid addresses each and every one of his subject teacher by name, mutual respect at a young age! Location One of the rare locations in the city where you can literally drop off your kid at the driveway and walk 5 metres to the school, no need to rush into carparks and basements, drop off and pick up is a 1 minute affair, not to mention the MindChamps team makes the effort to recognise your vehicle so your kid is ready to go the moment you walk up to the door, never had to wait longer than a couple of minutes. City Campus The centre lacks an inhouse indoor playground but they do make use of Marina square's public playgrounds for the kids to enjoy themselves, a hidden benefit - my kid seldom goes goo-goo over indoor playgrounds anymore as he does it on school time anyway, and getting him to leave one is easy, the school has conditioned him well. Talk about raising a city kid! Staff Hospitality I recall the first time we visited the centre in the morning, most of the kids were running into the school, and it's with no surprise, there's always a very warm welcome at the door greeting every kid good morning as they get ready through the health checks before school, so they get all hyped up about school the moment they step through the doors. Chinese Education There is a dedicated chinese lessons and teacher for every level, for a family that speaks only English at home, my kid picked up a remarkable amount of Chinese words for his age. Summary A famous chinese proverb goes ""三岁定八十"", if you're looking for a place for your kid to develop with the right values, principles and literal/motor competency, I'll bet my last nickel with the folks here at Marina MindChamps. Update: My sister saw the development in my kid and registered both her elder daughter in the Mindspace program and transfered her younger daughter to a Mindchamps near her place, kudos to the MindChamps team!",0.23554029304029306,Topic 5,"['teacher', 'school', 'child', 'kid', 'care', 'good', 'love', 'thank', 'parent', 'principal', 'staff', 'learn', 'son', 'daughter', 'year', 'environment', 'great', 'preschool', 'ms', 'experience']",MindChamps Performing Arts PreSchool @ Marina Square

"""My son has been in MindChamps since he was 20 months old but transferred to MindChamps Sengkang in June 2023 when he was in N2 because he didn't seem to enjoy his last centre as much as I had hoped he would. Transferring him here was the best decision I've ever made. The teachers in this school are outstanding in every way - they are a truly passionate, nurturing group of educators who love what they do and the children that they teach. And this love is quite evidently reciprocated by the students, who can't seem to get enough of school! My son longs to return to school even on weekends. Thank you for making school a very happy place to be at, as it should be. :) Shout out to Ms Hepzi, Ji Laoshi, Ms Ross, Mr Jeremy, Ms Anne, Ms Amenda and Ms Sharlene for always being so warm and attentive. If you're looking for a preschool that not only excels in its curriculum but provides a safe, nurturing and genuinely compassionate environment, look no further.

"My kid is usually slow to warm up in schools. He appeared very comfortable with the teachers and school in just 3 weeks. The things he learnt is in 6months is way much more than the 7 months he was in the previous school. I believe that school is not just about phonics, language, math and words, but also about knowledge around the world. He often comes back sharing about what he learns and some happenings in school. This is something which was not observed in previous schools. All these attribute to the committed teachers. They genuinely want to know more about the kid and make the effort to engage the kids. The support and nurturing environment is definitely one of the factors that allow him to open up faster. They help the kids to excel further in their strengths while encouraging them to work on their weaknesses. The curriculum in the school emphasises all aspects of development. The kids also get some exposure to performances that helps to build up their confidence. I love the open communication with the teachers. The teachers are very approachable and we do get regular updates about their progress in school. No regrets in sending my kid to the school.

"In June, we enrolled our daughter at MindChamps, and the transformation we've witnessed in her has been truly remarkable. She now effortlessly manages her daily routines and eagerly looks forward to attending school each day. One of the aspects we appreciate the most is the thoughtfully designed curriculum. It caters to the holistic development of our child, addressing her social and emotional skills, which we hold in high regard. MindChamps excels in guiding her social behaviors and provides ample opportunities for her to shine in public settings. Under the leadership of the dynamic Principal, Ms. Amenda, MindChamps has organised community outreach events for the children to participate in. In a short period, our girl has been involved in events such as the ""Grand mall opening ceremony"" and the ""Mid-Autumn Festival performance."" The teaching staff at MindChamps is truly exceptional. Their dedication and professionalism shine through in every interaction. We would like to express our heartfelt gratitude to Ms. Lydia and Ji laoshi, our daughter's form teachers, for their unwavering patience and timely feedback, which have played a significant role in her growth. We also want to extend our appreciation to Ms. Chantille, our daughter's English program (MRW) teacher, for her guidance and support, which have enabled our girl to read English books fluently at her level. When it comes to Music, Mr. Jeremy has been a fantastic mentor, and our daughter now enjoys playing the violin and other instruments. Last but not least, a big thank you to Ms. Hepzi, who consistently adds a fun element to Nuro Move. Your contributions to our daughter's overall development are greatly appreciated. Every day, our daughter discovers something new at this preschool. It's the perfect environment for her to learn, explore, and flourish.

Through our observations and communication with the teachers, we can feel that they genuinely love children and want the best for them. We love the curriculum as well which is pretty comprehensive even for PG level children, where they get to explore the various themes in music, gym, gourmet lessons. It has been an overall positive experience for our family, where we now see our boy showing much more interest in communicating and responding with people.

"My experience with this preschool has been nothing short of exceptional, and I am beyond grateful for the positive impact it has had on my sons. When my older son first started at MindChamps, he never spoke a single word of Mandarin. However, with the incredible guidance of his Chinese teacher, Ji Lao Shi, he has opened up to the language in a way that I couldn't have imagined. It's truly remarkable to see how he has progressed and embraced Mandarin under Ji Lao Shi's care and instruction. One of the things I really love about this school is the extensive exposure it provides to children. My sons have had the opportunity to explore various interests, including learning musical instruments like the violin at such a tender age. They even had the chance to perform at a public venue, and I could see how much they enjoyed the experience. It's heartwarming to witness their enthusiasm for learning and self-expression. The teachers at MindChamps, especially Ji Lao Shi, Miss Lydia, Miss Chantille, Miss Joy, Li Lao Shi, and Ling Lao Shi, are exceptional. They played a pivotal role in easing both my sons' transition into the school. It's evident that they genuinely care and love my children, which, as a parent, is what matters most to me. The support and nurturing environment they provide make all the difference. I must also commend the principal, Miss Amenda, for her attentiveness towards parent feedback. It's truly amazing to have a principal who values and listens to parents' opinions and concerns. Academically and holistically, my sons have shown significant improvement since joining MindChamps Preschool Sengkang. I wholeheartedly recommend this preschool to other parents seeking a nurturing and enriching environment for their children. It's been an incredible journey, and I am excited to see how my sons continue to thrive at this wonderful institution.

When reading, the old mother felt really happy. After all, every parent hopes that their children can develop a good habit of independent learning as they grow up, and have a happy and splendid childhood.

The guidance，patience，and unwavering support have played an instrumental role in her growth. Your creative teaching methods，warm smiles and encouragement will be etched in her heart. You’ve not only taught her lessons from books but also lessons about kindness，respect and the journey of expiration. To her dear classmates，each of you has been a source of joy and inspiration. From shared laughter and adventures，you‘ve made her everyday at school unforgettable. The bonds you have formed are special，and I am grateful for the friendship that have taken root during your time together. I want to express my heartfelt gratitude to all of you. The memories created will always be cherished，and the lessons learned will continue to guide her.

We can always see improvements in her languages, behavior and social attitudes. She often gives us surprises, for example, keeps her own toys, asked for permissions to do certain things, know how to be kind or apologize when something goes wrong, speak proper sentences, able to share her toys and food etc On top of that, the school activities also help her to further develop the mind, writing her very first alphabet and initiate to sit at one corner to flip the books and using her little fingers to go through all the sentences. We did not imagine our active child who just turned 3-year-old, is capable to do all these by herself. We look forward for more of her good character being build up in this school.

Both my children are here from PG to K2 and never once do we have to worry if they would be mistreated or whatsoever at school because the teachers here are experienced and delicated. The outdoor playground is huge and there is water play from time to time. Both my children started off shy and reserved but the teachers managed to help them build up their confidence till they moved on to Primary school as confident individuals. We are so grateful to the teachers here who helped us mound their character so well. They learnt responsibilities, to care and to share. Most importantly, both built up a deep love for attending school, they both were happy and loves attending MindChamps to the extent that they just wish they can turn back time and stay on as babies.

The main teachers are also with the school for a long time. Been with the school for the past 5 years, we have become friends with the teachers and some of them taught both my kids.

"Our children (K2 and N1) are with Mindchamps Preschool @OneKM, or Kinexis, both started at 1.5yrs. They loved every bit of it and looked forward to school every morning, as they never complained about having to attend school. We've seen how well they progressed over the years and we are very pleased to have made this wise choice. We'd highly recommend Mindchamps Preschool to parents who prefer a more holistic approach to teaching and learning. This is particularly important to nurture lifelong interest in learning and to help my children cope with the world ahead of them. Besides, we are also happy with the activities-filled curiculum, perhaps that is the reason why our kids were often entusiatics learning new things. The teachers are always helpful, patient, kind and cheerful, which never failed to amaze us with their passion and dedication to their job. Kudos to the Principal Mrs Koh who did a fantastic job!

"We enrolled our son with Mindchamps Kinex during the circuit breaker through a friend’s recommendation and we never looked back. We were apprehensive initially because of the timing that we enrolled our son, but that quickly dissipated. The school took social distancing and personal hygiene very seriously, requiring the children to wash their hands frequently. They even specially sourced a face shield for them. Pre-covid days, the parents were able to sit in with their child during the first week of school for a smooth transition. This was something we couldn’t do. Rachel understood our anxieties and for the first week, she attached Miss Pearlyn with our son to slowly warm him up to the environment and they gave us constant updates to assure us. Rachel and her whole team of teachers are very loving, passionate, dedicated and nurturing. Every single teacher regardless of the level that they were in charged of, were familiar with every child in Kinex from PG to K2. The feeling they gave us was that the entire school was one big happy family. All the teachers there have been teaching there for a considerable number of years. Attrition rate is low and they have a great seamless system and clockwork going on. This has to be attributed to Rachel’s strong leadership. No child or parent gets left behind. They were there every step of the way with us right from the start, responding to our many queries, allaying our fears and making sure our child and every child gets to fulfill their best potential in their time. They were there to encourage them when needed, yet being firm with him and rewarding him when he does something positive. Besides focusing on the curriculum, Rachel and the teachers also made sure the childrens’ social skills and inculcation of values were not missed out on either. Those to us were more important than the curriculum itself. We did not have to worry one bit putting our son with Mindchamps Kinex whilst working. We know that he was in the best hands. It was very sad and heartbreaking that we had to leave kinex for another branch because we relocated to the other end of the island. We have Rachel and her stellar team to thank for setting such a good foundation in our child that he transited well in the new school. I cannot thank especially Rachel, Miss Neesha, Miss Anna, Miss Pearlyn, feng lao shi, Miss Camille enough. Thank you all girls for all the heart work that you do. ❤️",0.22030129870129866,Topic 5,"['teacher', 'school', 'child', 'kid', 'care', 'good', 'love', 'thank', 'parent', 'principal', 'staff', 'learn', 'son', 'daughter', 'year', 'environment', 'great', 'preschool', 'ms', 'experience']",MindChamps PreSchool @ East Coast

For engaging children with little interaction with Chinese at home) 2. Safe Environment - how they handle misbehaviour, cleaning and sanitisation, and separate bathroom for boys and girls to protect their modesty from young. 3. Holistic education - Not just academic focused but overall exposure to different learnings at their young age (eg. Gym class, confidence in speaking in front of peers, simple cookery class, artwork, playtime in playground, music etc) 4. No homework for parents except for K2 (spelling only).

Specifically I’m very please with the amount of mandarin he is speaking because the exposure to mandarin at home is very limited . The school also does a very good job in communication and sharing the day to day activities with parents. Teachers will regularly send photos of my son at school to let me know what he is doing and how he is doing . There are also a lot of programs planned out for the children to ensure that they developed into all rounded kids . I will definitely recommend the school .,0.21921428571428572,Topic 5,"['teacher', 'school', 'child', 'kid', 'care', 'good', 'love', 'thank', 'parent', 'principal', 'staff', 'learn', 'son', 'daughter', 'year', 'environment', 'great', 'preschool', 'ms', 'experience']",MindChamps PreSchool @ City Square Mall

"I want to share my experience for the past few months with MindChamps Paragon. Some background of my son, who is turning five this year. He has been attending an International school in Brunei since he was two and a half years old before returning to Singapore on the 31st of November. The school with huge compounds, three canteens, excellent facilities, and large playgrounds, even just for kindergarten level. When he was in the international school, he was neutral, neither eager nor enthusiastic about school. During covid lockdown, he didn’t care whether he would be going to school the next day or not. After returning, I decided to enroll my son in Mindchamp Paragon. At first, I wasn’t very optimistic due to the limited area to play compared to the international school in Brunei. But this is what it is when we are in a scarce land city-state. As I would like my son to master his mandarin better, at home, we are only allowed to converse in mandarin as I would want my son to master at least in his mandarin speaking. During the enrolment, I specifically emphasized to the Teachers to encourage my son to speak more mandarin to him instead of English. To my surprise! After the first day of school, my son loves going back to MindChamps Paragon. Every day, even on weekends, without fail, he will ask me if there’s school tomorrow. He had shown so much interest in going to school that he did not have that enthusiasm in his previous school. After the first week of attending Mindchamps paragon, he has improved his mandarin speaking. In the following weeks, my son has shown significant improvements in his eagerness to write and draw, which he has lack of previously. Besides, the teachers went above and beyond to ensure the children were comfortable and well taken care of. This is the first time I have seen such a high level of dedication by the teachers, especially Fan Laoshi, Ms. Cammy, and Ms. Lee. After a long absence from lockdown, when school reopens, toddlers will typically take about a week to accept and adjust to new environments and routines. What took my son a week in the previous school, in mindchamps paragon, only one day. To my surprise, he was eager to go back to school the following day without the first day crying drama or pleading to go home, etc. It’s such a pity that we will be relocating again in the coming month. If it weren’t for relocating, we would be glad to continue with mindchamps paragon as long as the highest level mindchamps provides... My son and I are going to miss this excellent school!

"How to begin .. I can honestly say that we ( me and my son ) both miss Mindchamps very much. Liam practically grew up with this preschool since he was before 2 years old. From PG to K1 .. We appreciate the attentiveness that most of the Teachers give to the Champs professionally and the time they took to brief us every single day during pick up time. Some teachers would do the extra miles to attend to champs with special needs and to be able to understand that each house hold is different. Their roles at school were as equally important as mom’s roles at home, they are giving knowledge and implanting discipline that sometimes parents failed to do at home. We are VERY grateful for the Teachers. I apologize if I missed some names but I honestly hope that it won’t affect any of their good dedications and caring, from Miss Eunice, Wu Laoshi, Fan Laoshi, Miss Bev, Miss Cam, Ms Cleris, Ms Nadia, Ms Jasmine, Mr Jay .. even the previous Ah Yis who used to work there at PRG. I hope the COMPANY can further notice all of Teachers contributions and dedications to the children, can appreciate and care for the Teachers as well, since they play the most important roles in the school ( brand ) development and champs qualities.

"I can still remember the time when I was trying to find the best preschool in Singapore for my then two-year-old boy. I visited a few schools, but none could beat the “This is the right one” feel of MindChamps PreSchool at Paragon. The school was brimming with positivity and light. Children wore big smiles on their faces, greeting their friends, teachers and even schoolmates’ parents; teachers were warm and energetic, and the ambience was bright and colourful. They had me at ‘hello’. Within a year in MindChamps, he is not only speaking in full sentences but spewing out bombastic words that I’ve never heard of in my life. When asked what he likes best about his school, his response is, “My friends and teachers”. I think he doesn’t know how to say it yet, but I believe it’s more than just these two fundamental reasons for him liking school. I think to him, schooling in MindChamps is like an adventure or a journey to exciting discoveries. My husband and I too, are very fond of MindChamps.

The curriculum is good but the environment is not so homely and lack of personal touch. My daughter was absent for many days and hospitalised but there wasn’t a single call from school to check on her. I don’t see principal greeting students in the morning like what other kindergarten does. The checkers (normally not the teachers)will do health check with a serious face and normally doesn’t greet good morning to students. I personally feel the childcare was managed like an enterprise than a school.

"Sending my boy, Asher to MindChamps has been a great decision that both of us as parents have made. Mindchamps has been a great platform for Asher to develop in terms of cognitive and personality. Prior to sending Asher to Mindchamps, he was shy and quiet but Mindchamps has moulded him into an outgoing little boy after 3 years. Apart from that, he has developed into a boy who is observant and shows interest in many things that are around him that has also helped in turning him into a more outgoing person. His frequent questions and enquiries on his surroundings have also contributed to his creative mind because Mindchamps has provided many opportunities for Asher to grow up at his own pace but not forgetting to assist him step outside his comfort zone. In term of cognitive development, Asher has enhanced in language skills especially in English when he learned a lot of vocabulary, syntax and communicative skills through the well-designed syllabus that Mindchamps has developed for the kids. Most importantly, Asher is not a great user of Mandarin but his Mandarin has improved tremendously for the past years, allowing him to be able to communicate more effectively with others. Asher always compliments and enjoys the story telling sessions by the teachers in Mindchamps and he always comes back home telling us what he has learned from the story telling sessions. Sharing has not been his strength but Mindchamps makes him a better one and also builds him to be a conscientious person plus an all-rounder. We are looking forward to see more greatness in him as he progresses to K2.",0.2591049382716049,Topic 5,"['teacher', 'school', 'child', 'kid', 'care', 'good', 'love', 'thank', 'parent', 'principal', 'staff', 'learn', 'son', 'daughter', 'year', 'environment', 'great', 'preschool', 'ms', 'experience']",MindChamps PreSchool @ Holland Village

"Time flies so fast. In the blink of an eye, this is already Jiayi’s last year at Mindchamps. In more than four years, she has grown from a babbling baby to a lively and cheerful girl. School has a great attraction for her. Every morning when she wakes up, she wants to go to school as soon as possible. When she picks her up every day, she ""complains"" about why her mother comes so early and she is reluctant to go home. Fortunately, every teacher at school gave her enough patience and tolerance, and helped her grow better in her study and life. When Jiayi comes back, she often talks about the gentle and patient Mother Zhou, the cheerful and enthusiastic Miss YuSing, the serious and responsible Ji Laoshi, the meticulous Teacher Frances, the humorous Teacher Klement, the talented Teacher Hui Sin, the story-telling Teacher Jasmine... too many The teacher helped her become a better version of herself. Jiayi is a child with a lot of personality, and her thinking is relatively mature. She often shares her anecdotes at school with us like a little adult, and often borrows the words of teachers or parents to argue with us. She likes to ask more and more ""why"" when it comes to learning. She likes to read books, listen to stories, and share the knowledge she learned in school. When getting along with her friends, she likes to share every detail of life with the children, and she also learns to be polite and humble and actively help others. In life, she is a veritable ""little housekeeper"". While doing her own thing well, she also worries about all the things around her. Sometimes she often brings us unexpected surprises. She likes the study tour activities organized by the school, which can help her broaden her horizons and increase her knowledge. We are very happy to see Jiayi’s growth, and we are very grateful to the school and teachers for their efforts. We also hope that she can better enrich herself in the remaining time. Kindergarten is her first step in contacting the society. We are very happy and Let’s work together with Mindchamps to describe her best moments and leave her with the most unforgettable memories!""",0.3286174242424242,Topic 5,"['teacher', 'school', 'child', 'kid', 'care', 'good', 'love', 'thank', 'parent', 'principal', 'staff', 'learn', 'son', 'daughter', 'year', 'environment', 'great', 'preschool', 'ms', 'experience']",MindChamps PreSchool @ Holland Village

"My daughter (now in K1) has been at this school since playgroup and my son just started playgroup this year. Enrolling my son was an easy decision seeing how my daughter has blossomed over the years at mindchamps. The smaller class sizes ensure that students get personalised attention from teachers, who are truly invested in their learning. Lessons, while conducted within the theme/topic for the term, are nonetheless adjusted to the children’s interests, ensuring that the children remain excited to keep on learning. Indeed, the teachers make mindchamps special. It is clear from conversations with them that they are extremely dedicated to their craft and caring for the children, not just the children in the class they teach but the children across all levels. My son’s current teacher, who also taught my daughter in her nursery years, still interacts with my daughter regularly and provides me with feedback. My daughter’s teachers are also constantly looking out for my son and providing me with updates on how he is adjusting to school.

"This preschool has inept, unresponsive franchise owners, whose poor management has caused high staff turnover and distrust from many parents. Our child was with MindChamps Thomson Chinese Preschool for K1 and K2, graduating in 2023. We chose this school as we wanted a Mandarin-immersion programme near our home. While our child had good teachers throughout the two years there, unfortunately, the school was very poorly managed. During this period, 4 principals resigned (the 5th principal will be starting in late-Jan 2024), along with all 6 of our child’s teachers. What is worse is that these 6 teachers left with little to no notice period given to the parents or children. This is despite the management being aware that they resigned several months ahead of time. They deliberately required the teachers not to tell the parents, giving no time for a proper farewell and showing little regard for the relationship between the teachers and the children. The school environment was therefore very unstable, making it difficult for children to form a relationship of trust with their teachers. Just imagine how your child would feel if they started trusting a teacher, only to see her suddenly depart, time after time. During the first wave of resignations in 2022, we were among a group of 9 families who collectively wrote a letter to the franchise owners to express our grave concern. We were deeply dissatisfied with the high staff turnover and their decision to announce the teachers’ departure at very short notice (i.e. 1 day before her last day). Notably, the owners did not bother to respond to us at all. Instead, the new principal tried to assure us she would right the ship. She worked hard and seemed sincere, but soon resigned as well. While we certainly considered changing school, eventually we kept our child there because of the existing friendships and the new teachers were good. It’s also rather disruptive to change school with just a year to go. The K2 year was more stable – we thought the management had finally met minimal standards. Unfortunately, that was not to be the case. In mid-December 2023, both the K2 teachers left the school abruptly. Once again, the management kept the news from us until 3 days before the teachers’ final day. This was baffling, given that the parents had already paid the school fees for December, so they could have given more time to allow the children to process the end of these treasured relationships. From these actions, it is clear that the franchise owners of MindChamps Thomson are lacking in management and people skills. Worse, they do not listen to feedback. Principals did not stay more than 6 months, they could not explain the decisions of the franchise owners, and good teachers left very suddenly, in an unnecessarily disruptive manner. We have no confidence in the franchise owners, and believe parents should know about their history before deciding to enrol. Ultimately, while the teachers are good and committed, the preschool management is not child-centric. Here is a final example: MindChamps Thomson scheduled the K2 graduation concert on 3 December, obviously to get parents to pay for that month’s enrolment. Several families planned to travel in Dec to visit family overseas etc and thus appealed to have the concert earlier. However, the management rejected the appeal. As a result, several children were not allowed to join the graduation concert, even if their parents were willing to pay the $373 concert/graduation package. This is simply mean and profit-obsessed. Most other preschools hold their graduation concerts in November, and even October. We think teachers, parents and children deserve much better.",0.0693823831535696,Topic 5,"['teacher', 'school', 'child', 'kid', 'care', 'good', 'love', 'thank', 'parent', 'principal', 'staff', 'learn', 'son', 'daughter', 'year', 'environment', 'great', 'preschool', 'ms', 'experience']",MindChamps Chinese PreSchool @ Thomson

"Kids learn faster than adults and, being 50% Chinese, I believe it is essential that our children be exposed to the Chinese culture and language early on.

However, young children adapt quickly and before we knew it, he started acquiring new vocabulary and was responsive when I communicated with him in Mandarin.

"Our girl’s PG to K2 journey in MC Punggol is coming to an end this month and it has been an extremely enriching experience for her. We could see significant improvements in her behavior in the past 2 years and the MC Punggol team deserves a shoutout for it. Regular updates on our girl’s development from the app, parent-teacher meetings and quick 5-minute chats with teachers after school has been very helpful as it allows us to “continue” the learning with our child at home. Post-Covid, the school began to resume a lot of activities such as farm visits (crocodile, fish, goat, vegetable etc.), excursions (Changi Experience Studio), outdoor activities (Splash @ Kidz Amaze), Sports Day and cultural celebrations to make learning fun and enjoyable at the same time. As parents we also looked forward to taking part in some of these activities with our kids. The curriculum in my opinion is quite well-balanced and focuses on different areas of development. While preparation for Primary 1 is important, the champs also spend substantial time on learning various musical instruments (violin!), arts and crafts, cultural diversity and outdoor activities to stimulate development in other areas and build up their character. Our girl was fortunate to be taught by several wonderful and dedicated teachers who are always looking out for her. The principal Veron, form teachers Mr. Tze and 杨老师 constantly updated us on her meltdowns in school and this helped us greatly in correcting her behavioral issues. Mr. Tze's encouraging and motivating attitude is really ""contagious"" and we could see our girl being influenced positively by him. 柴老师, whom we know so well by now and possibly the active longest-serving teacher there, will personally watch over her whenever she has her bad days and calm her down. Jerome and Katherine have also been proactive in sharing feedback on our girl’s development in music and reading. Our boy who is in Nursery was assigned to the young and vibrant pair of 小恩 and Tiffany who could match his energy levels and we could feel their genuine attachment to the toddlers under them from their dedication and efforts towards the preparation for the Year-End Musical showcase. Location wise, the school may not be conveniently accessible but having its own little gym, library, and outdoor playground more than makes up for it. It can be quite a pain during wet weather as the walkway from the main road bus stop to the school is unsheltered. To sum it up, MC Punggol team really outdone themselves in making the 2 biggest events of the year, the Family Fiesta and the Year-End Musical, a great success. I believe a lot of parents were touched by the performances and proud of their champs. The hours spent on choreographing the dance, rehearsals, handmaking the costumes and props is a testament to the passion and dedication of the whole MC Punggol team under the leadership of Veron. We are really grateful to the teachers who will be departing the school after leading the champs through these milestones in their preschool journey and for the positive impact on them. I would not hesitate to recommend MC Punggol to parents who are looking for a preschool and willing to pay more for the higher education standards and conducive environment. PS: We were impressed by Sheryl's attentiveness to my dad's condition and for taking the initiative to change my parents' seats for the Musical.

"I speak from the experience of being a father of two who are attending Mindchamps Punggol Northshore, and this is my honest opinion of the establishment. Location wise it might not be the most convenient to some, but the environment and infrastructure together with real estate space more than makes up for it. I have been impressed by the general state of cleaniness and hygiene control of the school whenever I visit the place, and the seemingly much lower rates of HFMD/Influenza spreads within the school is probably a good tesitmony of that. While as with every establishment we cannot expect the quality of every single teacher to be of the highest standard of excellence, I have observed that generally most if not all of the staffs have displayed a good level of understanding with regards to how they should effectively carry themselves in various situations. It is clear that training is prioritized on a management level for that to be achieved (think Hai Di Lao, but for schools). A huge plus point is it's not uncommon to see staffs who are truly passionate about what they do and enjoy being surrounded by kids. Annoyance or irritation from the staff is an extremely rare sight if any. I am impressed by how most of the staff make the effort to know every child's name and even attempt to build rapport with each of everyone of them. It's comforting to know that there are multiple staffs and teachers who approach their work with their hearts daily. I do not think this would be possible without the likes of Ms Veron, Mr Jerome and Cai Laoshi (to name a few but there's more), who have definitely helped in creating a healthy culture and environment within the establishment for children to grow and shine in. I dare confidently say that most children who graduate from Mindchamps Punggol Northshore will enjoy a headstart in their primary school journey.

"I'm a parent of 2 kids who are currently in this branch for about 4 years and lucky to have found this branch for our kids. The branch has a strong curriculum and always has the kids' well-being as their priority. While there is a strong curriculum in place, they also teach based on the class's interest. This is important to sustain kids' curiosity in learning. For example for N1 classes learning about farm animals, The teachers will hold conversations with the kids and find out their interests. With this, class A would have a slightly different aspect from class B based on their kid's interests. With the opening up from covid situation, they have increased their excursions, such as theatre play, goat farm, crocodile farms as well! The kids enjoyed themselves a lot. The teachers are dedicated and always go above and beyond their primary responsibility. They always provide timely and valuable feedback on your kids and allow parents to know how they are in school, etc. The principal and admin staff are very responsive as well. All in all, I would say that this branch is indeed a flagship branch of mind champ where they have a good curriculum, good systems and processes, good teachers, and admin staff. Do note that not all mind champ branches are the same. After hearing about the experiences that my friends had with other branches.

We as parents are well aware that handling a very active and restless child like my son isn't the easiest, but the teachers try their best and are transparent about how they manage and at times discipline him. My special thanks to 李老师 - her updates (through phonecalls and chats during pickup) are always very astute, sharp and insightful. It only goes to show she isn't just child minding - she is thoughtful about the children's behaviour and tries to interpret what they might mean. It means a lot to me that she takes the time to troubleshoot issues with me, and never once comes across as judgemental. This is so important to a parent. 2) Thank you to the enrichment teachers too - Mr Jerome, Ms Lash, and Ms Hanah. My son comes back telling me all sorts of things he's learnt — log rolling in gym class, takadimi rhythm in music class, and spheres (!) in literacy class. It's really funny and heartening at the same time. And he's only 3! 3) And lastly to everyone else - principal Ms Veron, admin staff and the other teachers : thank you for always being welcoming and smiley during drop off (even when us as parents are not! 😂). It makes a difference how kids are welcomed. Thank u Mindchamps Northshore :)",0.17750270562770562,Topic 5,"['teacher', 'school', 'child', 'kid', 'care', 'good', 'love', 'thank', 'parent', 'principal', 'staff', 'learn', 'son', 'daughter', 'year', 'environment', 'great', 'preschool', 'ms', 'experience']",MindChamps PreSchool @ Punggol

"My son has been with Punggol Northshore Mindchamp for more than a year since he was 22 months old. What first made me chose this school is the curriculum of Mindchamp, the good reputation and the school’s cleanliness & environment. I am glad to have sent my boy to Mindchamp punggol because I observed how well-run this place is, passionate teachers and how well-thought lesson plans their have. 1. The teachers truly cares for the students through small little actions that I have observed. They are patience, caring and well-trained. My boy feels very comfortable with them. 2. What impresses me is that all teachers receiving and sending off the kids at the reception remember each and every student names! How attentive it is. 3. The principal, Ms Veron runs the school very well. She is hands-on, decisive, attentive, and approachable. She impresses me with how she handles every covid situation - transparent reporting, clear instruction and personally calling parents to follow-up. With her running the school, it gives me assurance.

"My daughter has been attending Mindchamps Punggol Northshore since she was 2 years old(PG). If you are looking for a school with comprehensive curriculum, this is the school that you can consider.

Their focus is not only on academic wise, they also build the champs' character, self-esteem, emphasising on mannerism. There are always timely updates on latest cases on HFMD/Covid on teacher-parent apps, which is really assuring especially when they ensure deep cleaning is carried out each time.

All these efforts spent despite her being heavily pregnant. Our English speaking child now sings Chinese songs, recites Chinese poems and is able to recognise and read Chinese words when back home from school.

"I had a negative experience with MindChamps. I registered, paid a deposit, and two months' fees to secure a promotional rate during registration. I completed all required forms and waited for my daughter's class to begin in less than two months. However, about two to three weeks after registration, I received a call informing me of a fee increase. The staff told me that if I do not agree with the increment, I can choose to withdraw and they will refund fully. But this was not what I was initially told during sign-up. I'm aware that I'm not the only parent affected by this. MindChamps did not honor their promise, and the principal unashamedly mentioned a clause that is ‘allowing them to change terms and conditions without notice’, which left me stunned. Their sales tactic was to lock in a special 12-month fee promotion during the special registration period. I find MindChamps Singapore's actions disappointing and unacceptable. But anyway, thanks to their management, this turned out to be a blessing in disguise for us. I'm extremely relieved that my child is not part of this school. I personally know a few music teachers working at MC. While I understand that personal lives should generally not be intertwined with one's profession as a teacher working there, I can't help but feel a great sense of relief that my child is not being taught or cared for by certain music teachers.",0.034837092731829576,Topic 5,"['teacher', 'school', 'child', 'kid', 'care', 'good', 'love', 'thank', 'parent', 'principal', 'staff', 'learn', 'son', 'daughter', 'year', 'environment', 'great', 'preschool', 'ms', 'experience']",MindChamps PreSchool @ Toa Payoh

"Sending my son to Mindchamps TPY preschool since Nursery. Very big spacious preschool with individual classrooms, activity rooms ,music room, gourmet room etc and mindscape indoor playground and more. My son picked up strong vocal skills and confidence and he writes his alphabets and numbers well even before turning 4. He recognizes simple words when reading. My son is able to wear his uniform ,socks and shoes independently too as he learned these skills in school with constant practice.. I like the fact that there is a good amount of both play and academics in Mindchamps curriculum (which is very important in this era). They have started going on outdoor learning journeys too after the COVID restrictions have been eased. And of course the friendly and caring teachers as well - Form teacher, Chinese Lao Shi and other enrichment teachers !!

This helped us understand our daughter’s needs and emotions better. The teachers are responsible and trustworthy whom always maintain effective parents-teachers communication for tracking our daughter’s progress.

"Definitely a great place for your kids to have fun and learn at the same time. Enrolled my child into Mindchamp Buangkok for PG class and we were amazed at the rate she has grown and developed.

Dedicated and inspiring teachers who spent extra efforts in decorating the classrooms to fit the theme of the lesson plan.

A good mixture of engaging, fun and systematic curriculums allows the child to get hands on experiences where my child enjoyed very much.

The principal and administrative staff are also very accommodating and responsive to the needs of the parents.

"Our daughter commenced her journey at Mindchamps Buangkok (""MCBKK"") since N1 way back in early 2019. She participated and we just attended her K2 graduation ceremony 3 weeks back and she will be leaving Mindchamps as a confident and articulate ""K3"" to start her P1 formal education very shortly. During the course of the last 4 years, both my wife and I have much to thank the whole team at MCBKK principle, teachers and support staff. It is inevitable that there will always be turnover for any childcare though I know MCBKK will try their best to retain and replace. Kids are also more resilient than what most parents think and adapt quickly. Nonetheless as I reflect, would I have trusted my daughter with MCBKK all over again? The answer is a definite ""yes' for the following reasons. - Great partnership between parents and entire MCBKK team, bus driver and bus auntie included. - Genuine and professional teachers and staff who really care and bother - Clean, bright and cheerful environment - Holistic educational experience that covers English, Chinese, Math, reading, writing, physical education, art, gourmet, performance and music just to name some. - Honest and timely feedback from teachers - Supportive fellow parents and wonderful classmates Covid was a trying period for all of us and I could appreciate the amount of consideration, stress and work that went behind as the MCBKK team tried to maintain a safe and healthy environment for the kids while keeping up with their programme. Special mention Ms Ng, Ms Yun, Ms Shannon, Ms Mabel, Ms Beth, Ms Amanda, Ms Cass, Ms Fu, Ms Stella and ex-teachers Ms Eileen and Ms Zhang Qian. A big Thank You to all of you! All of you have been instrumental in one way or another for our child's growing up journey. We are always grateful and appreciative and definitely like to share our gratitude and experience with any parents who are currently in their taunting process of selecting a pre-school for their little ones. There is no perfect pre-school but only the most suitable one. For us, we are happy to have partnered MCBKK for our child's journey.

"After months of searching for a preschool for my daughter, I have finally found Mindchamps Buangkok to be our preferred choice in this neighborhood. Likely to be one of the best that offers an all-rounded curriculum and one with personalized feedback . We have seen a significant progression in our daughter's learning journey since she was transferred from another preschool at N1 last year. One example is that my daughter is able to recognise her name and write it independently now. Kudos to the dedicated team that Principal Shannon leads.

"Last year, we visited a few preschools in the midview city area and found Mindchamps to be really impressive. The campus is big and clean. There are a number of facilities within the school: indoor playground, water playground, gym and music class. The centre head Mr Desmond gave a good introduction to the school and he was very patient at answering questions. The curriculum sounded really good so we decided to enrol our son in. We originally planned to let our son start PG in December this year but due to sudden changes in caretaking availability, we urgently needed help. Thankfully the school was able to accommodate us and let our boy in earlier by a month. Thank you to vice principal Ms Alice for helping us with this urgent request. We appreciate this very much. I accompanied my boy for his first 2 days of school and found that the teachers there are really nurturing and dedicated. As my boy has not attended school before, I was initially worried about him adapting to school life. My boy’s class teachers Ms Jocelyn Tan and 郭老师 were very assuring. Following through the class, I could see that they are very caring and engaged with the children really well. They also took time to report on my child’s status and the activities they carried out. I can feel that my son is in safe hands. After one month of school, my son has settled in well. I also noticed my son verbalizing a lot more words and became more independent.

"Beware the $70 waitlist. It's a great education facility, but if it's a full-house for your kid's level, they may ask you to pay $70 to be added to a waitlist. ** Read this then make up your mind** If it was a waitlist that works like normal waitlists (a vacancy becomes available, next-in-line gets a slot), then great! But I'm aware of people who have managed to cut queue without even joining the waitlist at all. Same level as my kid, same full house they should have encountered. If I didn't know the kid who (unknowingly) cut the queue, I'd still be (foolishly) waiting today. If this school is knowingly taking money and not fulfilling their end of the deal, sounds like a scam to me. If there are loopholes in their system, that's plain incompetence.

When they do that, everything else falls into place: the type of teachers they hire, the decisions management makes and eventually, the crowd they attract.

"It was very nice to receive our very first termly report on our child's (TL) progress in his first 10 weeks at MindChamps. How time flies. We thought it is only apt that we would like to write this letter to express our gratitude and appreciation for all the wonderful things Ms Arina and 冯老师 have done as preschool teachers. Their passion, dedication, and commitment to shaping the minds and lives of young children is truly admirable, and we are grateful for the positive impact they have had on our little one. From the moment little TL started attending their class, it was clear that they are not just a teacher, but also a caring and nurturing mentor They have a gift for making every child feel valued, heard, and supported, which is so important in building their confidence and self esteem. Their patience, kindness, and enthusiasm have helped our little TL develop a love for learning and a sense of curiosity about the world around him. He would come home singing the songs he learned ""Ee i ee I o.."". We can tell how attached he is towards Ms Arina and 冯老师. They would patiently coax him to nap and have their ways of comforting him. Their creativity and imagination in designing age appropriate activities and lessons have made learning fun and engaging for him. We are constantly amazed by the projects and crafts little TL works on (from the many photos shared by both teachers), and how much he has grown in his cognitive and motor skills. Their abilities to tailor their teaching to each child's unique needs and learning style is truly remarkable, and we are grateful for the individual attention and care they give to him. As parents, we know that we can trust them to provide a safe and nurturing environment for our little one. Their communication and collaboration with us have been invaluable in keeping us informed about little TL's progress and development. We truly appreciate their willingness to listen to our concerns and feedback, and to provide suggestions and work with us in supporting his growth and development. On a special note, we would also like to extend our appreciation to 钱老师 whose presence is always able to calm little TL down at the daily morning reception. Many times, she would be sharp to notice his eyes welling up and will always be able to provide comfort and a change of emotions in him (and probably in us parents too). In short, we would like to thank them for being exceptional preschool teachers. Their impact on our little one's life and education will be felt for years to come, and we are forever grateful for the role they have played in shaping his future. Their hard work and dedication have not gone unnoticed, and we hope they know how much they are appreciated.

From the sweetest teachers and principals to the wonderful parents, everyone is closely bonded. Last month, our class organized a food donation drive, which deeply touched both me and my daughter. It was incredibly meaningful to be able to help needy families in our community. From packing to sorting to distributing, we all worked together seamlessly. Studying here isn’t just about teachers and students..it feels like a second home.

"We recently participated in the food donation drive event organized by MindChamps, and it was an incredibly rewarding experience for our family. Not only did we have the opportunity to contribute to a worthy cause, but we also witnessed firsthand the positive impact it had on our child. Through this event, our child learned the importance of generosity, empathy, and community involvement. Seeing the joy on the faces of those who received our donations was truly heartwarming and left a lasting impression. We are grateful for the dedication and hard work of our child's teachers, Ms. Lydia and Shu Ling Lao Shi, and the center Principle, Ms. Sharlene who instill these values on a daily basis. Additionally, the support and involvement of the parent community around our child's class were instrumental in the success of the event.

"We started our firstborn at Mindchamps J10 since Playgroup, and the curriculum has exposed her to opportunities for a holistic growth in the domains of language, cognitive development and socio-emotional skills. The school also provides a conducive environment for learning with its well thought-out and organized classrooms and facilities. She returns home excitedly every day and shares with us the activities and experiences she has gone through in school. Not only has she formed strong friendships with her classmates (us parents have formed great friendships too!), but also developed good rapport with her supportive teachers and even non-teaching staff. Communication between parents and teachers has always been transparent and prompt with the Mindchamps app, as we are constantly updated with our child’s progress and well-being in school. Her increasing independence and curiosity stand as evidence of the effectiveness of Mindchamp’s pedagogical approach and the professionalism of J10’s teaching team. Our secondborn started his school journey in July 2023. At just slightly over 6 months, we have noticed remarkable progress in his language, numeracy, and social interaction skills.

"We went to 4 preschools school tour before deciding to enrolled our girl over to j10 Mindchamps. What made us chose j10 MC : We love their new renovated playground, it is safe and sheltered. Kids can have water play, picnic and many fun activities there! As their playground is located out of the mall, We were worried that it might be too noisy.. so we went to check the traffic condition at several timing, and to our surprise, only peak hours about 5.30-6pm there was an increase of traffic. We also like how they communicate effectively with parents in their own school app. I get to see updates like - what time my girl enters school, temperature checking and more. So much thought and effort is put into the educational activities as well. I know my daughter loves being here, and i wouldn't take her anywhere else. We’re so happy with our decision.

"My elder daughter started with MC @J10 since it 1st opened up in 2015. In a flash of an eye, 6yrs had passed and now my younger daughter is going to spend her last year in MC in 2022. I'm happy to see how my girls had developed overall throughout the years they had been in the centre (not just in studies, but even in the soft skills like leadership, adaptability, problem solving and social cohesiveness). We had always found the teachers and directors at MC @J10 to be approachable and genuine in wanting to care for the children under them (maybe we were just blessed that my 2 girls had great teachers). I had observed how improvements were made to the infrastructure over the years. I had seen the outdoor playground get refurbished into a garden area before a new playground was added as well. This makes water play so much more meaningful when we still remember how it originally was. With the addition of the Allied care centre below, I have no doubt that the centre's management is looking towards providing awesome care for a larger spectrum of children (including those who might need additional assistance to integrate better into mainstream education). Kudos to their foresight and planning! Here's to wishing MC @J10 and it's teaching staffs many more fantastic years ahead, creating better futures for our future generations!

"We started our son Isaac at Mindchamps J10 when he was 1.5 years old, just before the Covid pandemic started. He showed great affinity for the school as he was attentive and curious while we were taking a tour of the campus – and since then he has embarked on a thrilling journey with the kindergarten. Mindchamps provides a conducive environment for Isaac to learn and grow over the years – he picked up social skills quickly and displays proficiency in both Mandarin and English (yes he even challenges our vocabulary now!) and it is evident he has a great love for music and reading. We especially appreciate the hard work put in by the teachers and staff at MindChamps J10 during the Covid period when classes were conducted online and regular updates were provided to parents through the Mindchamps app with lots of pictures and curriculum details. And the teachers put in a lot of effort to give us a detailed write up of what Isaac learns every term, not just in English but also in Chinese. We are very glad that we can share photos of what Isaac does in school everyday with his grandparents as well! Now Isaac looks forward to going to school every morning (Not just because of Fun Toast!) but he tells us that he looks forward to seeing his teachers and friends – so much so he wants to stay back after school hours to continue playing with his classmates.

As parents, we are grateful and appreciative of the school and teachers' effort to take in our feedback and work together. Kyler used to have issues with pronunciation and was apprehensive of saying out new words. It was the school and teachers teamwork that helped nurture Kyler into a confident child. He is no longer afraid of pronouncing the word wrongly, and takes it as a challenge and enjoys the fun of learning. Since playgroup until K2, on a weekly basis, kyler has to bring back English and Chinese reading books provided by the school. And everyweek without fail, we would read with him. This has become a reading habit for kyler and us to read and bond together through the book section. With the introduction of violin into the music program, Kyler discovered his passion for music and fun with violin.

There is never a single day that he refused or was reluctant to go to school, and this shows that the really engaging teachers and the environment. Thank you Mindchamps@J10.

"MindChamps Preschool fully embodies the elements that both my wife and I were looking for when we were looking for a school for Athena. We had a tour within the school compound, and we spoke to the staffs about a possible enrolment which left us hugely impressed with the level of detail and assurance that they have given to us. Without a doubt, we signed up for Athena on the spot. The school environment is very clean, organized, and well-thought out. It provides a conducive learning and safe playing environment for the children. The curriculum not only develops the child in academics, but it enhances their motor, emotional, musical, and social interaction abilities as well. This is truly a holistic way of nurturing our children as they advance through their early childhood. Athena started her journey with MindChamps J10 in January 2021. At just slightly over a year mark, we have noticed remarkable progress in Athena’s language, numeracy, and social interaction skills. From the early days of reaching the school entrance in tears to where we are today, she is loving and enjoying every little moment that she has spent in school. Almost every other day, she would ecstatically return home and explain to us in great length on what she has done for the day. We were also pleasant to find that she has developed a good rapport with her class and several strong friendships within her classmates. It makes her day in school even more fulfilling. Communication between the staffs and parents are transparent and prompt. Through digital means such as the MindChamps App and email, we are constantly being updated with our child’s progress and school matters. The Covid-19 pandemic has been with us for almost a good 2 years. Whilst many schools could not organize group activities or outdoor field-trips due to the pandemic restrictions, MindChamps J10 were able to think out of the box and help to engage the children in different meaningful ways. My wife and I would like to thank MindChamps J10 wholeheartedly for creating such a pleasant environment for Athena to learn and play. We look forward to seeing Athena progressing through her early childhood in MindChamps J10.",0.25497807017543855,Topic 5,"['teacher', 'school', 'child', 'kid', 'care', 'good', 'love', 'thank', 'parent', 'principal', 'staff', 'learn', 'son', 'daughter', 'year', 'environment', 'great', 'preschool', 'ms', 'experience']",MindChamps PreSchool @ Junction 10

"Our son, Jesse has come a long way since he joined Mindchamps @ Junction 10 at 18 months young. Being one that is very attached to us, it was a challenge assimilating him into a new environment. It was therefore a huge relief to receive timely updates/pictures from the school reassuring us that he was doing alright. 1.5yrs on, he waits at the door all ready to leave for school, no cries, no struggle. At pickup, he would be his usual cheerful self telling us about his day, what he ate, what he did etc. We really appreciate the attention that has been provided to him by everyone in school, and more importantly see how he has notably gown into someone with confidence and exemplary speech capability.

"My daughter joined Mindchamp with her good friend when she was in K1. In the blink of an eye, it was time for her to graduate. Every day when she came home from school, she would happily share with me what happened at school today and what kind of food she cooked at school. She would also confidently tell me that she would teach me on the weekend. Make, the most delicious food in the world that I learned to make in school today, etc. These sharings let me know that she has a fulfilling life at school every day, has a group of good friends, and has great teachers, so I can trust my daughter to the school. Of course, occasionally, my daughter will be unhappy at school, and she will tell me what happened, why she was unhappy, the teacher's reaction, etc. Every time I see the teacher handle it very fairly, which makes me feel at ease. K2 The school organized many activities this year to allow children to better connect with kindergarten and primary school, such as visiting Zhenhua Primary School, learning to recognize coins, etc. It allows my daughter and the children in the class to understand what primary school will look like in the future, and also gives them full confidence and expectations for primary school learning. Through various activities in the school, the parents of the classmates also become familiar with each other and become a big family, communicating with each other and growing together.

"Having gone through less than ideal experiences with previous childcare centres, we were stringent about finding the right one for Chloe. Thankfully, we gave MindChamps PreSchool @ Yio Chu Kang a chance – and fast forward to today, we are glad to have made that decision. It was a challenging time for Chloe, who at 4, had to adapt to a new sibling and a new school environment at the same time. We are grateful to have Ms. Michelle as her main teacher, who is very passionate, dedicated, attentive and most importantly, genuinely interested in the well-being of the children. She assured us that Chloe would develop well under her guidance and indeed she benefited from the excellent learning environment. We are also grateful for 宋老师, who within a short span of time has helped Chloe to improve dramatically in Chinese, especially in terms of handwriting and her careful attention to the Chinese strokes (笔画). We are truly blessed to have another amazing teacher in this school. Finally, it is great leadership that pushes exemplary qualities in the staff and teachers. For this, we have Mr. Dave to thank for he never fails to listen to our feedback and recommendations despite his busy schedule.

"My elder daughter joined in 2019 N2 level when the school just started operating. She felt at home instantly from the first day. In her 3yrs with Mc Nordcom2, I have never heard from her that she does not want to go to school in the morning. It says a lot about the overall vibe and cheerful environment that is truly unique to this school. She graduated in 2021 and moved on to primary school and I must say that mindchamp nc2 teachers prep their graduates very well for transitioning to primary school (spelling, show n tell, numerical etc). She was awarded all-rounder award at the end of her p1 academic year. My younger boy joined in 2021 PG. I must thank the school and teacher for helping him transition from home to PG smoothly. He took around 2 weeks to get used to morning routine of going to school. Beyond that on most days, he does not struggle going to school. We saw him grew tremendously in term of language skill, motor skill, social skill, music skill etc. We were so thankful that it was his teacher who potty trained him successfully while we as parent were struggling to train him at home. From the very start he joined, the school teachers has kept very open and transparent communications in partnering with us as parents handling the various request and feedback. This is made possible thanks to the support of the school management championed by the centre director, who also happen to be the owner Ms Nicol.

"I cannot recommend Mindchamps @Upper Thomson enough for parents looking for a more engaging and nurturing environment for their little ones. My daughter enrolled there when she was 18 months old. She was very shy, so teachers must have made a tremendous effort to make my daughter feel safe and secure there very quickly. My daughter has developed many skills and learned so much during her time at school, from eating and sleeping on her own, socializing with her peers, to learning her colors, shapes, and numbers etc in both English and Chinese. The music, dance, and drama lessons at this preschool offer a great introduction for us to discover our daughter's interests and talents. Mr Alim, Ms Misellya and Mr Nas did an amazing job to make these lessons so enjoyable. The school also offers weekly reading program and monthly outing program, which we find very enriching and interesting. What sets this preschool apart, though, is the staff's dedication to each child's individual needs and personalities. The PG class size is so small (teacher to student ratio is 2:6) that teachers take the time to get to know each child and tailor their care and education accordingly. My daughter adores her class teachers- Ms Nor & Lin Laoshi, who are both very passionate and responsive and understand my daughter's needs perfectly.

"We always thought that all pre-schools are the same i.e., how different can it be when all we need is a daycare center where children just eat, sleep, and play?

She also particularly enjoys the music, dance, and drama classes, which we are also kept very informed by the frequent newsletters and updates from the teachers. With the weekly reading activities encouraged by the school in partnership with the parents at home, our LO has also cultivated the habit of reading (accompanied) and her love for books. The smaller class size and undivided attention worked well for our LO who thrives in a more intimate environment.

It is clear to us that she looks up to and adores her teachers, and enjoys her time in school, as she always smiles when we talk about her teachers and is always pretending to be the teacher at home to her cuddly toys.

"I love the experience I've had with Mindchamps @ Woodlands. We've been with the school for about a year plus and I feel that the teachers and staff have been really thoughtful and loving towards my child. There's no issue with sending him to school and he adapted to the environment really quick. It speaks volumes about their level of care because my baby usually cries a lot with strangers when he was younger. The teachers would also communicate closely with us parents to explore ways in which we can better my child's development and I am glad to know that the teachers do understand my child's temperament, development and habits really well. Thus, this has been reassuring to know that my child is in good hands of professionals who are experienced with dealing children as unique individuals. I also love that the school's academic approach is dynamic, where teachings aren't confined to the classroom. I love how my child is able to communicate what he learned in school to me when I come home from work. More importantly, I do appreciate the occasional drops of photos through the Mindchamps app like the attached photos, where I get exclusive updates of their time in school. I cannot thank the teachers enough for providing a loving and nurturing environment for the children.

"Before choosing MindChamps, I visited other schools for comparison. Ultimately, I chose MindChamps Woodlands for several main reasons: 1:The school's core value is respecting children with zero intimidation. as a mother, this was my top priority. 2:The educational philosophy of the school's 10 core values attracted me. 3:MindChamps Woodlands is directly affiliated with the MindChamps headquarters. 4:The school environment is great, very comfortable, and clean. 5:The transparent curriculum planning and the careful selection of food for children made me feel more assured. Without hesitation, I chose MindChamps Woodlands. after my child started at this kindergarten, I felt reassured (i still rmb i was crying together with my son in the first few days to school.). The school's app updates on child's situations time to time daily. Most importantly, my child enjoys going to school. despite relocating (the new home being about an hour's drive from MindChamps Woodlands), we visited new MindChamps schools with the intent to transfer. However, my child firmly insists on staying at MindChamps Woodlands with their teachers and classmates. i always believe that the child's heart is pure, and I believe their choice follows their innermost preference. although it's tough, both my hubby and I respect our child's choice. This little boy strives not to be late for school every day, waking up between 6:50-7:00 am consistently for over half a year. Whenever I ask about his favorite teacher or subject, he always says, I love all the teachers, and I enjoy all the subjects.' But he especially loves the time spent in MindGym and MindSpace. Witnessing my child's joyful anticipation of going to school every day is the happiest moment when sending him to school. Many friends send their children for English tuition, but I feel at MindChamps, I witnessed my child's gradual transformation, not aiming for the best, but improving every day,day by day,bit by bit. This is what I have seen and been most moved by in my child. The MRW and ReadAlong app at MindChamps make it unnecessary for us, a non-English-speaking family, to provide additional tutoring. Of course, this varies from person to person. However, at this stage, I've seen this in my child, and we allow him to progress at his own pace. Over the years, MindChamps Woodlands and all the teachers have given my child warmth, care, and guidance, nurturing him bit by bit from a small boy into a confident, warm, and sunny big boy. He is graduating K2 this year. Initially, to provide 100% companionship in a warm growing environment for my child, I chose to leave the workforce. Children has to grow in each stage, and as a mother, I believe the nurturing environment and people around them, be it at home or school, are most important. At this moment, I am proud to say my best decision was choosing MindChamps Woodlands.and in primary school, Mindchamps mindspace 's art of learning and continued education on ten value attracted me again. we also signed up for mindspace without hesitation as after school student care center for my child .i believe it will be my another best decision. Sincerely thanks all the teachers for everything ❤️. Your presence makes parents like me feel more secure. And it's because of your silent dedication and guidance that I am even prouder of everything my child has achieved.",0.22992322979165086,Topic 5,"['teacher', 'school', 'child', 'kid', 'care', 'good', 'love', 'thank', 'parent', 'principal', 'staff', 'learn', 'son', 'daughter', 'year', 'environment', 'great', 'preschool', 'ms', 'experience']",MindChamps PreSchool @ Woodlands

"Our daughter has been studying at MindChamps@Woodlands for almost 4.5 years. She enjoys going to school everyday. We are very pleased with the school teachers, facilities and programs. Teachers at MindChamps are professional, caring and dedicated. We appreciate the constant communication with the teachers through app messages, face-to-face meetings, weekly and monthly reports. Up-to-date trainings for the teachers ensure the quality of teaching and learning provided to the students. The classrooms are inviting and conducive for learning. Our daughter enjoys playtime at MindGym and MindScape. The MindScape is a new playground facility that is only available at Woodlands and Toa Payoh branches. The program at MindChamps has allowed my child to build a strong foundation. She is able to vocalise her thoughts and express herself well. Lessons such as the show-and-tell sessions, Creativity and Theatrical Strategies have allowed her to build up her confidence and presentation skills. The Reading and Writing lessons enable her to read and write independently from a young age. She also enjoys her MindChamps Music lessons where she has learnt to play the recorder, violin, keyboard and other musical instruments. During Gourmet Moments, she has learnt about food preparation, nutrition, and different cuisines, and is proud to bring home the dish she has prepared in school. My child has also been instilled moral values such as empathy, kindness and courtesy, and is able to care for others. We are heartened with her growth and development over the past four years and are confident that she will be well-prepared for primary school.",0.17150856389986827,Topic 5,"['teacher', 'school', 'child', 'kid', 'care', 'good', 'love', 'thank', 'parent', 'principal', 'staff', 'learn', 'son', 'daughter', 'year', 'environment', 'great', 'preschool', 'ms', 'experience']",MindChamps PreSchool @ Woodlands

"""We have had the pleasure of sending our child to MindChamps @ Brooks II since 1 year ago, and we couldn't be happier with the experience. The teachers at MindChamps are exceptional. Their dedication, patience, and genuine care for each child create a nurturing environment where kids thrive. They not only educate but also foster emotional development and social skills in a way that goes above and beyond our expectations. The curriculum is well-structured and engaging, tailored to meet the needs and interests of every child. We've been amazed at the progress our child has made, not just academically, but also in terms of creativity, independence, and confidence. The facilities are clean, safe, and thoughtfully designed. Communication with the staff is seamless. We've always felt welcome to ask questions, seek updates, or discuss any concerns we might have. The regular progress reports and parent-teacher meetings have been invaluable in understanding our child's development journey. Special events and activities are frequent, and it's evident that the staff put a lot of effort into making each one memorable, be it birthday celebrations, themed dress-up days, field trips, or holiday celebrations. The school's management also went above and beyond to create a touching video montage for my child on his birthday.

"As a parent, I have carefully reviewed all the comments. I must objectively state that this school indeed has many issues, and I do not recommend parents to enroll their children here. Firstly, there has been an excessively high turnover of teachers over the past two years. Except for a few senior staff members, the entire teaching staff leaves every year. Secondly, due to the frequent turnover of teachers, children have a very hard time adapting to the school. This has led parents to lose confidence in the school. In summary, this is not a trustworthy school, and in recent years, the school leadership has turned a blind eye to this. The teachers I have come into contact with who left were all highly professional and dedicated. I believe that if it weren't for the extremely poor working environment, no teacher would want to leave. It is evident that the school leadership is not very friendly to its staff, which has resulted in poor school management.",-0.059915654520917676,Topic 5,"['teacher', 'school', 'child', 'kid', 'care', 'good', 'love', 'thank', 'parent', 'principal', 'staff', 'learn', 'son', 'daughter', 'year', 'environment', 'great', 'preschool', 'ms', 'experience']",MindChamps PreSchool @ The Brooks II

"My boy started with TCC in Dec’20 to do ICCP in 2021. From little to no verbal speech and a very short attention span, in a short period of time he showed vast improvements in receptive language, and he was able to do the given worksheets. The teachers also gave him the appropriate support and encouragement when guiding him with his fine motor ie. penmanship and coloring. They conduct their lesson in a small group setting in K1 which benefits children with special needs (SN) or those who need more assistance in learning progressively. The school is very inclusive for children with SN and the other children in the school are also taught how to help their friends with challenges. No child is excluded from any school activities, performances, field trips or “camping” in school. For example, the teachers choreographed the graduation dance and taught my boy to dance in a way that he could manage, even getting classmates to support him in moving around during the dance. It is an incredible honor for my child to have the opportunity to experience being in a performance. I salute the teachers' spirit of never giving up on any child. Teachers are always open to listening and discussing with us how they can better support our boy. They even go the extra mile to get stickers and books of his interest to motivate and reward him. Aunties were so sweet as well - they would do takeaway fruits or afternoon tea breaks for items that he likes if we need to bring him home earlier. It was such a memorable experience for our boy to do a sleepover in school with his classmate before they graduate. He was even appointed to present the token of appreciation to the GOH during graduation. It is an incredible opportunity for him to be trusted with this responsibility. Under the leadership of Ms Candice, the children care community is like a big family. It is also so heartwarming that all the teachers are involved during the first in-person graduation since 2019.

The teachers at word learning centre are the very best and were paying attention to individual child and correcting them wherever needed! EVERY Teacher there is committed to student learning, growth & success. In order to encourage children, they used to reward children with token memento/ certificate etc. They inculcated diary writing, book reading, mental math so strongly that even now it has become a part of routine for my son. Besides studies, encouraging child to take participation in extracurricular activities like science models, art, craft, dance, public speaking etc. too was a part of developing children.

"The best decision we made when we enrolled our boy, Javen, at TWLC for his preschool education. Teachers were caring, nurturing and truly passionate in what they were doing. Every child was given opportunities to excel and realise his/her own potential. Curriculum was well-rounded, exposing the children to various domains like Science, Art, Music & Dance and Languages. The quarterly learning journeys were not only fun but enriching as well. Teachers were receptive to feedback and had an open communication with parents. We always felt at ease and welcomed to speak with the teachers whenever we had any concerns about Javen. When we moved house and were considering switching Javen out of TWLC so that we did not have to travel back to Woodlands, we faced difficulties in finding another school nearby which could match what TWLC could offer and with reasonable school fees. So we stayed on, despite having to travel further. That is how high the standard at TWLC is - it gives us the assurance that our children are in safe hands. Thanks to TWLC for laying a strong foundation, Javen had no problems transitioning to Primary School. He has consistently been performing well from P1 to P5. It has been five years since he graduated from TWLC, but the teachers and school remain close to our heart.

But throughout the course of a few months, I looked forward to going to school, the kindness of the teachers there had made me realize that there was no one that was going to swallow me whole there (I was actually afraid of the teachers). With some friends that I grew really close to, I believe that I had been properly nurtured to be who I am today. I am not only taught major subjects, but I’m also taught about values. Not just through lessons, but through friendships, experiences that I will never want to replace. I walked, or was carried in as an unknowledgeable, inexperienced and antisocial shy person.

"As a long-established private kindergarten in Singapore, PATS’s brand quality does not need to be elaborated. I chose pats sembawang country club campus mainly because of its following advantages: 1. Have your own outdoor activity area and the teachers do take the children outdoors on non-rainy days: at least 2 hours of outdoor activities a day are the best protection for children’s eyes, so I put outdoor conditions first when choosing a kindergarten. First consideration. As well as the school's own play facilities, the school also shares some facilities with the golf club, such as the swimming pool, and the children have two water days each month. 2. Rich extra-school activities: There are actually plenty of activities for children to learn and play in school, but the school also carefully arranges some out-of-school activities, such as taking the children to the stadium to experience football, playing with excavators, and experiencing Experiencing Chinese opera and so on allows children to learn, feel and experience in happiness. 3. Teacher-student ratio: Compared with the ratio of 1:10 or 1:14 in many government kindergartens, the teacher-student ratio of pats sembawang is smaller. In many classes, two teachers teach 10-12 children. In Doudou class, there may be two teachers. A teacher only takes care of six or seven children, which is undoubtedly a great advantage for taking care of children's emotions and helping them adapt to school life. 4. Teacher quality: From what I have observed in the six months since my daughter entered kindergarten, all the teachers and staff at pats sembawang are friendly, polite, and enthusiastic. Before I chose this school, I took my children to the school gate to see the school. I saw that the teacher carried the children out after school, and they were still very dependent on the teacher when they were separated. When I saw that, I felt that it was a blessing to meet such a teacher. I was very lucky. Later, after my daughter entered the kindergarten, I discovered that we were also lucky, because the teachers here really like the children and are really good to them, so the children will naturally like and rely on them. 5. Convenient pick-up and drop-off: Unlike schools in shopping malls, picking up children here does not require you to worry about lack of parking spaces or being stuck in the grace period when leaving the parking lot (if you do not have a private car, you can also choose the school’s school bus service). 6. Daily communication: Through the school APP, you can see the daily updates of the children at school. Although it is not as large as some teachers who set up groups to share continuously, I prefer this method and I prefer teachers to spend more time. Spend time with your kids instead of focusing on taking photos and videos and sending instant group messages. 7. Food: I have visited many schools. I feel that since I want to send my children to kindergarten, I really have to relax. Because of religious reasons, the school does not provide red meat (pork and beef), so I can only rely on the food at home. Dinner supplement. In addition, we have to give up controlling sugar and snacks. When the children get together, it is really freeing and they are really happy. 😬""",0.24312770562770555,Topic 5,"['teacher', 'school', 'child', 'kid', 'care', 'good', 'love', 'thank', 'parent', 'principal', 'staff', 'learn', 'son', 'daughter', 'year', 'environment', 'great', 'preschool', 'ms', 'experience']",The Schoolhouse by Busy Bees (Sembawang Country Club)

"I just moved my child out of Pats Katong branch to another new childcare in 2022. Massive disappointment of our experiences at Katong branch. My child had been with pats schoolhouse from start, past experiences with Pats Shaer (now defunct) and Pats Sembawang was fantastic with great teachers, principals, and environment where they really care for your kids. In Pats Katong branch, experiences was drastically different. -Messy hair of child when return from school -No dry of child’s hair after water play till end of the day. -Child say food given not enough, still hungry. (Apparently quantity is limited as food delivered from Katong 1 to Katong 2) -Rashes due to not cleaning up well after toilet use and teacher just looking at her outside the toilet, even when child asked for help. -Child progress updates on app by K1 teacher was just for the sake of doing, posting general pictures, no additional comments of child progress. -Whole classroom looking at video from a small monitor??? (see pic) Even smaller than my home monitor screen. Some of the above points, I still can brush it away, as might be 5 year old saying wrong things, lack of preschool teachers, lockdown, branch too big etc  But the final straw is really the poor communication of confirmed covid cases in same class. Thou they mentioned it was as per MOH protocol of 2 days after report then school will announce (I dun understand rational of this). As school did not communicate promptly, eventually is parents communicating between each other then we are aware of the situation. Worse still, entire class gotten HRN from MOH, even thou most kids DID NOT attend school most of that week. By just simply looking at check-in records, school will know exactly whom attended school but I guess admin dun even bother to check and just submit entire list to MOH. Anyway, child is happy in new childcare and instantly we can see the drastic differences in the new childcare, communication, enrolment procedures, hygiene taken when entering school etc..

I missed the old loving and caring environment when Ms Julianna and Ms Jiahui were still here. They were reasonable, caring and considerate.

"""During our relocation to Singapore, one of the most important things for us to get settled was choosing the most ideal school for our then 2.5-year-old daughter. My husband and I did countless hours of research, and I personally visited 13 different schools, and sat down with 13 different principals to understand the learning tools/ structure, and core values of each school. It wasn't until I met Natalie from Pat's Buckley that my husband and I both knew we had found the right school. Natalie was professional, personable, caring, welcoming, and very engaging.  We were also very pleased with the tour provided by Miss Gen at the time. I'm especially pleased that both Natalie and Miss Gen are receptive to parental feedback. It's so easy to see that they are dedicated in the improvement of the school's learning environment. My child’s transition to a new school in a new country was made easier under the guidance of her teachers miss Jae and Liu Laoshi. She participated in a variety of activities and events and enjoyed both her teachers and classmates. Liu Laoshi has a vibrant personality, always smiling and ready to assist.  Miss Jae is extremely caring, kind, and helpful. She is also genuinely concerned about my child’s well-being in school and always takes her time to keep me updated whenever I see her during school pick up and drop off.  My child continued to grow over the years under the patient care and guidance of Miss Jae, Miss Kristie, Guo Laoshi, and Xu Laoshi. It's especially heartwarming to see my child constantly singing and dancing to the songs that she's learnt at school from her music lessons with Miss Eunice. Fast forward a few years, my older child has graduated, and my younger child is now also attending Pat’s and loving school under the care of her teachers Miss Tina and Sun Laoshi. Every day my child is always happy to go to school and full of smiles when I pick her up. As a parent, I feel extremely grateful to be part of an institution where the leadership team and the teachers focus on the well-rounded development of a child. The current Principal Miss Gen’s warm and compassionate demeanor radiates throughout the entire school, creating an environment of kindness and respect. The teachers are equally amazing. They are passionate about teaching and care deeply about the well-being and development of every child. Their creativity and enthusiasm shine through in every activity and lesson. They have a genuine love for their students, and it shows in the way they interact with them. My family loves seeing the high level of care from the teachers, and we are grateful for the new and close friendships we've also created with some of the parents. I cannot thank the staff at Pat’s Schoolhouse Buckley enough for the incredible care, love, and education they have provided for my two kids.  Not only have they learned academic skills, but they have also developed social and emotional skills that will serve well in life. I highly recommend Pat’s Buckley to any parent looking for a safe, nurturing, and high-quality preschool.

"I have very good 2 yrs+ experience at Orange Tree Preschool and it was a pity when I have to relocate and change school this year. My kids love the school, the teachers and their friends. They always look forward to going to school. Ms Hema who is the principal cares a lot for the kids and she can remember all their names. She always smiles warmly to receive the kids and waves goodbye fondly when she sends them home. I think all the parents can really see the passion that she has for this job. And if I have any concerns, I feel comfortable to communicate it with her and she will help to address them. The admins in the school are also very nice and provide me with good support. I remembered when my 3 YO first entered school into Nursery One. She cried for the first week. Ms Hema and 赵老师 were there to hug and console her and then she settled down pretty fast. After one week she was no longer crying. It was really heartwarming that my girl could look towards the principal and her form teacher for comfort. And the fact that she settled down after their hugs mean she trust them as well. 赵老师 was very patient with my girl and also helped my girl to overcome her food chewing problem. I really appreciate the patience and concern that 赵老师 put in. 赵老师 is really a dedicated and responsible teacher. There were a lot of effort that she put in on my girl during her preschool stay to help her learning. My girl always told me at home that she loves 赵老师. Even now when she is in a different preschool, she says she misses 赵老师, Teacher Rachel and her friends. Then my boy also entered PGC and we found another gem teacher 曾老师. She was good to my boy and really care a lot for him. She will give me constant updates about him. Overall I think OrangeTree is a good preschool and their environment is good for the kids. They do 2:3 days of chinese and english respectively and alternate every week. Their enrichment classes and school outings are also affordable.

"Both my kids were in OTP and it has been a wonderful learning experience for the kids. They get a lot of care and attention, and are kept stimulated with fun, creative learning activities and regular outdoor time (there’s a pool in the outdoor area even). The teachers are all approachable and caring. The curriculum is well structured with both English and Chinese languages, which expose my kids into variety of activities that develop all kinds of skills they need. The enrichment classes are at reasonable price, I can tell the improvement since my daughter started her Speech and Drama class about a year ago. She also enjoyed her Arts classes and brought back beautiful art pieces. The communication with the school and teachers is also good. The APP regularly updates the activities of the kids (with photos) which let the parents have the sense of what the kids are playing at school. Announcement are also timely updated through the APP as well. Furthermore, when my kids were absent due to illness, the teachers always call me during their lunch break to check on the kids condition, and they also call to update me whenever there’s minor injuries in school (e.g minor scratches due to kids playing). The principal is supper attentive too, fast response in WhatsApp message, and super accommodating when I request to extend school for another week after the withdrawal process is done. Overall I am very happy with Orange Tree Preschool and I felt lucky to pick this school 3 years ago after comparing a few centres in BP area. Now due to house moving, I have to transfer my kids to other childcares. It’s really a heart pain decision, I can’t find the similar type of school at the same fee range anymore.

"Poor environment, teachers mostly are lack of patience due to less man power. 1980s style of communication with hand writing on a so call com-book! Not allow to communicate with teachers directly. All matters need to go through principle, yet principle knows nothing at all. No covered pick up area, children always get all wet if raining. Poor arrangement of sending in children every morning, due to less of communication, every parent wants to talk to teachers which makes the flow of sending children in to stuck! especially during COVID period, 15-20 parents and children in a 2 sq meter area for sometimes 15-20mins, not safe at all. Food is terrible, properly all students sharing 300g meat. Principle is arrogant, always blaming on children own problems. Nothing need be improved from school side. Teachers always change due to limited manpower, no one actually can understand children’s real status. Likely we left this school after 6 months bad experience. Once we confirmed to leave, child sleeves were wet almost everyday. Ask him to go toilet by himself, pants were never been worn properly! Ask principle to let teachers ask kid to drink more water due to ulcer, principle response: “you can choose not to send him in” Not recommend at all. Principle’s Attitude decides teacher’s attitude, which may makes the whole environment horrible.

"The preschool provides holistic curriculum which has honed my 2 children with adequate life skills & set strong language (English and Chinese) foundations to prepare them for a smoother transition into primary one. (My eldest is now in P3 and youngest is now in K2. Both joined when they were in PG) The class conducts structured lessons where my children are introduced to a thematic range of learning concepts from family to traffic to food etc. Mathematical and scientific knowledge are also included in their program through indoor experiments and outdoor exploration, where my 2 kids can pick up relevant skills from there. Teacher-parent communication is also very proactive through messaging & communication book, despite the inconvenience posed during covid period. The safety concern of the school kids in the compound are one of their priorities too, so I am assured that my kids are in trusted hands from drop off to fetching.

"My Child was badly scratched, bruised, and bitten on THREE occasions within SIX MONTHS in this Childcare. The teachers and principal did nothing to prevent bullying from happening in their childcare. They show nonchalant attitude towards all injuries during school hours, brushing it off by saying it is inevitable that such incidents happen. Incident 1: My daughter's face was badly scratched by a boy from the same class. Teacher's excuse: The boy was undergoing mood swing therefore it happen. Incident 2: My daughter's hand was bitten by a girl from the same class. There are visible wounds with bite marks on her hand. Teacher's excuse was that they are just playing and such incidents are inevitable. My daughter said she was pushed and bitten and called for help but her teachers did not stop the girl from biting her. Incident 3: My daughter's face was again badly scratched and bruised with 3 visible wounds. Incident happened between 4pm to 5pm. Teacher again did not call to inform. Their excuse: Since parents is fetching them soon, they do not see the need to call to inform. (I fetch my daughter at 6pm). To the principal Ms Sylvia, if you are reading this: Please establish a clear set of process and conduct for your teachers to follow. It is no coincidence that your childcare had so many cases of child injuries under your management. To all potential parents: Do re-consider enrolling your child into this childcare centre. I am happy to provide evidence and proof for everything I have written above. Update Feb-2023: I have transferred my daughter to another childcare and can see a big difference in the care and attention provided by teachers and staff in her new childcare.

"""Placed my child on the school’s ECDA waitlist as well as contacted the school personally. I was informed via email that vacancy priority will go to the children of Temasek Polytechnic’s staff which I fully concurred with, seeing that this school is located in the school‘s premise itself. Was told to fill up a form to be placed on the waitlist which I did, and there were no other exchange of emails. I emailed the school about 6 weeks later in the afternoon just to check roughly how many children are ahead of my boy in the waitlist, so as to have a better sense of whether I should continue waiting or perhaps commit to another school further away. Approximately one hour after sending the email, my husband forwarded to me a message notification stating that my child’s interest in little skool house at TP has been removed by the centre citing no vacancy. Naturally, I was appalled and was wondering what are the odds of this being a mere coincidence? I went back to my email wondering whether I have missed out any emails but nope, nothing was sent to me. I called the school and the principal Ivy answered. She told me it was a mere coincidence and that she herself was the one who amended the ECDA list and removed him. And I was told not to worry, as despite the fact that she personally removed him from the wait list, my child remained on their personal wait list and that once again, priority goes to TP staff but they’ll contact me again if there is any vacancies. This baffles me completely because it’s as good as telling me that HDB has removed us from the ballot list for a BTO house, but not to worry as they have a private list which we are supposedly still on. I told the principal that it was a very simple question. We are all adults here. Even if you can’t answer due to privacy issues, there is no need to be so passive aggressive in your action. Say I buy your story that it was sheer coincidence. Can you tell me roughly where my child is on the waitlist? And as usual, I was reiterated that TP’s staff have priority, that she despite being the principal can’t give me an answer unless she opens another class, that she can’t reveal or say anything. I was disappointed nonetheless and hanged up the phone. After which I received 3 missed calls and an email from an admin stating that she will be on leave the next day and that she will contact me via email the following day. I responded to that email citing that a waitlist only serves to exist purely because there is no vacancy in the school isn’t it? Why remove my child from the waitlist after asking us to fill up a form to join the waitlist and then cite “no vacancy” as your reason for removal. Have all the other kids born in 2021 also been personally removed from your ECDA’s wait list (but still remained on your private wait list then)? Does it even make sense? And not surprisingly, I did not receive any email replies to my question following the staff’s one day leave. With such staffs, poor communication and questionable principal overlooking the school, there is no way I would ever trust my child to be left in their hands. Such passive aggressive action shouldn’t be coming from a preschool principal herself in a setting where I’m supposed to entrust that my child is going to be taught good values and virtues at. I won’t even go so far as to recommend this school to my enemy’s children. Should issues arise down the road, as a parent who am I supposed to turn to? Edited: I finally received an email reply from the school today (7 days later). On the evening of the morning that I posted this review. Sheer coincidence again?

Approximately six months ago, I initiated the process of scheduling a school visit and enrolling my child in your school through your official website. Unfortunately, my interactions with your staff have left me deeply disappointed. Upon following your institution’s instructions to book a visit through your website, I submitted numerous emails and online appointment requests, but to my dismay, I received no response whatsoever. This lack of communication and engagement with prospective parents is unacceptable and has caused significant frustration. Furthermore, when I made a phone call to your institution to seek clarification and confirmation, I was met with an impatient and discourteous attitude. I was informed in a rather dismissive manner that the school had reached its maximum capacity and was no longer accepting new students. To make matters worse, the staff member I was speaking with abruptly ended the call when I attempted to seek further clarification. While I understand that your school may be in high demand, it is essential to treat all prospective parents with respect and provide them with a response, whether or not enrollment slots are available. Failing to do so is a disservice to parents who are genuinely interested in your school and willing to invest their time and effort in the application process.

"""I appreciate the quality of care, passion and education provided by Ms Katherine (principal) and the teachers. They do not solely focus on academic, they are also concern about the psychological development and social skills of our children. The children get to learn individually at their own pace and became more independent, patient and confident under the care of the school. They also love the excursions, geography lessons, cooking sessions and science experiments that are organised with great effort and care. Both my girls (7 & 10 yr old) still request to visit the school even after graduation which shows how much they have enjoyed their time there. Special thanks to Ms Katherine and her team for creating such wonderful learning experience for them.",0.31120448179271715,Topic 5,"['teacher', 'school', 'child', 'kid', 'care', 'good', 'love', 'thank', 'parent', 'principal', 'staff', 'learn', 'son', 'daughter', 'year', 'environment', 'great', 'preschool', 'ms', 'experience']",The Little House (Montessori)
"TLH is an outstanding preschool! I highly recommend it. The principal (Mrs. Katherine) is also the founder and owner of the school. This means that she has final say of how to run the school and sees ideas thru to implementation. It is extremely valuable to have consistent leadership. She anchors and ensures that the school is run up to her high standards and principles, and based on sound research of what is best for children. The children are taught to be socially aware, responsible and considerate. These and other good habits are inculcated from day one resulting in the school having a calm and cheerful atmosphere. It’s like a home away from home. The school motto is “help me help myself”. There is a focus on confidence and initiative in the context of community. Mrs. Katherine is the model of a skilled and confident person. What better way to teach confidence than to exemplify it authentically! The teachers she selects are of high quality and quite a few have been at the school for many years. This means it’s a stable environment for the children. My child often tells me how much he loves interacting with his teachers. It is a language-rich environment and I have never heard the teachers speak bad English or Mandarin. This is a mixed age Montessori school. Older children are paired with younger ones and the kids learn social graces within community, not simply in theory. Older ones learn patience, leadership and kindness towards younger ones. Younger ones experience this and have confidence that one day they can in turn be in that role, rather than all children waiting on adults to serve them. All kids learn that they are active, useful and integral parts of their community thru everyday interactions. When I went for the school tour a few years ago, I was really caught off guard by 4 children coming up to me to see if I wanted a drink. They were going to pour water for me and host me! It is a true testimony as to how TLH respects children as individuals, believes in their abilities, and empowers them, to the point that the children were not unduly afraid of me, and saw it as their responsibility to host me, the guest in their school. I had visited 10 schools before deciding on this one and even my 1st runner up school is a far cry from what happened during my tour here. The other schools basically told the children to not disturb the adult talking with the principal and go do their own thing. Whereas at TLH, while no one interrupted the conversation, the children were instead encouraged to step up. They are not treated like a distraction to the “real work” that only adults do, but they are empowered to play key roles in the “real work”. Imagine the feeling of accomplishment and personal value they feel, and how eager they would be to step up and take initiative again! It shows me how the teachers view the children and their abilities, and natural opportunities that can be seized to build the kids up. To me, these are very well trained and intelligent teachers, and I would be safe to partner with them for my child’s learning journey. There is an individualised learning plan for each child. Academic lessons like math and reading are done 1-1. The fast learner does not have to sit in a bored classroom learning what he already knows. The slower learner does not have to feel shame and be discouraged to try their best. The kids abilities are intimately known by teachers because of this 1-1 interaction. There is cooking every week where the children themselves get to cook! One of life's greatest sensorial experience. And they learn counting, fractions, mass and volume, chemical reactions, new vocabulary and all that academic stuff without even realizing it. Montessori schools are meant to be so much more than just Maria Montessori's materials. It is the entire ethos and community life, seeing thru children’s eyes and respecting them as valuable individuals. TLH is a Montessori par excellence.",0.18319175360158965,Topic 5,"['teacher', 'school', 'child', 'kid', 'care', 'good', 'love', 'thank', 'parent', 'principal', 'staff', 'learn', 'son', 'daughter', 'year', 'environment', 'great', 'preschool', 'ms', 'experience']",The Little House (Montessori)

"Our girl joined The Little House's playgroup when she was only 1.5 years old. I was ready for a month of transition given the young age, but she adopted very quickly in merely a week. Not only the teachers have a wealth of experiences, they are organized and paid much attention to children's reaction and development. Thanks to that, we could pivot our approach of education in timely manner and it had help our daughter tremendously. The teachers also took initiative and let us know that our daughter had shown signs that she was ready for toilet training. It is fascinating and reassuring that the teachers are attentive to the kids, dare I say more so than the parents given that we are 2 working parents... I found overall the children of The Little House to be confident, well-mannered, gentle and creative. The Montessori approach was instilled not just through the tools, facility, or the program - it lives in their daily interaction with the kids.

"The Little House Montessori is the best environment we could possibly have found for our daughters. Our eldest joined when we arrived in Singapore and took all of 20 minutes to settle in. The environment, the teachers and the other students all form a virtuous circle in which our daughter has become responsible, curious, caring of others and brave in voicing her opinion and exploring new things.

"When we moved to Singapore three years ago, we visited about 15 preschools before we chose the Little House Montessori for our eldest child. We are absolutely thrilled with our choice, and this year, our younger child also started at TLHM. Each child has an individualised education plan, and the teachers are very tuned in to the needs and progress of every child. With their decades of combined experience, they provide a lot of support and advice around any developmental and behavioural issues that your child may face. Our children love the geography lessons, the science experiments, the weekly cooking, the play-based learning, and the structure they get at school. As parents, we love the wholesome (bilingual) environment, the wonderfully diverse student group, the excellent team of teachers and staff, and the inclusive community, all ably held together and led by the head directress, Mrs. Katherine. I especially appreciate the emphasis on good manners, the practical lessons in independence, the focus on the children’s physical development, and the language support given for non-native Mandarin speakers. This is an incredible place for children to spend their early formative years, and I highly recommend the Little House Montessori to anyone who wants to inculcate confidence and a love of learning in their child.",0.3602777777777778,Topic 5,"['teacher', 'school', 'child', 'kid', 'care', 'good', 'love', 'thank', 'parent', 'principal', 'staff', 'learn', 'son', 'daughter', 'year', 'environment', 'great', 'preschool', 'ms', 'experience']",The Little House (Montessori)
"Our first Son started with the Little House at the age of 18 months. After visiting more than 15 schools, it didn't take much thinking to decide on this one. The teachers are hands-on with all the kids and the older children in the school are all well mannered and courteous (a sign they must be doing things quite well). In proper Montessori style, they teach independence, value of community, behavior and life skills (the cooking every Thursday is the highlight for us). They keep the parents updated through regular newsletters, videos, photos about what the kids are learning during the day.

"If you're looking for a Montessori that has the best of everything - the classical Montessori environment and practices, a strong focus on the three Rs, a fun and energetic vibe, and more - The Little House Montessori is IT. What I loved the most was that they place a lot of importance on inculcating social graces and thoughtfulness in the children - saying please and thank you, forming and expressing their opinions politely yet effectively, taking turns, being fair, and so on. Children learn so much more than regular classroom stuff - cleaning their own plates and bowls after lunch, using various tools safely (such as scissors, punch machines, staplers, even the binding machine), cooking (and they share all the recipes with us at the end of the year!). The best part is how confident it makes the kids - all Little House kids I've met have this ""can-do"" attitude about everything. Every week, they conduct Science experiments (and they deal with serious stuff: density, buoyancy, condensation...) and teach Geography (they tell the kids about a new country and what's really special about it). Special mention must be made about Mandarin. My daughter joined TLH mid-year in N2, when we had just moved to Singapore. I was quite apprehensive about her having to deal with learning a new language along with everything else that was so new for her. Imagine my surprise (and relief!) when she soon started crooning in Mandarin! When I ask her who her favourite teacher is, most often she names Mandarin teacher that she names. Just to give an idea of how dedicated they are, during the first phase of the circuit breaker, the Mandarin teacher made detailed videos of writing and pronouncing each of the Chinese characters the kids needed to practise, which were so easy even for someone like me, with no knowledge of the language, to follow. And the teachers are truly so, SO caring. I have personally witnessed how lovingly they handle very young kids who are anxious about leaving their mums to go off alone to school. There have been kids who have screamed and cried for the better part of a term or more, but the teachers would handle the situation with seemingly effortless calm. They're also an inclusive school; there have been kids with special needs, who join in the fun with everyone else, including the year-end concert. I could go on and on. Long story short, though; if you're looking for a great school, Montessori or otherwise, for your 1.5 - 6 year old, you really must pay The Little House Montessori a visit.",0.2878563194052325,Topic 5,"['teacher', 'school', 'child', 'kid', 'care', 'good', 'love', 'thank', 'parent', 'principal', 'staff', 'learn', 'son', 'daughter', 'year', 'environment', 'great', 'preschool', 'ms', 'experience']",The Little House (Montessori)
"To the best of my observations, I notice some positive changes on my children, throughout their pre school development. 1. Bahavioral development.

They express and they control it. 3. Self-initiative. They are becoming independent in a way they learn to manage things themselves. Learnt to reduce redundancy and becoming much reliable.

"This was the first kindergarten I viewed after we moved to sunset area. I stepped in an old fashion glass door and got a warm welcome from Mrs Katherine. She enthusiastically walked me around while introducing how the classes would be carried out etc. We walked to the outdoor area, kids were happily playing in the small garden. There came a little girl, she saw me and came close to me. Before I realised, she poured me a glass of water from their snack station, where I saw a tray with couple of glasses stacking up, a jar of water and bananas neatly laying on top of it. That was it. I cancelled all appointments with other kindergarten and enrolled my boy. My boy was then 4yr8month, he enjoyed going to TLH so much. Every week he told me a new science experiment; a new country with either its language or food; a new role-play with manner; oh yeah, a new goodie he made under the instruction of teachers. I was very impressed. The teachers made it all seemed so effortless, yet meaningful. I remembered those days, parents gathered outside of the glass door where the kids lined up and got checked before going in school. Teachers welcomed kids with the brightest smile and funny talks. Mrs Katherine stood at her most comfy tree pose and chatted with us, we all started our days with lots of joy and laughter. Of course, most importantly, we knew our kids would have a wonderful school day at TLH. How can I not mention the year end concert? It was fascinating. Nothing fancy but full of love and warmth. Teachers and kids designed their own stage, no one needed to wear special clothes or make-up. Kids chose what they most comfortable with and what they want to perform. They gave it their best on the stage. It was a pure joy for parents to see the how much their confidence have grown over a year. 2020, the pandemic hit. Teachers in TLH managed to gather all students single performing clips and created a long video. It was heartfelt. Still it seemed so effortless but meaningful. We strongly recommend The Little House Montessori. It was the best decision to enrol our boy there. Everyday in his primary school life has benefitted greatly from his experience at TLH.

"I would like to extend my thanks to Mrs Katherine Sebastian of the Little House (Montessori) and her team of teachers for having done a good job of bringing up my two little ones, Zhi Rong and Jia Ning. I first chose this school, because, during the student visit, I was struck by the fact that the children were going about their studies, calmly and in an orderly manner, without any teacher screaming or raising their voice. Both kids attended 4 years of kindy and nursery education. I am happy with the academic standards of The Little House (Montessori) as they prepare the child for up to primary 2 level of studies Zhi Rong has been doing well in Primary one and two, in Pei Hwa Presbyterian. I am very appreciative of the close supervision and extra care the teachers took to look after my younger daughter. She was initially difficult and reluctant to learn. However, the teachers took the time to suss her out and managed to patiently coax her to apply herself, resulting in her catching up by the time she graduated from K2. We are confident she will not find primary one a struggle Teachers do give feedback to parents on how their kids are doing, and work hand in hand with parents for the betterment of the children. I especially appreciate the occasional talks given by teachers and Mrs Katherine, on how the school teaches their mathematics and English Language. They even hold small get together talks on “How to get your children to behave the TLH way” (You must attend this one!!) Teacher turnover is low in this school, which helps the children feel they are in a safe and stable environment. I understand the school even sponsors teachers for higher learning! If I had a third child, I would not hesitate to send him or her to this school. The teachers are dedicated, professional, knowledgeable. The principal is serious about educating the children and maintaining standards. More than once, I asked her about expanding her school but she won’t do it if it compromises the standards set. A big thank you to Mrs Katherine Sebastian and the team that make up The Little House (Montessori). You helped to bring up my two kids.

"The Little House was a home away from home to both my children (now aged 9 and 7, and in the Singapore school system). They spent their preschool years playing and learning in the wonderfully creative and nurturing environment of TLH, created by Katherine and her amazing staff of teachers. From rigorous Mandarin, Math and English, to cooking, dancing, plays, games, unbelievably fun school bus rides and more, TLH played a huge role in their development, instilling confidence, empathy and resilience that will hopefully last them for many years to come. As a University educator myself, I cannot speak more highly of the learning environment at TLH - it is indeed a model that I sometimes wish we had the chance to follow even in tertiary education! I am eternally grateful to TLH for playing such a big role in my children’s early lives, and cannot recommend it highly enough!",0.18897058823529417,Topic 5,"['teacher', 'school', 'child', 'kid', 'care', 'good', 'love', 'thank', 'parent', 'principal', 'staff', 'learn', 'son', 'daughter', 'year', 'environment', 'great', 'preschool', 'ms', 'experience']",The Little House (Montessori)
"TLH review A truly special place with heart, soul and an extraordinary crew of teachers! I visited a number of pre-schools while searching for a school for my first born and stopped searching the moment I visited TLH. It’s amazing how organised the school is; everyone seems to know exactly where to go and what to do at any point in time. Mrs Katherine runs a tight (and extremely effective) ship at TLH - clearly a woman on a mission! Things I love about TLH: - I love how the children are treated with respect, allowed to be responsible for themselves and others from a young age. They are encouraged to be individuals with unique personalities, strengths and weaknesses. There is no rote learning in this school; every child gets to play, explore and learn at their own pace. They’re taught to be respectful of mother nature and to be kind and empathic towards the needy. - I love how my kids come home happy every day, with tales of how they’ve enjoyed learning about different countries and cultures from geography class, working with magnets during science class, singing about planets and continents at circle time, baking and cooking on Thursdays and most of all, fun times with their friends at the sandpit during outdoor play. - The birthday celebrations I’ve attended at TLH are some of the most meaningful celebrations I’ve ever been to. Instead of focusing the celebration around singing the obligatory “happy birthday” song and cake cutting, the teachers takes time to talk about the birthday child, from the time the child is in his mother’s womb to his milestones and achievements over the years, and the number of times the child has orbited around the sun. - I love how the annual year-end concert is organised as an intimate affair which prioritises the child’s learning process over the end product. No sleek venues, costly costumes or over-rehearsed performers. Instead, every child get to contribute, from creating the backdrop and props to choosing the item they’d like to perform. My younger child has recently started attending TLH as well, shortly after his 2nd birthday. I’m pleased to see how quickly he has adapted to the new environment and how he has grown in confidence, social and physical awareness since starting school at TLH.",0.29732285258601054,Topic 5,"['teacher', 'school', 'child', 'kid', 'care', 'good', 'love', 'thank', 'parent', 'principal', 'staff', 'learn', 'son', 'daughter', 'year', 'environment', 'great', 'preschool', 'ms', 'experience']",The Little House (Montessori)
"Our daughter has attended two other pre-schools prior to The Little House, so we can confidently say that this place is truly special. It is a tight-knit community of outstandingly committed teachers with very low turnover (a problem at many other pre-schools!) and a lovely multicultural mix of students. We also love the school's premises - an airy main room with open doors and windows to the garden and playground, as well as dedicated areas for various purposes. We did not choose this school specifically for the Montessori method, but after witnessing this unique and extremely effective approach to learning we are convinced that this is one of the best ways to build a strong foundation and guide young children into the world of reading, writing and understanding numbers. Every child receives one-to-one attention and is allowed to learn at his or her individual pace. At this school, learning is made fun which in our opinion is the best gift you could give to your child. As a result, we are extremely confident that our daughter will have no problems whatsoever with the transition to primary school. In fact, her reading, writing and maths skills are above average for her age. Another strength of the school is the Mandarin programme which is conducted by native Chinese teachers. We have been thoroughly impressed with the advanced level of our daughter's Mandarin which she picked up solely at this school. The reason why I am emphasizing all these is not because I am overly concerned with her academic performance (not at this young age anyway), but because I have heard some other parents being worried about whether a pre-school with such strong Montessori philosophy would be a good preparation for local primary school. The answer is absolutely yes! In fact, Singapore needs many more schools like Little House! The curricular activities are rounded off by attention to character development and conveying a strong sense of community and teamwork to the children. Then there are the many wonderful traditions at the school that we have come to cherish over the years - the birthday walk, show & tell, Thursday's cooking class, the yearly Deepavali field trip to Little India (amongst many other regular field trips) and many more. We are fortunate to have discovered Little House, a true gem in the Sunset Way neighbourhood, and are already looking forward to enroll our second child in the 2017 intake.",0.2726052689594356,Topic 5,"['teacher', 'school', 'child', 'kid', 'care', 'good', 'love', 'thank', 'parent', 'principal', 'staff', 'learn', 'son', 'daughter', 'year', 'environment', 'great', 'preschool', 'ms', 'experience']",The Little House (Montessori)
"We wish we had found this place sooner! We moved our son to TLH in June 2016 during his K1 year after his previous school shut down and it has been an amazing journey for him and for us as parents since he started here. Despite his difficulty with adapting to change, our son transitioned to TLH with remarkable ease, owed largely due to the creative teaching methods TLH uses. Their teachers put in a lot of effort into tailoring the curriculum to each child's individual learning capability. In under a year, our mostly English and partly Hindi speaking son was conversing fluently enough in Mandarin to defend himself if accused of a misdemeanor! The day is a good mix of dual language teaching and playtime, and the weekly sash races and cooking sessions were quite a highlight for our son. One of the things that makes TLH unique is their headmistress Katherine. Kind, funny and incredibly good at running this school, she has a wonderful way with the children and brings together children, teachers and parents alike to develop a wonderful community atmosphere.

"All my three children went to The Little House (Montessori), and we all love and miss it so much! Years after entering primary school, my children’s best friends are from TLH, and several of the families have become family friends. TLH is a true-blue Montessori school that focuses on all aspects of a child’s development: physical, intellectual, language, emotional and social. Each of my children received the attention they needed in the areas where they needed it. Eg. Child no. 1 had to learn to deal better with setbacks, and not lose her temper. Child no.2 needed speech therapy because she was not correcting her mispronunciations even with extra help. Child no. 3 had to learn to share with peers and take turns graciously. Chinese is an organic part of TLH. My children came home talking about a dessert they had sampled from ""墨西哥"" (Mexico), talking about a science experiment that 马老师 had shown them as well as an obstacle course where they had to 爬过桥 (climb over the bridge). Learning to read was so effortless I did not hear about it, until they started pointing out random words they could recognise on billboards or tv subtitles: “Mummy, that is “来”, that is ""我""!"" All three of my children were able to transition easily into primary school. Academically, they were at or above the standard required for primary one. But more importantly, each child took responsibility for their own learning, and took pride in their work. Even when tired and frustrated, each child took pains to finish their work to the best of their ability. Child no. 1 cried as she struggled to finish her math homework, but she stuck it out, working out each answer without guessing. Child no. 3 whined when he to re-write several words in the dreaded Stellar handwriting workbook, but a simple, ""what would your current teacher/Ms Katherine/Kristine/Mrs Jo say?"", were enough to spur him on. Child no. 2 continues to finish her homework independently, something she had done since P1. Socially and emotionally, each child was able to make the leap from a warm, cosy and loving preschool to the much larger and anonymizing primary school. They were confident in managing all the different tasks: making new friends, choosing and buying food from the canteen, being part of a large class of 30 silently copying information from the white board. My oldest is now in secondary school, and continues to blossom, I’m sure in part due to the 3.5 formative years she spent in TLH where she learnt positive habits of independence/self-help, care for others, responsibility and self-discipline. She is able to whip up a delicious meal for the entire family plus guests, due to the love of cooking she developed in TLH. (The weekly Thursday cooking lessons at TLH are legendary! Parents of multiple children look forward to certain dishes, in particular, the chocolate truffle!) TLH feels like a family. There is very low staff turnover. Many of the teachers taught all three of my children, and my children always look forward to going back for visits. Mrs Katherine Sebastian has created a preschool that combines fun with responsibility, love with discipline, bound together with a lot of warmth and friendship.",0.2067390942390942,Topic 5,"['teacher', 'school', 'child', 'kid', 'care', 'good', 'love', 'thank', 'parent', 'principal', 'staff', 'learn', 'son', 'daughter', 'year', 'environment', 'great', 'preschool', 'ms', 'experience']",The Little House (Montessori)
"My Daughter started at TLH when she was 2.5 years old. It was only by pure luck that I found the school (like most foreigners, I left the school application to the very last minute) and managed to secure the last slot. I feel very blessed that my Daughter had many happy years at TLH. At that time she was going through potty training and unlike most children, she was not embarrassed or uncomfortable with having ""accidents"" at school all the time. The Teachers were so fantastic in helping me with her pottty training and not once did they complain or grumble. I don't know any school that could be more caring and patient with my child. The children at TLH are guided to be independent and taught how to use a scissors correctly at a young age. And under supervision, they are taught cooking and the safe way to use a small knife or peeler. My Daughter is now 5 and she constantly helps out with the dinner preparation at home. Thanks to TLH she knows how to use these sharp objects safely and correctly. Each child progresses at their own pace so their is no pressure to keep up with someone else. They are taught such a wide range of subjects such as language, reading, Maths, science, cooking and geography. And all this is done in a fun and relaxed way that is easy for a child to understand. I cannot count the number of times I am pleasantly surprised when my Daughter comes home with knowledge such as being able to name all the continents or telling me all about Pluto, the dwarf planet! My Daughter learnt more Chinese at TLH than she did at an external enrichment centre. And later on when I engaged a private Chinese tutor for her, it was TLH that helped me find her. I find that the Teachers are always accessible and ready to help with any issues that I have. They have a good library of resources that enable me to guide my child at home with her studies. Even when I have questions about non-school related issues such as Behavioural problems, they are always willing to listen and guide me. My Daughter has unfortunately moved on to a good international school a couple of months ago. I didn't have a choice as she was offered a place and both my Husband and I are not locals. Because of the high standards at TLH, her writing, reading and Maths level surpassed that of other children in her class. In fact, she often has to help her classmates with their writing. I'm not sure if it's pure chance or if TLH is selective but I have not met a parent at TLH that I do not like. All the parents are very friendly and supportive, and I have made some very dear friends during my daughters time there. Most importantly, TLH has molded my Daughter into a wonderful person. Through TLH, she has learnt to say please and thank you. She learnt to say excuse me and wait her turn to speak. She learnt that smoking is bad. She learnt to be polite and gracious. These are only a fe of the examples amongst many more. I can spot a TLH child at a party. All the TLH children are polite and wait for their turn to have a slice of cake. TLH children do not poke the birthday party or demand their share. In fact, because she is taught to do so at TLH, my Daughter always serves everyone before she has her slice of cake. To summarise, TLH, as locals would say, ""spoil market only"". TLH is so great that no other school compares to it, not even close. Note: TLH has a fantastic catered lunch too, with healthy yet delicious options and the Teachers were very kind to help me keep track of how much my child ate.",0.22574149659863943,Topic 5,"['teacher', 'school', 'child', 'kid', 'care', 'good', 'love', 'thank', 'parent', 'principal', 'staff', 'learn', 'son', 'daughter', 'year', 'environment', 'great', 'preschool', 'ms', 'experience']",The Little House (Montessori)

"We sent our daughter here for four years and we would unhesitatingly recommend it to any parent looking for a superb, well-balanced environment for their children. The staff are truly well-trained, and genuinely warm and caring. With the Montessori method, the children are given individual attention and learn at their own pace in a fun environment. The method ensures that each concept is firmly grasped before the child moves onto the next topic -- nothing is forced onto the child before he/she is ready. I was impressed with the high standards of Mandarin taught and as far as math, reading and writing are concerned, I have no doubt my child will breeze through most of Primary 1. The children are not coddled; they're encouraged to be curious, to figure things out themselves, and to ask if they have questions. Children are introduced to different countries and cultures. They learn to cook little dishes. They build confidence with their weekly show-and-tells, and the open mic at the year-end concerts. If there are playground arguments, they are taught to express their feelings and resolve issues politely. They do science experiments; I was very pleasantly surprised to have my six-year old talk to me about condensation and evaporation. They're encouraged to go out and play and climb and they're taught it's fine to fall down and get a little sweaty and dirty. We loved the multiculturalism in the school; on one occasion, when the kids were taught how to react when they are unable to catch what someone has said, they role-played the situation in English and Mandarin, and one of the kids covered it in French, which I thought was awesome. The high teacher-to-student ratio ensured that teachers were able to give each child individual attention and form close, nurturing relationships. We also liked their involvement with charities. It gave the kids an opportunity to learn that it is a privilege to be able to help the less fortunate, and gave the parents an opportunity to support those in need. The school will provide a firm foundation for further education but what we think makes it stand out, and what we are most grateful for, is the time spent teaching the children self-confidence, self-control, respect for others and social etiquette. For example, one of the (many) lessons was about how to interrupt a conversation politely, another involved teaching the children how holding the door open is a polite and thoughtful act. The school considers social skills an important part of a child's development, and I have noticed that kids from The Little House Montessori are generally polite, kind, respectful and well-adjusted, while still maintaining their own individual, independent personalities. We cannot thank Katherine and the other teachers at The Little House Montessori enough for what they have done for our child.",0.1729142300194932,Topic 5,"['teacher', 'school', 'child', 'kid', 'care', 'good', 'love', 'thank', 'parent', 'principal', 'staff', 'learn', 'son', 'daughter', 'year', 'environment', 'great', 'preschool', 'ms', 'experience']",The Little House (Montessori)

"Both my children have been at The Little House since they were 2.5 years old and it has been the best decision I have ever made as a parent. Ten Things I love about The Little House (Montessori) 1. My kids are ALWAYS excited to go to school, and they are always happy when they come home. 2. My kids have rarely been sick since they started. Compared to being in day-care centres before, I can count on one hand the number of sick days my kids have taken. The space is airy and the children have an outdoors play area. They are allowed to be kids and get dirty, play in grass, in sand, bounce on the trampoline, ride bicycles, play pretend, climb on monkey bars. They don't spend all their time washing hands like in day-care-centres, but are taught proper common sense hygiene. 3. TLH is like an extension of our home. There is a VERY low turnover rate with teachers and so the children feel very safe and secure at school. 4. It is always calm. With 50 -60 kids doing different activities at different times, you would often imagine chaos. But in all the times that I have been at the school, peeked through the glass doors, the school environment has always been very calm and the children are often busying themselves with something. 5. Katherine - the principal of the school leads by example and is personally involved in every child's development. She is the heart of the school and the children and teachers make up the soul. 6. TLH has a wonderful network of parents and alumni. Ex-students are often seen at the school functions and end-of-year concerts. School events are so much fun. 7. Best end-of-year concerts. The first part of the concert is like an open mic event, where kids get to choose with whom they perform with, and what they do. The teachers then help them arrange that. The second part will usually be a play where all props and backdrops are made by the older kids. The last part is always a song where the kids all sing together. This is usually when I start tearing up. The concert is held within the school and lunch is served after. Parents are invited to potluck, so it is really like a huge party for the kids and parents. 8. Cooking is a life skill taught to the children once a week. I run a business teaching people to cook, so this is something that I think is dear to my heart. Younger kids get help in the kitchen, with cutting/slicing. As they get older, they are able to manage the prep more independently. My girls are always excited and proud of themselves when they bring their cooked food home. Even if the food isn't always quite edible, it is a great exercise to get the kids used to. We all have to start somewhere and it is really okay if your biscuits turned out like rocks, or if your sweet and sour dish is more sweet than sour - it's all part of the learning process. All recipes are put on a calendar that the school produces every end of the year. This calendar is customised to have your child's face on the front cover, so it is a great keepsake and gift to grandparents who live overseas. 9. Flexibility. The school is very flexible to accommodating children/parents request. As the school owns the school bus, they are able to be flexible with pick up and drop off requests. Whenever possible, they always try to help parents with playdate drop offs. 10. Method. I think the method that is implemented at the school is extremely well thought through and works. The school is always on top of what each child is doing, and their overall development and progress. Parent Teacher Conferences are held twice a year. If we have any questions, Katherine's door is ALWAYS open for a chat or update. My oldest daughter graduated from The Little House last year and is now in Primary 1. She was able to transition easily because of the self-discipline and independence instilled into her at TLH when it comes to learning. She understands that they is time for work, and time for play. I really recommend TLH as a preschool to be your child's home away from home.",0.1996399824134199,Topic 5,"['teacher', 'school', 'child', 'kid', 'care', 'good', 'love', 'thank', 'parent', 'principal', 'staff', 'learn', 'son', 'daughter', 'year', 'environment', 'great', 'preschool', 'ms', 'experience']",The Little House (Montessori)
"Sent both my kids here. It's a great school that embraces diversity. It's important that our children interact with peers with different needs. Besides preparing the children academically for primary school, TLH also creates space for children to grow in confidence. They teach soft skills explicitly e.g. role-playing appropriate behavior for different settings, and get children to practise them too e.g. washing of plates, looking after the younger children esp on fieldtrips. Both my kids grew in confidence in TLH and enjoys things like real cooking, weekly show and tell, climbing outdoors. This is a true Montessori school. It's also great that the school brings in extra curricular activities like aikido and music so we don't need to send the children for enrichment ourselves.",0.2958333333333334,Topic 5,"['teacher', 'school', 'child', 'kid', 'care', 'good', 'love', 'thank', 'parent', 'principal', 'staff', 'learn', 'son', 'daughter', 'year', 'environment', 'great', 'preschool', 'ms', 'experience']",The Little House (Montessori)

"Dear TLH, When we first started@TLH, we only had a three-year old and being returning singaporeans, we heard about TLH through a friend who homeschools her kids (she heard wonderful stories about TLH from a friend).  When Qi first started, you had asked me this, ""Did you notice that when she runs, she tip-toes? "" Your montessori-trained teachers observe keenly!  i was embarrassed that as a mother,  i have no clue that she does that! Having 4 kids allow us the opportunity to experience TLH longer. Our family enjoy especially the annual year-end concert.  It is, in my opinion, a concert like no other school concert - the children come first rather than the performance (yet we were thoroughly entertained and every year,  TLH took the effort to make a different backdrop :)!  ). There are no grand hotels and thousand-dollar tickets, only a community that chipped in to bring what they have to share. It is good that the preparation for the concert lasted for only a couple of weeks; children are not performers and ThankU for keeping them that way. The teachers you hire are of exceptional calibre: their linguistic capability is a quality that we may not get in every community. Little children's absorbent minds hear the language spoken properly and in turn, they articulate the language correctly too. ThankU for being firm to the little ones in a gentle, loving manner; there is no shouting, only reminding them the right way of doing things. This is where I wonder if it's the methodology or the school setting - perhaps TLH can share with interested parents how this can be done at home!

You can see everywhere that the principal, who is full of kindness and passion, and the teachers with a wealth of experience are paying close attention to each child. This includes the school bus to and from kindergarten. In addition, the individual activity PDFs (with photos) sent regularly are very useful for understanding the atmosphere at the kindergarten and as an opportunity to talk with the children about daily life at the kindergarten.

"""Enrolled my 9 months old boy since 2020 with Jenna as the school principal. Infant care to playgroup experience was fine until we noticed he often came home with big mosquito bites mainly due to the school allowing the children to eat outdoors which have higher exposure to mosquitoes. Poor hygiene issues mainly also arise from the fact that they don’t shower the children after outdoor play. They only change clothes after play and the children sleeps sweaty. All the above issues caused ill health to my toddler. We withdrew our boy due to an incident of negligence whereby our boy was allowed to wear socks in the music room and he bumped his head with big bruises on the forehead. Our heart broke, and when we went to pick him up from Superland Outram, it was highlighted to us he have many ulcers at the back of his mouth again. This was the 3rd time our boy caught HFMD from Superland Outram. The doctor we visited suggested us changing the preschool after hearing our story. To conclude, I think the teachers here are fine but the school policies lacked proper supervision and maintenance. Hygiene and safety was a MAJOR reason why we pulled out. We were informed that the new principal is only working on part time basis. Our child’s attendance only met 5 to 7 days out of 25 days as the rest of the days are spent on us taking leave to look after a sick child. We requested for refund of deposit since 1st September 2022 and we have yet heard back from the school since. Post written on 19 October 2022.

Cons: 1. Infant care teachers turnover quite high, although I met few good teachers, my child always have to adapt to new teachers, school management shall pay more attention to keep the good teachers. 2. there are times i spotted big ants in the infant area, it might due to there is forest behind the school premise.",0.23883522727272724,Topic 5,"['teacher', 'school', 'child', 'kid', 'care', 'good', 'love', 'thank', 'parent', 'principal', 'staff', 'learn', 'son', 'daughter', 'year', 'environment', 'great', 'preschool', 'ms', 'experience']",Superland Pre-School (Outram)

He blossom into an independent toddler and full of curiousity. He started singing and talking alot which I knew he leant from his teachers. He loves his teachers and friends. I especially loves the outdoor element in the school where my son gets lots of sunshine and play. Overall the school is good in their communication with parents and great teachers.

"Just want to share my experience and raise awareness to whoever considering to send their children to this school. I enrolled my Daughter to this school 2 years ago and within this time span, I moved her to a total of 4 different outlets hoping that they may be better but I was so wrong. To think that sending your children to a private preschool may bring you more value, learning and development for your child, think again for this school as my child was mostly playing all the time and could not even get her basics right. It gets worse. The Montessori is just a gimmick to earn more money for the school. I am not sure if the teachers are even properly trained as I feel they are very unprofessional and clueless, wonder how are they even qualified to be Teachers in the first place? I had even witnessed an incident where officers came down for certain checks, and a few classes were brought elsewhere out of the office to “hide”. Believe they could be unlicensed or had no carts. This was my last straw, to have a school doing such acts and shortchanging my child. Isabelle and Danielle (owner and principal of the school) had always tried comforting me by saying that my child was in good hands, my foot. Just trying to make easy money is what both of them are good at. They are salespeople, the kinds you meet when engaging an ID or buying a secondhand car. All promises are made beforehand, and until you have made your purchase, that’s when your worst nightmare comes. Conclusion, if you want to bring your children here, think twice. For the fees you are paying, I believe there are better schools out there. Even government schools are better in my opinion. Anyone has the same thoughts, feel the strong need to share this to everyone.",0.13831417624521072,Topic 5,"['teacher', 'school', 'child', 'kid', 'care', 'good', 'love', 'thank', 'parent', 'principal', 'staff', 'learn', 'son', 'daughter', 'year', 'environment', 'great', 'preschool', 'ms', 'experience']",Superland Pre-School (Outram)
"Superland was the local neighborhood school, we used to love. We started our baby girl in Outram location and since moved to the Tiong Bahru Community Club location. Our baby girl is now K1 and we have seen the expansion of this once admirable school. The pursuit of profit takes a toll on teachers. Safety standards have been dropped. Our girl came back with a big bruise because the playground was not properly padded. They covered the cement with fake grass, that is it, no padding. This location is super secretive. They do not allow parents to enter and poke around. They don't even have a doorbell. Education standards have also been dropped. Chinese curriculum is low. My girl tells me that she does drawings during Chinese lesson. The English teacher is part time and is balancing her schedule between two schools. We thought that the owner and principal care about the children. Now, I'm not so sure. She is likely to kick our kids out of the school for writing this. She thinks parent is the problem, whenever there is a dispute. However, I felt that parents have the right to know and participate in their child's education.

"It is an amazing school, please look for teacher Joey for school information Super friendly lady. My boys enjoyed it a lot especially the outdoor playground! Elder one came back with a lot of stories and the fun he had in school:) I just happen to see the review below parent post regarding to the poor management and bad teaching quality of this school. I could not agree any of these. Below are my responses: 1) Teacher to Student Ratio-It is 10plus to 2 teachers in our N1 class. And in K2 my boy class there is only 10 kids in total. 2)There is an online portal where I am able to communicate anything real time to my boys' teachers and even school admin. they normally respond in one hour. 3)Joey is by far the most responsive teacher I have ever encounter, she works later and replies messages after working hour. 4)I choose this school because of the amazing environment and so far, my boys' class there are no teacher change yet.",0.1829166666666667,Topic 5,"['teacher', 'school', 'child', 'kid', 'care', 'good', 'love', 'thank', 'parent', 'principal', 'staff', 'learn', 'son', 'daughter', 'year', 'environment', 'great', 'preschool', 'ms', 'experience']",Superland Pre-school (Bukit Timah)
Our kids love this school. The teachers are caring and kind and go way above and beyond to address parent concerns on the odd occasion where something goes wrong.

She was super responsive and manage to slot us in for a Sat tour on the same day. Ms Zara was also very good and assuring from the start and made the transition for our son super smooth. I love how they focus on the positive of each child and often assure them and made them feel confident. The centre is bright and big with both indoor and outdoor playground. Our little one has been there for almost 5 months and he enjoys himself everyday. What we loved most was the transparency and how they handle HFMD, Covid, Stomach flu etc, they will give parents first hand information and we appreciate that a lot. My little one is in N1 and Ms Ash and all the assistant teachers, Chinese teachers are amazing.

I am so impressed with Joey! Moving to Singapore was a big change for us and was hesitant about where would be best for our son. I was given a tour by Joey and my son instantly formed a bond with her. We came back 2 weeks later and Joey remembered both of us by name. Her loving and caring nature was exactly what i was looking for. We were made to feel very welcome on both occasions and never pressured to make a decision.

"BEST DECISION EVER to enroll our kids into Superland Bukit Timah! The team of teachers are superb, communicative and professional. Regardless of the massive number of competing schools in this area, Superland stands out as the best in terms of a holistic curriculum and price point (Deep Value). The school is super clean, neat and bright which provides our kids with a good environment for their growth and education. Our son was fairly young (18 months) and we were very uncertain about getting him used to the idea of pre school. Thankfully the team at Superland were very attentive to him and was able to settle him down fairly quickly. We get regular updates through an app and are happy to learn about how he is doing for the day, week and month. For parents who are afraid of HFMD or Covid clusters etc., FEAR NOT! Breakouts are contained fairly quickly as the kid is quickly isolated away in a safe area while the parents are informed within minutes to take their child home. Cluster updates are also given daily to ensure parents that the kids in school are safe.

"We moved to this area and for convenience, picked the school nearest to us with an available slot for our then 18 month-old. This was a brave move for me (I'm a teacher myself) as I usually do a ton of research on anything. But when we saw the space and met Joey and Teacher Puteri, we decided that this was the school for us. Now, 6 months on, we're still loving the school. The space is really, really beautiful. The warm tones sit well with me because it doesn't overwhelm the children, but that's just aesthetic, right? The ones who really make a true difference are the teachers. Every morning, we are greeted with Joey's amazing enthusiasm and my daughter went from crying at the door to walking in confidently, in just a matter of weeks. We are kept in constant update on what's going on in school and we can be sure that Joey is ever-present in her communication with us. Just this morning, there was a crazy thunderstorm and when the teacher saw us parking, she ran out with a giant umbrella so that we'd stay dry.

Depending on the route you take, the downside could probably be that it requires a little walking if you were to get to the school by public transport.

"I should start the review by saying I never wanted to share this to selfishly keep the herds from coming in but that’s not fair so here goes! Our beloved preschool closed some months ago and in choosing a new place, I wanted to join a preschool that was communicative and focussed on play! It was also important to me that the principal was proactive and vested and thankfully, we had the pleasure of encountering Joey and her team at the new super land at Bukit Timah. Apart from the impressive premises that comprises an in house chef, multi language programs and a super cute library for the kids, what convinced me was the communication, effort and friendliness of Joey. She knew all the kids in the school, was quick to attend to any needs or questions, and went out of her way to make me and boy feel comfortable about the transition. Throughout the many school disruptions due to covid, Joey and team were proactive in getting home packs done and are always checking in to see how the kids are going. Now that my boy has been there for months, the Teachers have been patient in attending to his needs even the arduous process of potty training and Joey in particular has reached out to ensure everything including the birth of my second child was a smooth one for me and my boy!

Compared to neighboring gardens, the spacious and bright windows and new facilities were very attractive. Although we live in an area where there are not many Japanese people, there was a 30-minute Japanese class taught by a Japanese teacher every day, and we had them create various events, songs, and productions for each season.

"Our kids have been attending the Superland Pre-school 100AM from its opening in 2019 to the date of this review. It is a Montessori-inspired curriculum (not a full-on Montessori school) and our kids have thoroughly enjoyed the school and really liked their teachers. In addition to immersive Chinese class daily, they also offer Japanese and French classes - our kids really enjoyed both Chinese and Japanese classes!! I feel the curriculum is diverse and fun, lots of hands-on activities and very engaging for the kids while also preparing them well for classroom style education. The teachers have always been so thoughtful and creative, and put in lots of efforts to engage both kids and parents. Even during the last two challenging years of COVID-19, the teachers quickly picked up teaching online and tried their best to show parents kids' progress - nice, fun videos too! A few teachers have changed but usually only at the end of the school year. And as an ex-teacher myself, I know that means the school is a relatively enjoyable working environment so that the teachers were all very considerate when leaving the school; happy teachers = happy kids!! The administration team keeps the parents well informed. One of our favorite thing about the school is its space - it has lots of natural lighting and relatively high ceiling (both rarely found in the CBD area!). Even though has a bit of echo and aircon is quite cold, it feels spacious and has enough space to play. It also has an outdoor field upstairs but due to COVID-19, they have stopped going up -- hopefully it will restart soon!! Another thing that my kids have told me is that they enjoy their meals at school - a small but important thing to note! :) The administration team upkeeps the school very well and communicates with parents regularly - all parents also have direct communication with teachers via an app. We deeply appreciate the wonderful teachers and staff Teacher Abby, Teacher Clarie, Teacher Si, Wang Laoshi, Liu Laoshi, Kaori-sensei and Principal Wahila and Ms. Nisa for supporting our kids through their early education for the past few years!",0.24595601851851848,Topic 5,"['teacher', 'school', 'child', 'kid', 'care', 'good', 'love', 'thank', 'parent', 'principal', 'staff', 'learn', 'son', 'daughter', 'year', 'environment', 'great', 'preschool', 'ms', 'experience']",Superland Pre-School (100 AM) Pte Ltd

He even corrected me when I make sound mistakes. He is now an enjoyable companion coz we communicate so much with each other . Oh yes, he has acquired a great sense of humor too. A few days ago, he proudly claimed that his brain has grown and he's no longer in special classes for 'not so good' (clever students). So proud and happy for him.

Review on Punggol branch My first born Nicole who is now 19 years old in NUS currently was from Sunshine. Surprisingly there are quite a few of her kindergarden ex class friends in VJC during that year. We are quite impress on the early childhood influence. Some things must have done right. My 2nd born Kendric graduated this year 2023 from K2.. overall this is a great neighbourhood school who the management spend great effort . Infant care is a new section so no comments as my son was not from this infant care. He joined in play group and progress along. Teachers overall are fine with some exception ones .. there are ups and down moments especially During covid period. We can see great effort from the principal. The gradulation concert was well planned and great entertaining which leave good memories for all of us.

"I have the most amazing experience to share. My son is diagnosed as 2e (twice exceptional) gifted child with autism + dyslexia. Since infancy, he has problems attending several prestigious childcare centres in town area. He is now in K2, 5 months to Primary 1. I have decided to look for a childcare with a good review of the principal. I told the Principal Ruth truthfully that I need help to integrate him for school readiness, and I am entrusting my son in her hands. TADAH! All my 5 years of worries and struggles are non-existent in this centre! My son fits in readily and happily! REJOICE! It is also our great blessing that his K2 Teacher Maria is special needs trained. For the first time in his life, my son is willing to attend a school outing without me! And wakes up for it! Thank you Principal Ruth, Teacher Maria and Centre Team! If you seek a loving and supportive team, this is where the heart is. BIG THANKS from a very appreciative mum. (first posted 4 months ago) Update My Kayden has graduated! Super thankful to Principal Ruth, Teacher Maria and Fang Laoshi(Chinese language teacher) for putting in so much effort and love to prepare such a good concert!

"I would like to express my deep concerns regarding the quality of education and care at Sunshine Kids Care Centre. My child attended the school for a brief period, and I was extremely disappointed with the level of service provided. One of the most alarming issues I observed was the chronic shortage of teachers. Despite being a well-known neighbourhood preschool, they are continuously understaffed, which results in the children not receiving the appropriate attention they require. I noticed that the turnover rate of teachers was quite high, which further worsened the situation. The lack of continuity in the teaching staff made it difficult for my child to settle in and establish a stable learning routine. Furthermore, the children's turnover rate was also high, which was a cause for concern. The frequent comings and goings of students resulted in a disruptive and unsettling atmosphere for the children. The children require a stable environment to develop their social and learning skills, which the preschool failed to provide. I would advise parents to think twice before enrolling their children at Sunshine Kids Care Centre. The chronic shortage of teachers, high turnover rates, and disruptive atmosphere can have detrimental effects on children's development. I urge the school's management to address these issues promptly to ensure that the children receive the education and care they deserve.",-0.049111111111111105,Topic 5,"['teacher', 'school', 'child', 'kid', 'care', 'good', 'love', 'thank', 'parent', 'principal', 'staff', 'learn', 'son', 'daughter', 'year', 'environment', 'great', 'preschool', 'ms', 'experience']",Sunshine Kids Care Centre @ Punggol Pte Ltd

"My 1st born is one of the first few infant that joined the infant care at Punggol when they started the infant care service. She was 3 months plus when she joined and is 18 months now. Through out the 15 months there, we are happy with her development and thankful to Ms. Ruth (Principal) and the teachers there who showered her with care and love. Over the 15 months, there were some minor scratches sustained but nothing serious. And we were always informed of such scratches by Ms Ruth or the teachers. Occasionally, we would notice diaper rashes and would feedback to the teachers/Principal and the teachers there would take extra care to change the diaper more frequently throughout the day. All in all, I think being a neighbourhood childcare and infant care, they had done an excellent job in taking care of my daughter and contributed to her development. The centre also organizes events during festive period and invite the parents to participate which I think it's a good initiative to allow parents to have a glimpse of how the centre culture is like.

The school teachers did not inform me immediately. When my wife and i fetched our baby, we noticed the cut and the teacher lied that it was due to our baby to pull the helmet of other baby. We knew that there are CCTV cameras installed on the center and we asked principal for an explanation. After a long delay, the principal told us that it was likely due to a circular teaching tool which had sharp edges and that the babies were not well seated on chairs and the tool was passed around among the babies. In addition to the cut, we noticed that almost all babies cried when a china teacher carried them. Upon further enquiry with a former teacher, we found out that the teacher scolds the babies everyday and we also saw that she shook an infant violently when the infant cried.

"""To be honest, when we first toured the school we did not like it very much but still decided to give it a chance. Contrary to the tour we had with the prev sch where the teachers tried to engage, smiles and talk to my son, the teachers at Sunflower Preschool did not bother to engage or talk. (This was on a Saturday) The Principal does not seem to know what she was talking about and when asked questions, the answers she gives were uncertain. I think this is where we should have caught the signs and not enroll him. On the first day of school, one of the parents will be allowed to sit in for an hour to let the child adapt. I witness a few things in the school and was straightaway uncomfortable with putting my son in the care of the teachers there. The list are as follows: 1. One of the teacher wearing a mask kissed another infant (Honestly, i can understand if sometimes teachers very sayang the baby then they wanna hug them or cuddle and kiss them. However, there are a lot of germs on the mask.) 2. During shower, the teacher look frustrated when showering my son as he was no familiar with the place and kept crying. ( You can tell from the mannerism) 3. During milk feeding time, the teacher vigorously shakes the bottle while the bottle was in my son’s mouth to make him drink the milk. 4. The school strictly limits milk for my then 11 MONTH OLD son at 1PM & 4PM only. This is actually my dealbreaker. There is not flexibility whatsoever. I have called the principal to discuss this however she was firm and would not give any leeway. Her reason being - they are at the age where they have to train their motor skill (?) Something along the line. I have checked with other schools and there is no such policies or rules in their IFC. 5. I don’t believe the school was honest. In the school app, the school always input that my son finishes his milk. My son always have a problem w drinking his milk and there will alw be leftover. Even in the previous school, he hd an issue with milk intake and the teacher will feedback in the school app accordingly. 6. On his first day of school, HALF DAY. I trusted my son in their care and he came back w a bruise on his face. Usually i would be OK with this kind of injury as they are learning how to walk and are crawling around. But it is the first day of school and he was there for only 3 hours without my supervision. You would think that the teachers will pay more attention to the new infant attending a new school but it does not seem to be the case. I completely understand that accidents can happen but not when it is the first day of school and they are most definitely not short-handed if they are a ratio of 1:3. 7. The school is an air-conditioned facility. After showering they will put the baby in the play area where the FAN is blowing directly at them. 8. My son fall sick 3 times in the less than one month he was there. The first time was runny nose, second and third was back to back stomach flu. He had ongoing runny nose for few weeks. I had to take a lot of AL and CCL due to these. There was no notification from the school of related cases. I believe this is negligence from the school part. 9. The principal is really clueless. The school app does not allow teachers to communicate w the parents directly and only the principal has access to the school communication app. During the first day, when i asked the principal about the access for the school app, she merely said,” er, you should have access w the app cause same as prev school.” She obviously doesnt know what she was talking about. I checked w the admin afterwards. 10. We told the school that we would like to withdraw our son on the third day. However, we have to serve a month notice else our deposit will be forfeited. He cried everyday he attended school. It was heartbreaking. In view of the above reasons, if they dared behave like this infront of the parent. I wonder how they are like behind closed curtains.

"My 13months old child has been in this IFC since 3 months old. What I like about the center is the very low turnover rate. Since my child started school, the core team of full time teachers has not changed at all except for one who had to leave due to medical reason. This helps with establishing consistent routines for my child such as nap routines. And I think having low turnover helps in building relationship with my child, allowing her to feel safe and secure with the familiar adults. This is very evident every morning at drop offs when she is happy to go school, she baobao the teacher spontaneously. In terms of communication with parents, they used an app but it's to update on the day activities (without picture) of the child (e.g. nap start and end time, milk feed volume, diaper change time). Then every two weeks, the P would send a one page file, usually with two pictures, of what my child has done for the two weeks. In short, dont expect a lot of photo updates. I'm actually very happy with this arrangement because it means the teachers' phone usage time is very low. They can really focus on the children. Anyway they update me every time at pick up and drop off so I think that's good enough for me. Overall, the P and teachers are very assuring and always work collaboratively with us. Once in a while, the teachers will advise me to work on certain skills which I found really helpful. — Add on: With regards to feeding, based on my little one’s experience in the school (but please check in with school), before they go on solids, the milk schedule is individualised. We have to key in the app the last feed we gave to our baby before sending to school so that they know what time to give the next feed. In fact there was once I forgot to key and teacher had to call me. Then when my little one is able to sit well on a chair (usually around 7months), they will be given oats at 10am (replace a milk feed) - you can either choose to eat the one given by school or you provide. Then when she was promoted to mobile side, usually around 10-11months when they can stand, the oats was replaced with porridge and there is also a tea break (most of the time are fruits) at about 3pm. After one year old, there’s also breakfast at 8am. I find the teachers really understanding because they tried replacing the 8am milk feed with the breakfast provided but my girl kept crying despite consuming a lot of the breakfast. They updated me at pick up on the same day and told me most likely she couldn’t adapt to the change (for breakfast only, she was ok with the rest of the solids at other timings that were introduced much earlier) and suggested to continue to give her a little milk in school and then they will give her a reduced portion of breakfast after that. We agreed, the teachers tried and it worked! So I would say there is flexibility when there is a need to!",0.13846493675595242,Topic 1,"['school', 'child', 'time', 'teacher', 'centre', 'day', 'parent', 'son', 'month', 'kid', 'bad', 'baby', 'principal', 'cry', 'send', 'like', 'know', 'money', 'enrol', 'feel']",Sunflower Preschool @ Teck Ghee Pte Ltd
"had to say something after seeing a 1-star review of the IFC, which our daughter is in since when she was only 2+months. She has been with the IFC for 10+ months now. Overall, we are very pleased to have found this rare gem at such a price point. WHY? 1. the IFC has its own dedicated space and does not cluster-congregate with PG, N1 & N2. There was a sofa within for teachers to 'rest' and feed the babies. 2. the teachers, mostly mandarin speaking, really care of the babies. will there be accidents? yes, my daughter hit her head a couple of times, but hey, try taking care of 3 babies concurrently. what I appreciate is that the teachers were transparent and share during dismissal without sweeping under the carpet. 3. the principal often pops over and will personally cover any shortfall in manpower / MC. Have seen her doing so a few times. because afterall, everyone knows taking care of babies are not easy because they are more vulnerable. 4. There is regular teacher-parents meet with parents. This tickled us previously because honestly, what is there to update for babies? and also, they already updated us weekly and also biweekly over the app. The principal works on Sunday and send parents the biweekly update on Sunday. if this isn't dedication, I don't know what is. 5. when our baby girl had eczema, the IFC teachers were very willing to help with the cream application because they were truly concerned. They also spent the effort to 'troubleshoot' with us initially on what might be the cause, changing bath lotion and body cream. 6. when my baby was transiting to solids, I was very worried because she had a couple of episodes vomiting in her sleep midnight. The Principal and IFC teachers worked hand-in-glove with us to help tide through this phase, sharing in full details of their meals / ingredients and even calling me personally to address my worries. Did I ever think of pulling my baby out and changing centres? Being a first time parent, yes, I did. Because she kept falling sick every 2 ~ 3 weeks initially. but after reading some parents' forum, I realised it is the rite of passage for all babies/children, even for IFCs which charge $2+K per month. Further, babies do develop awareness over time. It is traumatic for babies to change schools and change carers. Hence, I dropped the idea completely. Glad I did. and yes, I do recommend this IFC as long as it is the same Principal and the same IFC teachers. :)",0.11378648233486943,Topic 5,"['teacher', 'school', 'child', 'kid', 'care', 'good', 'love', 'thank', 'parent', 'principal', 'staff', 'learn', 'son', 'daughter', 'year', 'environment', 'great', 'preschool', 'ms', 'experience']",Sunflower Preschool @ Teck Ghee Pte Ltd
"Had to share my experience after seeing the 1 star review & feels that somehow things doesn't add up here. Sent my first child there since he was 4 months old & 2nd child also managed to enroll in the school, both receive lots of love & affection from all teachers. Communication has always been a breeze with the school teachers & principle, in the initial phase when the app wasn't available yet & also now, with the usage of the app. They will usually give an informal short update when we pick the kids up as well. The team has always been very transparent with the kids activities, be it good or bad. This gives us the confidence that they are actually bother about the wellbeing & growth of our kids. Feed scheduling: I left this to the experts as they are trying to establish a feed routine for the kids & in the long term it will make life easier for everyone, parents included, since the kids will want to feed at a fixed timing, making it easier to plan around them. Injuries: refer to top.. Very transparent about all incidents thus far. They will call us if it is too serious but hey whats growing up without a few bumps & bruises? With regards to the kids falling sick while in school, it is a known fact that this will happen no matter which pre-school they are sent to. Probably the only way to skip this is to bubble wrap them in a clean room environment, i guess. No issue with the communication over the app or what so ever. They have a hotline & whatsapp number for emergency contact, in case you need them for whatever reasons. Curtians.... Hmm, given the location of the school beside a common walkway from a busstop, I can understand why curtains are needed. Certian level of privacy should be given to the occupants of the school, be it the teachers or the kids.

"When we were expecting our first child, we were not sure whether we would hire a nanny or enroll to an infant care. Not convinced by the first option, we visited over twenty infant cares before coming accross Sunflower Baby House. We liked that it was a good size school, not too big, not too small, with kids from different background and nationalities. Ms Angela and her caring team made us feel reassured and confident about the school before joining and since Day 1 after we did. We’ve never looked back and love how the team had always been so loving with our children. Being foreigners, we had no family support and having our kids at Sunflower enabled us to juggle between work and the family with the peace of the mind. The school feels like a little family thanks to its great caring team and the parents we became friends with. The teachers always took the time to engage and discuss with us, whenever we had any question or concern, they would always address them. Aside from that, what stood out is the Chinese level. It is very impressive compared to other schools that claim to be “bilingual”. Our kids loved learning Chinese thanks to the laoshi they had who have been at Sunflower for decades. All in all, for families looking for a nurturing environment for their child(ren), please consider Sunflower baby house on your list and have a look!

"We chose Sunflower for our older boy (now P3) when he was 9 months old primarily because there used to be a branch less than 5 minutes' drive from our place. When that branch had to close we were too lazy to find a new childcare centre so we moved to the (original) Grandstand branch. Our younger one followed when he was 3.5 months. We don't have a helper and my husband and I both work FT, so finding an infantcare centre we could trust was important. I didn't feel the need in the past 8 years to be overly concerned about how they were doing in infantcare, then PG, nursery and kindergarten; they were always happy, thriving, and well taken care of physically and emotionally by the teachers. They enjoyed a range of enrichment activities provided by the centre, and - this is important - were adequately prepared through Sunflower's Chinese programme for SAP school life. Notwithstanding there being no 听写 (that I knew of anyway, lol). We didn't send either of them for Chinese enrichment or tuition before P1 and have managed to hold out pretty well to now, we'll see how P3 goes. The boys enjoyed their time with Sunflower, and we were very blessed to have met some wonderful parents and children as well. As with all things, your experience and perception may vary from mine, but I think there's generally no real need to be too uptight about nursery/kindergarten life. Our children, like us before them, will grow up and become their own persons in spite of whatever their parents do or don't do. Sunflower was good for parents like us because we really didn't have to bother much about how the boys were doing - they did well.

They are very responsive to parents' needs and will do their best to meet our expectations. This school provides relatively good quality of toys and books for children. They also have their own playground facilities, children don't have to go to public playground to play. There are also many fun activites in school which help children to learn faster and better. Role play, drama, story telling etc...make learning so much more interesting ! In K2 , children will learn more about Maths, writing words and short sentences in English and Chinese. All these helps in preparation for Primary 1. My child loves going to school, everyday she would come home and tell me what she does in school and how she much she loves the fun activites. Very grateful to these amazing staff especially the Principal, she is very thoughtful, kind, helpful and easy to talk to. Whenever we need help, she is always there. This makes us feel safe to put our child in school. So thankful to the whole team at Upper Bukit Timah Star Learner!!

My son attended Star Learners @ Telok Kurau for 8 months and during that time, he formed strong bonds with his teachers and classmates. The teachers at the center are truly exceptional - they are warm, caring, and always went above and beyond to ensure that my son felt comfortable and supported. I was also very impressed with the quality of the curriculum. The center offers a well-rounded program that incorporates both academic and social-emotional learning. My son was exposed to a range of activities and experiences that helped him develop his cognitive, motor, and social skills. The facilities are also top-notch. The center is bright, clean, and filled with age-appropriate toys and materials. The outdoor play area is also great - my son loved running around and playing with his friends in the fresh air. Finally, I appreciated the open communication between the staff and parents. The teachers were always available to answer my questions and provide updates on my son's progress.

"Terrible 'school'. It was apparent to us in our short time there that the centre is a business and not a school that cares for children. The school principal Ms V was unprofessional and seemed disinterested in the well-being of the children. Shady and avoidant responses were frequently given. She constantly dismiss our concerns. The facilities are dirty and not well-maintained. Children's feet are black during pick up and the shoes area stink. There were several sickness outbreak incidents that were not handled promptly. We caught HFMD AND covid within our first month there. Let alone other viruses. School staff pushes the blame to viruses in our home environment. The communication from the school was poor. I was never informed of any important events or issues let alone daily updates regarding my child. The list goes on... After asking around, we learned from other families that they do not particularly know why they still remain in the school and their children didn't thrive in this centre. See shocking text messages circulating in the community below. School principal Ms V does not seem to care. While I can appreciate each individual teacher and helper at the school, the staff as a whole seemed overwhelmed and unable to provide sufficient support to the children. I worried about the quality of care provided to my child on a daily basis. It was an exhausting period for us and I would not recommend this child care center to any parent. We are now happy in a new centre for over a year and can say that in comparison, Star Learners @ Telok Kurau falls far short of adequate.

"I would like to compliment all the teachers and staffs in Star Learners @ Sengkang Sports Centre on their wonderful teaching skills and all care they gave to the children. All the contribution from them lead to the wonderful improvement in my children's performance during the years. Principal Mrs Diana always keeps a very positive direction for the school which provided educational and interesting activities for both parents and children. The activities were not only simple interesting but also very meaningful. Children visited the Singapore Health Board to learn how to have a healthy habit in their daily life, they went to the Peranakan Museum to explore different culture and they went to Air Base Museum to have hands on experience to the airplanes.  The school also organised many parents-child activities. For example, the Father’s Day celebration were held always in a form of sports competition and activities. It was not only making the father and children closer, but also reminds the importance of health. For Mother’s Day, centre also organised very meaningful talks for mothers and grandmothers, such as “How important is regular gynaecological check-up”. The activities were not only help to widen children’s knowledge, but also show great care to the parents. The teachers in the school are very knowledgeable and responsible to all the children, for both academic results and their daily life. My daugher is a quiet girl and always shy to speak out. With Teacher Nasreen and Xiao Lao Shi’s teach and help, she is now much more confident than previous. She got great improvement in academic performance in English, Math and Chinese. She has also acquired deep interest in the above subjects with teachers’ encouragement. My son is always too active and sometime naughty. However, with the care from Yu Lao Shi and Teacher Liza, he learnt how to behave himself well and how to be a polite and nice boy. Both also received care from all the teachers and staffs in the centre. Aunty Yati helps to provide a clean environment to them and Aunty Toh always prepares healthy and delicious food for them.

"As parents, we might have given them some hard time from time to time, but these teachers from Sengkang Sport have performed outstandingly well in our opinion. We would like to highlight their strength and give thanks to teachers of N2 for the effort that they have put forth this year. Teacher Liza ============= This year we manage to see Teacher Liza on a more prominent role as the N2 English teacher. As parents we are very happy on how she manages the class. She is firm when needed, as N2 class is more discipline and in order when going on excursion and also gentle when students needed her. As our daughter easily get bored and learn fast on certain situation, Teacher Liza will at times teach her some new songs and also learn basic math calculation while waiting for the kids' turn to go to the toilet, making learning fun by using elements around the environment. From my understanding it is not part of the curriculum at the point of time, and we are much appreciated that Teacher Liza have taken the initiative to do so, to keep our daughter engaging and make learning fun for her. our daugther will always come home waiting to learn to count more stuff and even teach us parents new songs. At time Teacher Liza has try to follow up on how daugther is doing at home to understand our daugther character more in dept. We truely appreciate her effort and care for our daughter. Yu Liaoshi =========== Last year we were really impressed with Yu Liaoshi. And this year is no different. We truly appreciate Yu Liaoshi patient for teaching our daughter Chinese. Our daugther will come home excited to tell us all the beautiful Chinese words to practise and dance. Coming from a non-chinnese speaking family, at times it is very hard to follow up with our daugther's Chinese language. Yu Liaoshi have been very helpful explaining to us parents on what our daugther have learn in school and also show us books during previous PTC on our daugther favourite Chinese book in class and share abit about the book story. As parents we love to follow up with our daugther after school and Yu Liaoshi have gone her way to write down the han-yu pi-yin on the home activities for Syafiqah, making it possible for us to do so. We truely appreciate that she have gone out of her way to assist us and be very patient on teaching our daughter. N2 Teachers ============ For the past 2 years, our daughter had to deal with teacher from her class leaving the school. And at times we are worried for our daughter development as she could get very attached to a teacher one day and suddenly her favourite teacher leaving the other day. We are very happy that Teacher Liza and Yu Liaoshi have been around for the whole of this year to guide our daugther development. Both of them are excellence teachers and work in sync with each other. Making our experience with the school engaging, interactive and worry free as we know our daugther is in good hands. As parents we would love to see both Teacher Liza and Yu Liaoshi be guiding our daugther through K1, as some of her friends (Best friends included) will be leaving school for MOE kindergarten next year. And having both Teacher Liza and Yu Liaoshi will really help our daugther go true these hard times. School Development =================== This year we saw much of the school rebranding and we parents really welcome and appreciate the school effort to make things easy for us parents and teachers. There were bugs in the school app in the beginning, which was expected for any new software. At times bugs like not receiving app notification, not receiving invoices and etc happen and the school principle and teachers have been very helpful in relaying information to parents, to bridge in the gap. We are happy that the app has made things easy and more secure for parents to view school activities photos, invoices, e-consent, buying of uniform and much much more.",0.25043943576552263,Topic 5,"['teacher', 'school', 'child', 'kid', 'care', 'good', 'love', 'thank', 'parent', 'principal', 'staff', 'learn', 'son', 'daughter', 'year', 'environment', 'great', 'preschool', 'ms', 'experience']",Star Learners @ Sengkang Sports Centre | Preschool & Childcare
"My girl has been with the centre since 2015 and graduating this year. My boy is now in PG. Teachers came and left, and each one of them had always left a deep impression on my children, especially Nayli, who is graduating this year. The smiles that the teachers put on every morning, greeting the children when they are dropped at school, makes it so welcoming for the children. To us parents, who might always look like we are in a rush to drop them off so that we can run off to work, seeing the smiles and the cheery ""Good morning!"" or ""Zhao an!"" never fails to uplift my mood for the start of the day. The staff were truly accommodating, especially in ensuring that Zuhaily is being managed better in the school, which at times will mean that Nayli has to be taken out of her class to reassure Zuhaily that everything will be alright. The staff have always been prompt in updating the goods and bads that happened in the centre albeit I cannot deny the fact that my heart jumps everytime I receive a call from the centre. However, deep down inside I know that the teachers are trying their best to do as much as they can. The occasional video updates given to me. It just reassures me that I made the right choice enrolling my kids into Star Learners. Zuhaily had a new English teacher this year, Ms Gill. Her addition to the centre was a nice complement to the centre as well. Zuhaily comes back and will excitedly share the things that he did in school, and most importantly, he remembers what has been done. He will make it a point to get us to read the personalised Children's Day card that Ms Gill has written for him. The occasional updates written about Zuhaily in the comm book is also much appreciated. Thank you Ms Gill! The teachers adore Zuhaily so much and I am so thankful that he is given so much love. What heartens me the most is when Nayli took so much time and effort to write a personalised message for each of the teachers on her cards for Teachers' Day. That is just a reflection of how much of an impression the teachers have left on her, does not matter whethere they are in direct contact with her or not. And enrolling Ms Siti into her Kids' Club? That sounds very exclusive. The Chinese teachers, namely Xiao LaoShi, Yu LaoShi, Zhang LaoShi and Meng LaoShi have been doing such a good job in teaching Mandarin in a fun way, given that Mandarin is not our Mother Tongue. Occasionally, Zuhaily will break into Mandarin at home when we are playing or reading. It has also been useful for both Nayli and Zuhaily to engage with our elderly neighbour who only communicates in Mandarin. Ms Nasreen has done such a wonderful job in preparing Nayli for Primary 1. It is highly engaging and teaching them and preparing them for the real life cum next year. I appreciate the time when she was trying to educate Nayli the importance of being humble. Thankiew Ms Gan for loving Zuhaily so much. He will always remember his pet name, Ali Baba. :) Thankiew Ms Siti for being such a comfort to Zuhaily, knowing that you are someone whom he can turn to when he feels insecure in school. In fact, you have such a warm personality that both my children can attest to that. Ms Zilla is also a teacher who makes effort to make things fun for the children, and i feel that she can totally let loose just to ensure that the children listen and enjoy their learning. Thankiew Ms Liza for teaching fun dance moves to the children during the special events in school. And Mrs Diana, thank you for always being attentive to the needs of the parents and the children, and as a principal of the centre, i am truly impressed that you take time to connect with the children and remembers all their names as well! :) I have never regretted my decision to put my children in Star Learners @ North East.",0.24300384359908175,Topic 5,"['teacher', 'school', 'child', 'kid', 'care', 'good', 'love', 'thank', 'parent', 'principal', 'staff', 'learn', 'son', 'daughter', 'year', 'environment', 'great', 'preschool', 'ms', 'experience']",Star Learners @ Sengkang Sports Centre | Preschool & Childcare
"My Daughter had switched from another childcare centre to Starlearners@SK Sports Centre in January 2018 as N2. And for my Son had started schooling as N1 this year January 2019. We have no regrets to place both of our kids in Starlearners Sports Centre branch, because we can see their growth! Most importantly, they love their teachers Ms Sitti, Ms Zhang, Ms Zila, Ms Meng and Teacher Assistant Ms Gan very much! I can tell that they love the Principal, Aunty Toh and Aunty Yati too, because whenever my kids talk about them, they are always so happy! Under the tremendous care and concern given by the School's Staffs, we as parents, are absolutely very happy to see our children are well-taken care of and they enjoy going to the school. ==================================== Beginning of this year 2019, I am very worried about my Daughter's phonics because alot of my surrounding friends sent their kids for external Phonics class. I didn't send my girl to any external enrichment class, as I do not want to stress my kid. So, I had called up Ms Sitti to have a talk with her & get her advices. With her assurance, I had told my hubby to give our daughter some time. And at home, I will try to recap her phonics and what she had learnt from school. Sometimes, my girl will tell me,"" Ms Sitti said this is a magic word!""  I guess she is learning Phonics well in a fun way. Indeed, we had seen progression in our Daughter's phonics along the way. Many thanks to Ms Sitti's way of teaching Phonics to her. As for my Son's 2nd day of school, he cried badly when I walked away and hide myself during his naptime. Ms Zhang is very patient in handling him and manage to coax him to sleep. He kept crying and do not want to school in Jan and Feb. However, Ms Meng Or Ms Zhang will always help to calm him down. Slowly, my boy had started to adapt himself and love going to school. Apart from that, his communication in English had improved too..Thank u, Ms Zila for teaching him English! At times, our Son do catch my hubby and me in surprise, when he speaks English. =) All these efforts are really worth complimenting for... ==================================== Lastly, I must take this chance to thank the Principal Mrs Diana! She is a very passionate and dedicated Principal! Take for recent case about the long overdue referral fee that I had brought up to her. It was supposed to be my friend's child Centre Principal's job to settle it, but Mrs Diana made an attempt to followup closely and reminded that Centre Principal about it. I really appreciate her effort for making the extra miles. Cheers to Mrs Diana's great mentorship, Passionate Teachers and Caring Support Staffs, who make me totally feel no regrets in placing both of my kids there! =) Thank u for all the love to my children! ❤",0.22134589947089947,Topic 5,"['teacher', 'school', 'child', 'kid', 'care', 'good', 'love', 'thank', 'parent', 'principal', 'staff', 'learn', 'son', 'daughter', 'year', 'environment', 'great', 'preschool', 'ms', 'experience']",Star Learners @ Sengkang Sports Centre | Preschool & Childcare

"My child is in N1. The teacher dont provide any updates about my child in school. Enrolled in 1 Mar 2022. Other than first week of school the form teacher Fina provide update on my child progress, after that totally no updates from the teacher on how is my child coping/behaving in school. No monthly updates or quarter review from the school about child performance. Checked with my friends from other schools, their school/teacher provide monthly updates to the parent on the child performance. Whenever we ask the form teacher on how is my daughter doing in school, she’ll just say oh she’s adapting well, just a general remark from the teacher. Since May, my daughter is toilet trained and weaned of diapers at home other than nap/night time. When we inform the teacher about it, they say we have to work hand in hand. But end up, the school didn’t assist her with toilet training. When ask the form teacher on training, she got defensive and said “as I told you the other time, we have to work hand in hand.” Back then already informed her my girl is potty trained but the form teacher/school is not assisting on this. I can send my girl in at 10am and pick her up at 5pm, 6 diapers were used and this is a common sight. Form teacher didn’t bother to inform us of any extra curriculum activity that is happening in school. There isn’t any on boarding or introduction when we enroll our kid in. For example, the school have their own app. The form teacher said will have a walkthrough with us and briefly explain to us on the app. We asked her several times on the app, she just say y’all explore it on your own. We weren’t aware that if the school have any announcement or notice will be communicated to parent via the app. It’s only after the teacher said we didn’t provide our consent for a certain activity that is happening in school, then we are aware that, oh any formal communication is shared via the app. Withdrawing my child at the end of July 2022, because of the N1 form teacher attitude, constantly emphasizing as I mentioned to you before bla bla bla... The school informed that school fees were not deducted from CDA account. I filled in the giro application form during the enrollment, but apparently the form wasn’t submitted, not sure where the form went or it got leaked out. As no deduction were made nor did the bank contact me with regards to the giro arrangement. The Chinese teacher were very nice and treat my daughter well, as my daughter mentioned that the lao Shi will coax her to sleep, and play with her.

"I sent my son to Star Learner's childcare center based on a friend's referral when he was just 18 months old, and it turned out to be the best decision I ever made. We relocated to the Bedok area when he was nearing the end of K1, and we transferred him to Star Learner's at Bedok. I am delighted to share that my son had a fantastic experience at Star Learner's at Yio Chu Kang, and he was warmly welcomed by the new principal, teachers, friends, and the caring staff at Star Learner's at Bedok. One of the aspects that impressed me about Star Learner's is their approach to teaching. They have a monthly theme that is incorporated into the main books and accompanying materials. Through these themed activities, the children explore and grasp important concepts. Additionally, Star Learner's emphasizes discipline and instills the values of courage, integrity, and grit in preschoolers. It's not just about academics; the children also learn valuable social skills and the importance of giving back and being responsible citizens. I cannot speak highly enough of the teachers at Star Learner's. They are dedicated and passionate about their work, and their commitment to the children's well-being is evident. The principal, lunch staff, and cleaning staff are all courteous and show genuine care for the kids. It's clear that they have a customer-centric attitude, making the experience even more pleasant for both parents and children. The highlight of the year for K2 graduates is the Graduation concert, which showcases the children's growth and achievements. It's a wonderful celebration that creates lasting memories for the children and their families. In conclusion, I wholeheartedly recommend Star Learner's at Bedok to any parents who genuinely care about their children's future. The center provides a nurturing and stimulating environment where children not only excel academically but also develop important life skills. My son's time at Star Learner's has been nothing short of exceptional, and I am grateful for the care and dedication shown by the entire team.",0.3076246334310851,Topic 5,"['teacher', 'school', 'child', 'kid', 'care', 'good', 'love', 'thank', 'parent', 'principal', 'staff', 'learn', 'son', 'daughter', 'year', 'environment', 'great', 'preschool', 'ms', 'experience']",Star Learners @ Bedok Pte Ltd

They need a healthy heart and mind to grow up. This is the first time I witness such a indifferent childcare centre and it's scary to imagine how a young child would be negatively affected seeing how some adults there behave and how rules are being enforced there. To give u some examples of their way of managing the centre:no visitors other than parents allowed(not even for a young kid who needs much adjustment to the new environment. Even parents, the director Sharon told me strictly 3visits per week allowed), cold attitudes towards visitors including grand parents, young sister of the child and caregivers. All parents and caregivers, when you hear your child crying for help in such a centre by behaving strangely at home after school, who could you ask for help from?

The classrooms are bright, spacious, and thoughtfully designed to stimulate young minds. The outdoor play areas are fantastic, providing ample space for exploration and physical activity. We appreciate the school's commitment to safety and cleanliness, ensuring that our child is in a healthy environment at all times. Communication with the preschool has been exceptional. The staff maintains open lines of communication with parents, keeping us informed about our child's progress, daily activities, and any special events.

The Teachers can also remember their name even though they never teach them . Haha . They really check through the kids temperature and hand/foot / mouth everyday without fail.

"Love the school ! Thanks to the dedicate and patient teachers. I can go to work in peace. The admin responds fast and the principal knows the name of my child! I rarely pick my child up and the closing teacher, who have not seen me before would triple check before releasing my child to me. The teachers really check my child thoroughly and they are very strict on the health checks and they really don't compromise on health and safety aspect. I love the regular updates on little lives and also the termly updates. The updates on little lives are so personalise and the termly updates are very accurate, my 2 year old often come home singing, counting and talking about things taught in class as per described on the termly updates. My child have been with them since infancy the teacher to child ratio is fabulous and thanks to the bus service my toddler can go to school!

"My elder boy had graduated from Small wonder last year. I have to say I love this school so much and had recommended so many other children into this school! The principal, teachers and staffs were very patient and helpful. And also very cheerful! We always know taking care of children can be very draining... And the teachers can really keep their moods up all the way! Thank you so much! Now my younger boy is in Small Wonder now. He has delayed development condition, so when he enter schoo, he couldnt walk very stable yet... And also he is still not able converse yet, but the principal, Miss Karen and his teachers have been very patient with him. They accept who he is and also treat him the same like others. I can feel that every bit of nuturing heart the teachers Celeste and Li xin 老师 put in. And also every morning, he will always looking forward to go to school. The kids are always greeted by very lively teachers. The school is very big and food served are good. They recently also have an award for their food. Basically, every morning when we put them thru the door, we will rest our mind to Continue our work or life because they are in great hands! 😊 If you want your child to be in a happy and positive environment to learn, small wonder serangoon North is the place!

"Love this centre at first sight -The HUGE indoor playground, the conducive environment, and the BIG space for the kids to grow and spend their full day makes me soooo excited when I first visited the centre in 2015. We decided to move 3 of our kids from a childcare centre right below our blk to Small Wonder @ SN as we know that they will love going to school and be as excited as me if they were to see this exciting place. From the curriculum to the daily healthy menu plus the indoor playground which is as big as a HDB 5-room flat (Yes, I'm not kidding!), what more can we ask for when we are looking for a full day centre for our little kiddos? When HFMD was rising in numbers, the school made a firm decision to stop all parents from entering the centre and adopted drop-off at entrance. This has caused much inconvenience to the school as they are highly shorthanded and teachers are supposed to be in the class with their students. I applaud them to go the extra mile just to ensure that the HFMD numbers are controlled to create that safe environment for the kiddos. When I had my #4, I know straight away where to send her to. The infant teachers gave us daily updates via a booklet on meals, diaper change, nap and activities of my baby - and even allow me to breastfeed my baby as and when I need (during non-covid days). Every morning when I send my 8 months old baby in, the assurance the teachers gave me allows me to stay focus on my work. A few dedicated teachers along the way has tear with us when we face some problems with the kids and walk through the changes with us. I can still remember how Karen (current centre principal) walks through with me when I am emotionally shaken with my twin boy who cannot stay focus in class. They never give up on any child and Karen spent a good few hours talking and listening to me while I pour my concern to her. Another incident was during the first few days of school, my eldest was still not familiar with the new faces and was crying before entering school. Shortly after I reached office (still thinking if she can cope), Karen whatsapp me with photos of my child playing happily with her friends in class. I am actually taken by surprise when I received the whatsapp pic as I'm not expecting any school to give real time updates to parents as they have too many kids to look after. Of course after seeing that photo, I can focus more @ work. Teachers who don't teaches our kids takes the effort to remember our kids by their names which makes the kids comfortable when they enter the school every morning. During Circuit Breaker Days, most of our friends' childcare has no HBL and kids are just given random worksheets to work on for the 2 months. But in SW, the teachers did up the HBL curriculum to engage the kids within a very short time frame. From reading to singing and experimental crafts, we were amazed on how fast they get to turnaround this whole episode to engage the kids. Not to mention that there was even a courier arranged to deliver some books to the kids as part of the engagement. This allows the kids to stay engaged with their teachers and peers, and has no fear on returning back to school when school reopens. My eldest had graduated in SW in 2018 - but each time when she fetches the younger siblings with us, the teachers still hug and call out to her and Children's day present was given to her through her younger siblings every year without fail. My twins will be graduating this year (2020). Afterwhich, I will have my youngest who will be graduating in 2022. All in all, we had spent a good 5 years with Small Wonder @ SN and still counting on. Generally, my kids love school and now says 'bye mummy' to me every morning. Small Wonder had taken away my biggest worry on daycare for my kids and this is exactly what we need as parents. We are glad that we had found this school and met all the dedicated teachers and principal along the way. When my youngest graduate in 2022, we are definitely going to miss this childcare.",0.14193581418581416,Topic 5,"['teacher', 'school', 'child', 'kid', 'care', 'good', 'love', 'thank', 'parent', 'principal', 'staff', 'learn', 'son', 'daughter', 'year', 'environment', 'great', 'preschool', 'ms', 'experience']",Small Wonder Preschool (Serangoon)
"My child has been enrolled in this branch for almost 2 years since infant and now he is nearing end of N1. The teachers I had encountered with are patient, caring and committed. Every morning, I see different class teachers and their Admin doing temperature taking, checking for hfmd and sanitization. It seem like the teachers are rotated to the duties. Some teachers could even remember my son, despite not teaching him before. (maybe my son was to naughty?) Whenever there is sickness out break, the senior teacher or principal would send email updating us on the condition till the outbreak ended. My child normally arrived at 7.30am, he will be gathered in a room with the other early arrivals. I will see 1 or 2 teachers taking care of them. My son enjoy that moment as he got to interact with his buddy. At around 8am, his form teacher will fetch him n classmates to class. Via their little lives platform, I could see my son weekly activities like painting, exploring snails, reading, presenting his toy, story telling etc etc.... This gives me some knowledge of what he had learnt in school. He could even share with me or sing the songs. Recently they implemented student card for parents to fetch their child/children . Without the card, they will not release the child. One child has 2 student card. Despite this is a good implementation, but I think the card can be easily duplicated at home. Maybe having barcode or QR code to identify the child will be better? There was a period of time, when my son was constantly misbehaving and restless, his class teacher (yang Laoshi) called me to check on him. She gave me some suggestions on handling him at home and it works. After a period of time, she would follow up and feedback if there is any improvement. I appreciate her commitment and helpfulness. Comparing with my friends children's teacher from other school, they never experienced as such. I told the teacher to try ensuring my son drinks at least 2 bottle of water a day. They did it by judging from the empty water bottle and my son health. If he didn't drink enough, he will start to cough and his dry lip. However there are times where the teacher couldn't, she would honestly inform me when I fetch him. I appreciate her integrity. To be honest, I felt exhausted just taking care of 1 child and the teachers are taking care of about 15 children per class so how can I blame them for overlooking such trival matter. To me, their principal, Karen is experienced and clear on the objectives of children learning. When I spoke to her on an incident of my son, she could analyze the situation by bringing me to see the full picture and giving me suggestions on what they can commit to avoid the incidents. She is confident in her words that convinced me. I am particular in leader behaviors and attitude where Karen had shown the positive side. I believe a good leader will develop good soldiers. Needn't to say, her suggestion works. My overall experience with the school has been positive. Their way of teaching suit my son well. After all this is a pre-school, I would not expect my son to be sitting on the chair listening and doing homework all day (9hrs?) It will be fun when they learn thru play, presenting their favorite toys to friends etc.. It develop their confidence thru interest. I will recommend friends to this school and it's team. 👍",0.17715367965367967,Topic 5,"['teacher', 'school', 'child', 'kid', 'care', 'good', 'love', 'thank', 'parent', 'principal', 'staff', 'learn', 'son', 'daughter', 'year', 'environment', 'great', 'preschool', 'ms', 'experience']",Small Wonder Preschool (Serangoon)

"Pros: New Cons: Lacking in innovation and un-inclusive; When asked about why parent circulars are only in Mandarin without English translations, the Principal Karen mentioned that that’s how they do it in Learning Vision.

"""I am compelled to share my concerns about Skool4kidz Fernvale Campus, particularly regarding their inconsistent rules and practices in comparison to other campuses. There are notable disparities in rules and practices compared to other campuses like Yishun and Punggol, which allow parents to celebrate birthdays with their children in class. Unfortunately, Fernvale's management lacks consideration for children's well-being by excluding parents from birthday celebrations. This exclusion extends beyond birthdays, as the management seems narrow-minded regarding events and new student inclusion. A recent example was a carnival planned for December 9th, where new students were initially overlooked until I raised the issue. The last-minute RSVP demand by 5 the day of notification is impractical for working parents, showcasing a disregard for their schedules. Moreover, the school's lack of support for breastfeeding mothers is questionable and contradicts government encouragement. Conflicting information about a separate fridge designated for breast milk and medicine storage adds to the confusion. The staff's refusal to assist with one feeding per day due to resource constraints raises concerns and contradicts both government recommendations and the child's well-being. Additionally, misinformation during orientation, lack of timely updates, and administrative inefficiencies, including a staff causing inconvenience with uniform promotions, contribute to an overall unpleasant experience. The campus administration's dismissive attitude towards feedback further adds to the frustration. Overall, my experience with Fernvale Campus has been marked by disappointment and a lack of consideration for the well-being of both students and parents. I hope these issues can be addressed for the benefit of all involved in terms of the school's communication, inclusivity, and support for parents and their children's well-being.",-0.09327094474153297,Topic 2,"['campus', 'diem', 'carpe', 'lack', 'fernvale', 'birthday', 'yishun', 'vicinity', 'mozzie', 'gal', 'treatment', 'consideration', 'contradict', 'add', 'government', 'practice', 'raise', 'stradia', 'settle', 'tan']",Skool4Kidz Campus @ Fernvale

"""Nice teachers and principal they have a great set up. However, it’s not recommended for children who are not Mandarin speaking . My friends child was in Nursery/playgroup and because the class was small so instead of having a English speaking main teacher and a mandarin speaking teacher for mandarin classes as the school originally communicated when signing up , the school had engaged the mandarin teacher to be the main teacher who could not speak a word of English(not even good morning)and this was not communicated to the parents . Unfortunately the parents only noticed this 3-6months in when the child started to show signs of fright to speak because the poor child felt no one understands him in school. The child is now in another school with an English main teacher and the child’s progression in speaking has since improved very well with additional help from enrichment classes to help over come the fear to speak. I believe other upper classes with more students have English main teachers and should have a balance curriculum with both English and mandarin speaking teachers. Just be sure to reiterate the main teachers English speaking when enrolling the child to be able to communicate with your child, as this may cause the child trauma especially at a very young age when they feel no one understands them in school. I hope the school takes this feedback constructive and starts to be transparent on their communication, please be conscious of children in different ethnicities as parents leave their hearts in your trusted hands.",0.14679012345679013,Topic 5,"['teacher', 'school', 'child', 'kid', 'care', 'good', 'love', 'thank', 'parent', 'principal', 'staff', 'learn', 'son', 'daughter', 'year', 'environment', 'great', 'preschool', 'ms', 'experience']",SDM-Moriah Preschool (Greenwich) Pte Ltd

"My son started attending riverlife kindergarten school at 2 years old as pre nursery to n1 and we can really see the big progress. My son have become active from shy type, For a 2 year old he can easily get distracted on the environment but the teachers have patience to teach, he was able to read words which we we didn’t teach as we are busy parents. From there you can really see that the teachers are focusing on every students, not like simply teach and the rest will be on your kid. Teachers really engage the students to be active and to participate on any activities. They teach good values. One of the things that i like most are the videos/ small clips they share weekly for example cooking, reading words, writing letter, drawing, playing as a group/team and so on. These clips really help parents to get an idea on what their kids are up to, I was happy when i saw my son dancing on the videos as he don't usually do at home. As a parent you feel proud and shocked that they can do this. Hope they maintain sending those clips. Principal and teachers are really hands-on as you will notice how they interact with the parents after school. You will see them asking how are things? They even memorize all the names of all the students going in and out. They will also give small feedback / observation to your son to help you understand your kid more. At the end of the term there would be a video call to give the feedback on your kid, The positive feedback and the things to improve on, which is very good. The curriculum on this school is really advance, its like they are two level up on their current level but with no pressure off-course. I have said advance, as due to unfortunate things i needed to move house and move my son to nearby school. Now my son is settled on his new school as n2 and to my surprise, whatever they are teaching here are already been covered in pre nursery of riverlife.

"Rainbow Cove at Alexandra is truly a haven for little ones! Our experience with their infant and child care services has been absolutely exceptional. Both Maevis and Davis have thrived under the loving care of the dedicated staff at Rainbow Cove. Maevis, our eldest, began attending when she was 7 months old, while Davis joined at 2 months old. From the moment we enrolled them, we were impressed by the warmth and professionalism of the team. The children responded with smiles and giggles, and the teachers even went the extra mile to ensure we received pictures of their joyful moments. The caregivers at Rainbow Cove are not just professionals; they are genuine caregivers who create a nurturing and safe environment for the children. Their genuine care is evident in their dedication to each child's well-being and development. One notable example is when Maevis was diagnosed with erb's palsy on her left arm at just 8 months old. I requested the teachers to perform rehabilitation exercises with her, and within a month, Maevis showed significant improvement. its clear to me that the teachers put in the effort for Maevis. Moreover, the facility itself is well-designed and equipped with everything necessary for a child's growth and exploration. The colorful and stimulating environment fosters creativity and learning. Maevis particularly enjoyed riding the trike and playing with friends in the outdoor area. Rainbow Cove is more than just a childcare center; it's a community that values the unique needs of each child. We are immensely grateful to the fantastic team at Rainbow Cove for providing an enriching and loving environment for Maevis and Davis.

"Our baby boy started at Rainbow Cove when he was five and a half months. I worked out a transition plan with the Principal, Ms. Jay, to have his start slowly (in the end of January, before Covid)- only a couple hours a day for three days after Chinese New Year. During those days, I saw that the teachers were all very professional and, above all, they were very passionate. I could clearly witness that taking care of those babies was much more than just a job. After the second day, my new mom jitters were gone. Our baby boy always has a big smile on his face when he gets to school. It has been more than half a year now (with confinement in between) and I feel that I can’t say enough good things about our experience with Rainbow Cove. We are very thankful to all staff. As I said, every teacher, including the principal, is extremely patient, loving and caring. Our son even has a special connection with the auntie who cooks the food and always greets him with an enthusiastic “high five”. Every day children do lots of interesting activities to activate the children’s minds and body. This happened even when we had the lockdown in April/ May. There were online lessons and we were sent activities that children could complete at home. In addition, we are sent pictures and videos via WhatsApp of our babies almost daily. I truly appreciate the time invested in taking those pictures and videos because they make my day at work. Having such close communication with the teachers makes us feel more involved and at ease, reassuring us that our boy is happy, and he is learning new skills with his little friends. At the end of the day when we go and pick our baby, we always get verbal updates too. We also have the daily handwritten personalized booklet to let us know how our son’s day went. Last but not least, Rainbow Cove is very clean and safe. We feel very fortunate to have our son in such environment!

The teachers have been doing a fantastic job, being very patient and helping him develop not just intellectually but in terms of imparting right values as well. I can truly feel that they really care for my child, and it is more than just a job to them. My child really enjoys going to school and looks forward to seeing his teachers and friends every day, and that’s really saying a lot about how good a job they have done.

"My little one started attending N1 at Raffles Kidz @ YCK since early this year and it hasnt been easy for him with this new change of environment and on top of experiencing separation anxiety just like most kids do. However I am grateful we have Teacher Trisha and Xu Laoshi are so gentle and extraordinary patient in helping him to adjust and adapt to new environment. Teacher Trisha and Xu Laoshi will communicate with us frequently how's the progress he can adapt to new environment and socialize with friends. They also gave us a lot of guidance and continuously checking how he is doing after school. Not forget to mention, the Principle and other teachers are also very helpful whenever needed. Sometimes he may not like the daily drop-offs but he certainly is enjoying school once he settled down in class. I also noticed the change in him how he socialized with friends, and impressing us with all the new stuff he learned in school!

"As parents of twins enrolled here for the past 2 years, we would like to commend the teachers for a job well done! Special shoutout to K1 teachers Tessa, Syafiqah, Zhu laoshi and Xing laoshi. We chose the school primarily for its outdoor playground, bilingual Montessori and inquiry-based curriculum and all-encompassing activities included in a single school fee. We also like the fact Raffles Kidz is directly owned and not under a franchise model where profit generation could potentially be an equally or more important factor. It certainly has been a fruitful and happy experience thus far. The teachers are very dedicated and constantly organize many different activities beyond academics to provide a well-rounded education for the children. We really appreciate and are grateful to the teachers in planning for activities such as all festive occasions, field trips and the annual concert, which we know often require time and effort outside the regular curriculum time. Teacher turnover has been relatively low for our kids' class (not an easy achievement in the early childhood industry) and we believe this familiarity sets a good foundation for a child's learning in their early years. Our kids look forward going to school and we see marked improvement in their learning and social skills. In particular, the children love playing with their friends at the playground and the regular water play and cooking sessions.

"Amazing school with very loving teachers who put their heart into nurturing kids' love for learning and life skills (cooking and baking included!). We enrolled since kid was 20mths old and are very appreciative of how they've helped our kid to become a better version of himself. Pedagogy & Curriculum - we were initially attracted to RKI YCK for its bilingual curriculum and large playground. but the school offers way more than that. The pedagogy encourages self-discovery through play, a love for learning, cultivating good life habits & values, and developing an inquisitive mindset. Food - your kid will eat hearty, healthy balanced meals; way better than the typical office workers' meals. Our kid took a liking to fruits thanks to RKI YCK. RKI YCK has a selective hiring process. They've got a great team who take the effort to design and deliver lessons that engage and stimulate the kids way better than tired parents can - by four, they're exposed to discussing current affairs, singing chinese tang poems and songs, and develop an understanding of complex concepts / events through decomposition into simpler ideas. Kid was definitely way less resistant to learning mandarin than I was at his age. Facilities-wise - the school is clean and well maintained kudos to the hardworking support team of chefs and assistants disinfecting and cleaning up after the kids everyday. kids are not the most hygiene-conscious and it is a commendable effort keeping bugs at bay. We like that kids get to enjoy a massive outdoor playground within the compound and continue to play together after school at the park next door. Community is great in RKI YCK and the surrounding neighborhood. If you're driving this is the only school in the nearby estates with a private porch for drop-off. There's also a bus stop nearby.",0.26462481962481965,Topic 5,"['teacher', 'school', 'child', 'kid', 'care', 'good', 'love', 'thank', 'parent', 'principal', 'staff', 'learn', 'son', 'daughter', 'year', 'environment', 'great', 'preschool', 'ms', 'experience']",Raffles Kidz @ Yio Chu Kang

E.g. wiping up his own mess and taking initiative in some simple household chores. The feel of the childcare feels very homely yet systematic. The teachers and principal are very open to communications (prompt reply too). Impressed with their level of dedication and caring attitude towards the kids.

"In 2018, it was our hard decision to send our only son to childcare at 20 months old. We found RKI Punggol and selected this school, believing that our son Haemil will be in good hands. RKI school is a professional preschool and childcare, on what the claim. The program is an excellently balanced work-play schedule, teaching in bilingual, English, and Chinese. As a result, Haemil is always happy coming to school and enjoys his time with teachers and classmates. (And most of the time, he doesn't want to go home). He joined RKI Punggol from PG to K2 (10.12.2022 graduation day). We can see good development in him from year to year. The environment is essential in molding a child's attitude and behavior. A good school with a pleasant atmosphere, professional teachers, and high-standard management must be considered when selecting a preschool for your beloved one. Although I often travel abroad for work, I never worry and often see the updated activities from school apps. RKI constantly improves school programs, which are innovative for new activities, increasing child's exploration. All RKI kids are unique; they grow up well, are intelligent, love each other, and always be happy with their interests. Furthermore, the RKI team always listens to the feedback and is transparent with the parent, improving to a higher standard each year. They also did very well during the crisis of Covid 19. We appreciated and thumbed up for the team. (from management, principal, teachers/laoshi, cleaners, and cookers). My husband and I appreciate your care for the past five years. We thank you for being a good part of his growth from a baby to a boy: Principal Gwen, Yu Laoshi, Tr Emily, and his past teachers: Liu Laoshi, Tr Raye, Tr Jo, Tr Amina, and Han Laosi.

"We have enrolled our child (Pre-Nursery) since Jan 2022 and it has been a great journey. The Principal (Gwen) and Teachers were great and there was clear and open conversation throughout. It took our child about 2 weeks to settle in and soon, going to school was no longer a chore. If you child asks to go to school, you know the school must be doing something right. We also like that there is a playground within the school compound and an area to play with 'cars and bikes'. They also practice quite a bit of common sense and allow snacks to be packed for your child if you have a later pick up time. The teachers were engaging, enthusiastic, friendly and most importantly, able to build rapport with our child quickly. This helped to ease our initial concerns and worries. Whatever our queries, we just had to input it into the e-commsbook and it would be usually answered within a day. Photos were also sent there although we would have loved more photos (what is enough is subjective though 😬). The curriculum has a good mix of outdoor and indoor play. We see quite a bit of arts and craft and hands on experiential learning. We can also see them trying to teach numbers and alphabets. But frankly at this age, we are just happy that she wants to go to school. There were also small thoughtful gestures like rinsing the milk bottles after use so that we will have an easier time cleaning later. A smaller centre also means a little less falling sick and more attention on your child. The only downside is the centre's location in the middle of a private estate so when it rains, it can get quite difficult. The closest LRT station is Punggol Point and it is about a 10 mins walk in. Road closures around the Punggol Road area also means you can only access the centre by Punggol Way (Northshore). So in summary, no complaints or issues with the school thus far. We love the passionate and caring teachers. PS: Special shout outs to Teachers Sankare, Chen Laoshi, Serene, Kat, Yumi, Liu/Yan/Mao Laoshi, Siti, Nabillah, all whom our child often mention at home. Thank you for rendering great care to our child!",0.20596764346764346,Topic 5,"['teacher', 'school', 'child', 'kid', 'care', 'good', 'love', 'thank', 'parent', 'principal', 'staff', 'learn', 'son', 'daughter', 'year', 'environment', 'great', 'preschool', 'ms', 'experience']",Raffles Kidz @ Punggol Ã¢ÂÂ Best Childcare Centre and Preschool

"We enrolled our child since she was 18mth old till 4years old. Best decision that we have ever made in enrolling her to the school! Teacher to students ratio was considered comfortable. The teachers are attentive and quick to update on things. And I adore most on how the teachers care for each child. The school principal also took time to know all the children. It's amazing how they can remember little bits of each child's character and behaviour. The effort in getting parents involve in the children school activities are also commendable as they are always very encouraging. Environment of the school was accessible via public. School curriculum includes outdoor play almost every other depending on weather, which was wonderful because we love our child to play more outdoors. They also include waterplay and cookery lessons which our daughter enjoy immensely. The have quite abit of excursions for the children that do not requires parents to take time off. I guess as working parents, although it wud have been lovely to be there to experience the journey with the children, it was nice not being pressured to take time off from work to go through all the school trips. I understand there are schools that do not allow the child to participate out of school trips if the parents are unable to join. This is good because our child still gets to experience as much out of school education despite our working hours (mind you I do 3 shifts so this was truly appreciated by me). The only few downfalls that we experienced was deductions of school fees and costs for events and trips. We had to multiple times get bounced back and fourth between the school and the bank saying that deduction was unsuccessful despite sufficient value. Ended up paying personally at school almost every month. And the cost to attend graduation concert and some of the outdoor trips is quite steep for preschoolers. All in all, if it was not for MOE kindergarten availability in a school that is 3 minutes walk from our house, we would have continued our child to complete her pre-school journey with Raffles Kidz Punggol.",0.2654947916666667,Topic 5,"['teacher', 'school', 'child', 'kid', 'care', 'good', 'love', 'thank', 'parent', 'principal', 'staff', 'learn', 'son', 'daughter', 'year', 'environment', 'great', 'preschool', 'ms', 'experience']",Raffles Kidz @ Punggol Ã¢ÂÂ Best Childcare Centre and Preschool
"When we first enrolled, our child had a pair of passionate Teachers and the previous Principal was on the ball and you can tell the effort the team puts in. But in 2021, returning after the first wave of covid, we noticed our child’s changed behaviour towards school. The melt down and rejection towards school became more intense. And we noticed that there were lesser books read and the curriculum has been reduced. The new principal’s responses lack lustre and flippant. And it’s obvious our child has been watching screens in school to fill time. Not worth your penny for the lack of activities, child engagement and even basic update from teacher was not frequent enough. Better off sending your child to Govt affiliated pre schools which has more curriculum planning.

"my eldest (now p3) attended and graduated from RKI and had a great issue transitioning into primary school. so I wrote in to BP RKI school and management about my concern hoping that they could attend to my concern as my younger 2 children are also enrolled into the RKI BP. to my dismay, they did not respond to my mail and they also did not provide me with a good and honest feedback about my child's academics. my 2nd child was in k1 last year but was not doing well in her phonics and this was not raised during PTM- I was only informed that my child was doing well and same par as her classmates. but when we attend classes outside of RKI, her standard was significantly lower than her peers. not only that, they increased their price without valid justification. when concern is raised, no response or acknowledgement was given. so had to make a hard decision to withdraw my children (going to K2 and N2 in 2024) which was a really hard choice for my K2. my children had become more vocal and independent after attending the new school (which is cheaper than RKI) for only 2 months, and they can actually come home to tell me in details on the plenty of events what they had done in school for the day. which was a vast difference compared to how they were in RKI. it seemed like they practically did nothing for the day when they were in RKI. for the price that RKI is charging , I'm expecting them to be able to deliver results in my child's holistic growth. but sadly it seems like I had hindered my children growth and made it more difficult for them to transition to primary 1 by sending them to RKI.",0.11585297418630752,Topic 5,"['teacher', 'school', 'child', 'kid', 'care', 'good', 'love', 'thank', 'parent', 'principal', 'staff', 'learn', 'son', 'daughter', 'year', 'environment', 'great', 'preschool', 'ms', 'experience']",Raffles Kidz @ Bukit Panjang Ã¢ÂÂ Best Childcare Centre And Preschool

"We enrolled our son in RKI @ BP in Dec2021 when our son turned 19months old. Initially, we chose RKI because there were no other preschools with vacancies and we thought we'll move him out when we get another preschool with lower school fees. In the end, we decided to stay with RKI for these reasons: 1. Our son shows great improvement in many areas even though he just started less than a year ago. 2. Our son looks forward to go to school everyday now. He only cried for the first couple of days of school. That shows how capable the teachers are to be able to get our son to adapt to a new environment. Our son has mild symptoms of autism so getting him to adapt to a new environment was definitely not easy. 3. The teachers are very prompt in replying to us and are very supportive! Shoutout to Teacher Geri and Meiyu Laoshi. Always updating us on our son's behaviour and learning. 4. We like the curriculum and activities in school too! Especially when we get the photo updates from the teachers every now and then on what they did in school. 5. The monthly newsletter is super helpful for us parents who are working and do not really have the time to chase for updates. We'll get photos and descriptions on what was happening monthly. 6. Almost everyday before our son leaves the school, the principal will always say bye to him and high fived him. It really warm our hearts seeing the principal's action. Thank you Teacher Dee! In conclusion, RKI has gained our trust in not only taking care of our son, but educating him. There are many more reasons but the main ones are these.

I also like the function 'moment' in the app where teachers will take snapshot of what our own kid is doing in class. Currently the curriculum is moving into montessori approach and instead of changing learning theme monthly, it will be quarterly.

During the first month, Teachers would provide updates on my girl every now and then, took photos of her and informed us of any problem or suggestion. The Teachers are responsible, always patient to answer questions and open to suggestions. They are proactive and prompt in informing us on the wellbeing of my girl. Along the way, we are so impressed by the amount of effort that the school put in in preparing teaching materials. For instance, a close to real size milk cow prop for the kids to experience milking. The school adopts thematic teaching and during that month it was about dairy products. Every term, we are informed of the meals menu too. From the food selection, we are again assured that our kids are being well taken care of. The teachers have also done a fantastic job in toilet training. It is really stressless for us parents! The kids are taught useful skills e.g. understand traffic light, road crossing, safety at home etc as young as 2 years old. Parents are informed of learning progress via the monthly bulletin written in bilingual. The school also uses mobile app to maintain comms with parents, including announcement and when kids check in and out of the School with photo evidence. There is also a memory section for Teachers to take precious photos of our child and upload it on the App for our viewing. As a working Mum, bonding time with child can be very limited. Those photos really mean a lot to me at least I get to somehow witness how my child performs in school during my absence. There is an outdoor playground within the school compound. We recognise how important it is for the kids to have space to run around! In fact we are so lucky to have this school near to where we stay in Bukit Panjang.

At first, I was attracted to the school, the space, the facilities and programs. The teachers are very responsive, patient, and professional as well. Teachers to student ratios are always within recommended limits, and sometimes higher ratio for younger age groups. Pre-covid programs/activities included water play, hands-on cookery, excursions, family days, CNY, moon cake festival etc. School approach focuses more on learning through play + manipulatives to achieve age appropriate goals. I like that they break children into smaller focus groups to practice concepts, which is great for children to have more attention from teachers. Older children build a good foundation for primary school. All in all, a school i would recommend to family and friends who are looking for a good preschool in the vicinity.

We were looking to register her for her K1. We had gone thru at least 3 tours in that week and the last one was Raffles Kids International Bukit Panjang. As soon as we entered, there was an assurance and warm response from the teachers (Teacher Zelle) and the principal (Dianne). We registered on the spot without hesitant. And it is worth mentioning that the momentum never ceased all thru her education in this school and even thru the pandemic. All teachers have presented the same pace throughout and they held the space and place in tact to ensure all children and their families are safe. These are highly appreciated. And our daughter calls them heroes of the school. :)",0.15227272727272728,Topic 5,"['teacher', 'school', 'child', 'kid', 'care', 'good', 'love', 'thank', 'parent', 'principal', 'staff', 'learn', 'son', 'daughter', 'year', 'environment', 'great', 'preschool', 'ms', 'experience']",Raffles Kidz @ Bukit Panjang Ã¢ÂÂ Best Childcare Centre And Preschool
"One of the best decisions we have made for our first child . He attended school when he was 26months, one thing that we noticed, he is always happy to go to school Everyday ! That itself speaks volume and the dedicadion / effort that the Principal and Teachers are putting in. We all know the draggy feeling or when the little ones cry out loud not wanting to change to into their school uniform, let alone go to school. Teachers are always caring / courteous and smiling, the vibes and feeling given to the little school goers are right and happy mood before they even started class/lessons. Teachers are well qualified and knowledgeable (billingual). Facilities wise , was one of our criteria as , they have their own play area / garden / playground (under the sun) within their compound (fenced), other schools are utilising public playgrounds etc so security and germs was one of our main priority . And the school will always try to organise activity or events to involve the whole family .

"This is a private child care centre which has its own outdoor play area. The dining area resides at the back of the two terrace houses that the school occupies (divider wall torn down) and the children won't be in aircon all day long (personally likes this as this lowers the chances of viruses being spread easily - as compared to being in aircon all day). The children will dine in their respective classrooms during periods such as haze. Children are grouped into the various levels e.g. Pre-nursery & N1, N2, K1 & K2 and placed into different parts of the two terraces (classrooms). I like this arrangement so that the contact between children is minimized (apart for morning assembly and after 5pm) and this would minimize the spreading of virus too. The teachers are patient and nice. I like how updates are provided to parents promptly so that teachers and parents could work with each other for the children's development. The launch of the school app this year was one of the best improvements. With this app, we get updates when our children checked in and out of school and also communication is made easier between the school and parents. We are also updated via the app on our children's development. The school made some changes to the curriculum from this quarter, introducing Montessori-style type of teaching. Hope to see greater improvement to our child's learning with this change. We have seen great process and development in our child from the start last year. Would recommend for parents to place their children in the school. ◡̈",0.2119281045751634,Topic 5,"['teacher', 'school', 'child', 'kid', 'care', 'good', 'love', 'thank', 'parent', 'principal', 'staff', 'learn', 'son', 'daughter', 'year', 'environment', 'great', 'preschool', 'ms', 'experience']",Raffles Kidz @ Bukit Panjang Ã¢ÂÂ Best Childcare Centre And Preschool
"We started sending our little one to RKI@Bt Pjg when he turned 31 months. The school was under renovation at that time but we saw much potential from it and was also attracted by the lovely outdoor play area. One of the practices unique to the school was they didn’t allow parents’ accompaniment even on the first day. We felt really unsettled with this restriction but with the teachers assuring us how successful it had been with other children we decided to give it a try. Turned out it worked well with our child. We were especially fond of the Comm Book feature in the app on which you can communicate with the teachers directly. During the first two weeks, the attending teachers have been dedicatedly updating us with pictures and progress which gave us lots of relief. Another thing we really like from the operation aspect is, they observe stringent pupil+parent/authorised personnel check-in/check-out procedures. Although it seemed a little cumbersome, we don’t mind going through it knowing that the security of the school would never be compromised. What would be perfect is for the school to be openly showing how the curriculum is conducted. Given that our child is not yet descriptive about the activities in school, we could only depend on the weekly updates to visualise the bits and pieces of it. Although our child comes back happy and is not resistant of school everyday, we hope there could be some reasonable platforms for us to see the how the curriculum is conducted.",0.19624999999999998,Topic 5,"['teacher', 'school', 'child', 'kid', 'care', 'good', 'love', 'thank', 'parent', 'principal', 'staff', 'learn', 'son', 'daughter', 'year', 'environment', 'great', 'preschool', 'ms', 'experience']",Raffles Kidz @ Bukit Panjang Ã¢ÂÂ Best Childcare Centre And Preschool

"Dear Farah & Staff of Raffles Kidz@AMK, I am writing to express my heartfelt appreciation for the commendable work, love & care that you have showered upon my daughter. Since my daughter joined your center in June 2023, I have witnessed a tremendous positive impact on her development and growth. The dedication and passion exhibited by your staff have been truly commendable. I often hear my daughter recounting her daily activities, interactions she experienced with her teachers and classmates, over dinner. This is testimony that my daughter is fully engaged and enjoying school. Additionally, the way that my girl dashes to her teachers for morning hugs (on occasions when I was able to send her to school) is sheer evidence that duty of care and rapport building on the part of your teachers is strong. This certainly contributed to my daughter's happiness and positive learning experience. The curriculum and activities provided at your center have not only been educational but also engaging. The diverse range of activities, coupled with the attention to each child's individual needs, has impressed me. The progress I have seen in my daughter's social skills, creativity, and basic motor skills is a testament to the quality of education she is receiving. Thank you for the regular updates of the activities and programmes that my daughter experiences everyday through the communication app. My wife and myself never fail to exclaim in excitement while browsing the photographs and videos that your teachers post every weekend. I must say that the cleanliness and safety measures implemented within the center have provided me with peace of mind, knowing that my daughter is in a secure, safe and hygienic environment. My wife and I are appreciative of the wonderful community you have built, where children enjoy the school experience, are encouraged to learn, explore, and make friends. Your team's efforts are commendable under your leadership, and I cannot thank you and your teachers enough for all the care and love you give to my duaghter and your little charges.

"Raffles Kidz ticks everything on my checklist for an ideal childcare preschool for my daughter. The top on my list is a school with bilingual curriculum. The most significant change we’ve noticed is our daughter’s improvement in Chinese. Having being away from Singapore and residing in a non-Chinese speaking country for more than 2 years, my daughter has lost out a lot on formal Chinese lessons. RKI’s immersive learning environment where teachers carry out conversations in both languages paves the way for children to become effectively bilingual. In fact, just within 5 weeks at RKI, my child could speak to us in simple Mandarin sentences when in the past, she couldn’t and wouldn’t. She is also more proactive in speaking and writing Chinese now. Readiness for primary school, yet not being overly academic focus is another factor I look for in a good preschool. RKI’s holistic development nurtures the whole child with an inquiry-based Montessori approach. Enrichment such as Creative Arts, Science & Discovery, Gourmet Chef, and Chinese Speech and Drama are all part of the curriculum and school fees. During the school tour, I was bowled over by the clean and vibrant environment as well as the facilities. My daughter loves the school so much that she readily went away with the teacher to be engaged in various activities. She also chose this school even though it was only our first school visit of the day. This shows how comfortable she is with the teachers and environment. Another factor I like is that the school is centrally managed and not a franchise. This to me is really important as I can be assured of the quality no matter which branch. My daughter enjoys going to school a lot. She likes all her teachers and friends. She comes home with tummy well fed and mind well stretched, sharing with me General Knowledge and current affairs. 3 months in this school and I’m impressed by how much she has blossomed.",0.25318627450980397,Topic 5,"['teacher', 'school', 'child', 'kid', 'care', 'good', 'love', 'thank', 'parent', 'principal', 'staff', 'learn', 'son', 'daughter', 'year', 'environment', 'great', 'preschool', 'ms', 'experience']",Raffles Kidz @ Ang Mo Kio Ã¢ÂÂ Best Childcare Centre and Preschool (along Yio Chu Kang Rd)

The teachers really care about the children, and go over and beyond to bring out the best in the children 2. Truly a place where children learn and discover through play 3. Authenticity in their approach. It isn’t about fancy facilities/ toys. The teachers are incredibly resourceful and love using natural materials and recycled materials as toys, learning tools and props. 4. They teach the kids about sustainability and the environment. Their actions speak louder than words, eg bringing in a company to teach kids how to recycle water in the garden, engaging with a company that has sensors/equipment to “talk to trees”, and moving away from parent-packed snacks to reduce the use of plastic wrappers + inculcate healthier snacks ie fruits provided by the school . 5. Good balance between being play based, but still having an effective method for teaching (eg Spalding for reading) to prep the kids for “big school” 6. Super collaborative with parents.They are very open to addressing any issues that we as parents have. Parents are welcomed to come into school and see what their kids are up to.

"When we step in, we could see that the place is newly renovated, bright, airy, gives a cosy vibe & conducive for learning. This helps break away from the school setting that our son is accustomed to in the morning. With a change in setting, the environment mentally engages his mind and relaxes him, which is a good alternative to home. We like that there is a structured curriculum in place where the teachers provide guidance on his homework and drill him on spellings. There is also focus on each subject a day where worksheets are provided to deepen their understanding. Not to mention, Fridays where he is empowered to do things that interests him like art & craft or just unwinding for the weekend. On top of this, there is paid for enrichment classes conveniently provided under the same roof. This include robotics and maths that we do not need to locate elsewhere. Our son likes the reading corner and enjoys engaging in puzzles with his peers such as Jig saw, Tangram, Pentomino, Sudoko & others. This center goes beyond the basic looking after your child (e.g. relief teacher) but enriches him academically, socially and holistically as it bridges general knowledge of what is happening around us through holiday programs. It does not disconnect him from the world we live in but provide insights and practical activities that could be as simple as folding plastic bags! With the strong program and purpose that it brings, it makes it easier for us to give our son a more balanced childhood as school related work is mainly settled during weekdays while weekends are reserved for sports, leisure & family time.

"""I’m super thankful for the exceptional early childhood education provided by Picket Fence @ Tampines. The teachers here are not just professionals; they embody a genuine love for children that truly shines through in everything they do. From the moment my child stepped into their care, I knew he was in nurturing hands. One of the things that sets this school apart is their dedication to keeping parents well-informed about their child's progress. The regular updates we receive about our son's development and how he's faring in school give us immense peace of mind. It's reassuring to know that the teachers are not only invested in the academic aspect but also in the holistic growth of each child.

"""I was initially excited when I called this particular centre and when they told me that they had vacancy. The excitement quickly dwindled once I began the assessment process. I mentioned that my daughter has a speed delay issue and the energy from the centre became less welcoming once I disclosed the information. We were quite surprise with the response we received, as it is important for any educational centre to cater to the needs of their students, regardless of their learning differences. Furthermore, I was asked to provide a full report from a specialist at KKH. While this may have been necessary for their assessment process, it added to the time and effort required on my end. Lastly, the lack of communication and delayed response from the centre regarding the status of my application was disappointing. It seems that the principal was the only person who could make the decision and unfortunately, was unavailable due to illness (couple of weeks). However, it would have been more professional if someone else from the centre had been able to provide updates on the status of my application in a timely manner. I still feel that the lack of response and the unwelcoming energy from the principle, this particular centre will not take kids less than normal.

There is a library, a music room and an art room. The best quality of Odyssey are the teachers. They take good care of the children, pay great attention to details and understands the children. I have learnt a great deal from them on how to handle the children's emotion and growth. The curriculum is well thought out. There are regular parent teachers conferences, cirriculumn tea and plenty of updates each week. You always know what is happening. They also take our feedbacks seriously. When my girl had trouble adapting to school at first, the principal and teachers took effort to ease the transition. There are plenty of events all year round. Library visit, park visits, museum visit, Colors of Odyssey, Mother's and Father's day, Chinese revival, Odyssey Games. The children enjoys school a lot. Sometimes it's hard to get them to leave. Great school and awesome experience.",0.2697368421052631,Topic 5,"['teacher', 'school', 'child', 'kid', 'care', 'good', 'love', 'thank', 'parent', 'principal', 'staff', 'learn', 'son', 'daughter', 'year', 'environment', 'great', 'preschool', 'ms', 'experience']",Odyssey The Global Preschool Pte Ltd (Loyang Besar)

"My first experienced with Odyssey Loyang was when I registered my eldest in 2014. This outlet does not cater for infant class. So the earliest age to be registered for this outlet is when the child is 18 months old. The ratio between child and teacher is good. The teachers are good as they really know how to calm children down, interact with the kids, get them to be involved in the daily activities. They have lots of fun activities incorporated while learning. So it won’t be just a dull time of just studying and reading. They have water play, sand play, ALI walk to the beach which is like 10 mins walk to the Pasir Ris beach. Their breakfast, lunch and snacks are well prepared by their in-house chef. It’s healthy, clean and the ingredients are from halal sourced. They do have school bus service if you need someone to ferry your kids to this school. Most importantly, 3 of my children enjoyed going to this school. They learned a lot of IQ and EQ knowledge. Thank you for the years that you’ve been with my children.

"My older child cried for 6 months straight at drop off and the school reassured me that he would stop crying as soon as he entered the classroom. This was admit Covid where the parents were not allowed a step beyond the school gate let alone the classroom. So I believed the school and believed the fact this is the most reputable nursery brand on this island. Until one day I chatted with the class teacher when she said to me “ which child likes to go to school like which adult likes to go to work” and “your son wouldn’t stop crying so I told him I’ll never talk to him again if he doesn’t stop” in these literal words in Chinese. There were two teachers one English speaking and one Chinese each class and each teacher gave opposing feedback. This glorified bi-lingual system also meant in my case some sort of feud between the two of them with complaints regarding unequal pay and treatment from the school ! This feud was so obvious when 6 months later I was finally able to sit in one of the classes. I decided to open up and say something upon seeing the viral video of child abuse at a Woodlands nursery recently. When your child is unable to communicate clearly and refuses to go to school there is a reason and I regret not believing in my child from the beginning.

"I was most fortunate to do my practicum placement at Nurtured Nest Preschool for 1 month in the capacity of a teacher-in-training while I was pursuing my diploma in Early Childhood Care and Education. The team of teachers are passionate for the children’s learning, social emotional well-being, and most importantly— FUN! The activities organised for the children are catered to their interests and needs, and are very much authentic learning experiences which engage the children’s 5 senses, and gives them plenty of opportunities to play and work with one another in the great outdoors. It is not your typical preschool where children are forced to sit down and listen to a static, academic lesson from a whiteboard, but instead a play-based school where they are fully immersed and engaged in their learning. Children spend lots of time getting messy and dirty in the sand and rain (with raincoats and boots of course!), creating masterful artworks with paint and loose parts and glue, or simply just having a picnic in the grass patch behind the school. This is not just a great school for young children, but for any potential practicum students who are looking for a unique, vibrant, and out-of-the-norm preschool as an attachment centre.

We value outdoor time for our child and NN provides lots of this during the day, sometimes even when it rains (the children are required to have raincoats and boots). We also resonate with the Reggio Emilia approach which the school follows.

Little did I know she was already serving her notice period but still that was very unprofessional of her to push the blame to the kids for rejecting proper first aid care. Parents was not informed as well until I discovered the wound myself. I escalated to HQ and originally they said the sch ( which is the P) will take it up but I was furious that they didn’t wan to take up the case themselves as ultimately we go to HQ for a reason , because the P wasn’t able to handle parents concerns and feedback well.

"As a working mum, it can get difficult at times to juggle the load between work commitments and child care. Enrolling both my children in MFS-RVC has been one of the best choices we have made. It was an intimidating and teary moment to place my firstborn in infant care from the young age of 4 months. With Chen Laoshi's kind reassurance and over time, seeing him thrive in school has put my heart at ease and the decision to also place my 2nd child in infant care was an easy one to make. The teachers at Infant care, Chen Laoshi, Teacher Heeda, Teacher Jenny, treat the children as if their own. It's a joy to see the teachers are always in high spirits, enthusiastically welcoming the children during drop off. When my younger child was unwell and hadn't been to school, Teacher Heeda makes the effort to constantly follow up on her well being even after working hours. This is a testament to how much genuine care the teachers have for the little ones. In terms of curriculum, infants explore activities through sensory play that enhances their listening, language and psychomotor skills. Most of the teaching materials are very creative and often hand made by the teachers themselves through recycled materials. Besides sensory play, teachers also help guide the little ones through tummy time, learning to sit, crawl and walk. They also encourage infants to self-feed, put on shoes, wash hands etc at the age-appropriate juncture. My young one is currently doing very well in the care of these experienced, qualified and most importantly, loving teachers. Toddlerhood was a tough phase for my elder son who was having difficulty coping with his big emotions. I am grateful to Teacher Joyce for going the extra mile, to sit with him every evening before pick up to walk him through and sort out these feelings. The teacher-child bond is so strong, my child would even mistakenly call me Teacher Joyce at times! He would also always say he misses her. Dealing with a threenager is difficult. Dealing with a whole class of them calls for utmost patience and dedication, kudos to Teacher Joyce and Liu Laoshi! It was a drastic change for my elder son to graduate from PG to Nursery this year. Here, independence is strongly encouraged in preparation for Primary school. Children will learn to go to the toilet, clean up after themselves and learn to communicate their wants and needs. They do well in fostering the children's curiosity and also build up my son's confidence for public speaking through ""Show and Tell"". Many thanks to Teacher Joycelyn and Lei Laoshi for the well structured, creative and enjoyable lessons. My elder child especially loves the lesson on the 3R's and also listening walk, and would request to do the same at home. Through their patient guidance, we can see improvement in our child's speech and confidence. Beyond the day to day classroom curriculum, the centre also offers optional age-appropriate music/ abacus/ science etc enrichment lessons in the evening. This is helpful for parents with time constraints for weekend enrichment classes. MFS-RVC is not just a school, in a way, it's like an extended family. The Principal and teachers are extremely supportive, always willing to share good advice when needed. When we were having a hard time deciding the next path for our child, Ms Angela generously spent an hour out of her busy schedule to speak to us, providing us with her unbiased, useful advice. Our children spend most of their time in school and finding them the right one is paramount.

"A mega childcare centre with warm, dedicated and patient principal, teachers and support staffs. Each of them played a critical role in helping our children to adjust, adapt and enjoy their preschool experiences. It is highly commendable as the staffs will consistently make conscientious effort to identify and memorise the name of every child at the centre. Activities and celebrations are also frequently held for the children to help them to understand the origins of each festivals and foster a senses of what they should value in their lives. The publications of the activities album are helpful for parents to know and understand the learning phase of their children as well. The location, standalone building as well as the comprehensive range of facilities available have also enabled the children to learn, play and grow uninterrupted. Hope to see the organising of external excursions (e.g. to the farms, etc) for the children/and parents to mingle and share their experiences of parenting.

The screening teachers (teacher Faa, Priya & Cheng) are always so patient and smiley, even with the crying kiddos. Our son's English and Chinese teachers (Teacher Jed & Zhou laoshi) are like gems and deserve a superhero cape - super patient, caring, and passionate about their job. Taking care of so many kids sounds like a tough gig, but they handle it like pros (I observed during 1st day orientation & field trip)! Our son was new to the school and we constantly witnessed the teachers went the extra miles to make him settle in, the dedication and thoughtfulness really touch our hearts! ✨ And a big shout-out to the new teachers (Teacher Kriz & Lili laoshi) - so kind when our little one leveled up to a new class and environment. Constantly providing updates and assurance really help make us feel confident about the changes. Just less than a year with MFS, our son's leaps and bounds of improvement, coupled with the stories he brings home daily, speak volumes about the fantastic learning experience at My First Skool.

Teachers share with us any new milestones like when she talked much more than usual and also cares for her safety and well being. She's also very happy in class and loves to read books, sing and dance to songs that she learnt in school.

"""Often, hear teachers from 443D and 443C scolding the kids loudly. Especially 1 Indian teacher. Saw the Indian teacher, scolding the kids loudly a few times. 1 time, I saw her scolding a 3 year old boy so loudly until it could be heard like 5 to 7 meters away(really loud). She called the boy to stand in front of her, and she shouted right at the small boy. The boy was quiet and seen nodding his head softly. Is this how you deal with kids? Are you being trained to treat kids that way? So unacceptable, very² rude. If you have no patience, then you are not fit to be a pre-school teacher. You don't treat kids that way. Even to a grown-up kid, we don't embarrass people that way. A Chinese teacher who was there with the Indian teacher was just watching and didn't do anything to stop the Indian teacher. When a few passersby stood outside the class to see them, only then the Chinese teacher signaled the Indian teacher to stop and to look out the window at us.

"""My son was enrolled into the toddler relation group earlier this year and to date I am very pleased with the center's service. The curriculum is well structured with both English and Chinese languages, which expose my son into variety of activities that develop all kinds of skills he needs at this age. Particularly he is very excited about the classes related to music and motion which he sometimes even practices after school at home. The communication with the school and teachers is superb. The APP regularly updates the activities of the kids (with photos) which let the parents have the sense of what the kids are playing at school. Announcement are also timely updated through the APP as well. Further, the center and teachers sent regular emails (e.g., monthly kids update) with more information and suggestions for your kid. What I like most is that the teachers call the parents frequently (2-3 times per week) during kids' nap time to further communicate with the parent verbally, and you also have the chance to talk to teachers when you fetch the kid almost everyday.

"This childcare centre by MFS is a hidden gem. My elder boy entered the centre halfway in K1 (in 2019) and the teachers (Luo Laoshi & Teacher Ram) did a great job to assimilate him and encouraged the other children to engage him. For a boy who cried daily at drop off in his previous school, we were prepared that he'll cry again, but to our surprise, he didn't cry at all during this transition and thereafter, enjoyed going to sch daily until he graduated last year. My younger child now has the same privilege to be cared for by the same team of dedicated teachers (Luo Laoshi, Teacher Ram & Teacher Kavitha). Curriculum wise, I had my concerns initially like most parents - shd I pay more for better academic focus? That's always the scale that most parents would weigh, but my concerns were allayed as I've come to realize that MFS is a good balance of both affordability and quality. My elder boy enjoyed learning through the various inquiry projects - there would be different themes each term and the teachers put in a lot of effort to pique children's curiosity via hands-on activity, parent engagement, relation to current affairs and relevance to primary school. The teachers also took many pictures of my child in action and I can easily view the pictures weekly in the parents portal to see what they've learned in school. My boy excelled under this system and is now doing well in primary school with strong foundation set during the 2 yrs of his time in MFS. Apart from its team of caring and competent teachers, the centre's layout is also a plus point. The classes are split into 3 different bays around blk 258/260, so cases of hfmd, and even covid were kept to a minimal. Many parents who sent their children to this centre also echo my same view and thus I'd not hesitate to recommend this centre to my family, neighbours and friends.",0.23259803921568634,Topic 5,"['teacher', 'school', 'child', 'kid', 'care', 'good', 'love', 'thank', 'parent', 'principal', 'staff', 'learn', 'son', 'daughter', 'year', 'environment', 'great', 'preschool', 'ms', 'experience']",My First Skool (260 Bukit Batok East Ave 4)

His communication book is also filled with pictures with description of what has been done in school. I am glad that that my son has learnt a lot and is an independent and responsible boy. We can see his growth (cognitive and affective) and hope he continues to develop his leadership skills in school (like he was given opportunties to be buddy eith new comers etc). Work is not overload (they are homework sometimes as form of parental bonding) and there are also additional Saturday zoom classes for both parents and pupils. His teachers are also patience yet strict and ensured that the right values are taught to the children. It was clearly eveident when my boy had a few tantrums/incidents with friends and teachers are there to guide them to solve the issues. During PTMs, teachers are also truthful (sound out both postive and negative behaviours and seek ways to help my boy to improve.

The assessments that the teachers made for our children’s development had given us better perspective in guiding our children to learn through play according to their learning style.

The centre greatly encourages parental involvement through school trips, festive celebrations as well as DIY craft homework from time to time, which we enjoyed being part of.

"""We have been blessed to have fantastic teachers for both our kids in Mulberry Tanjong Pagar branch. As other reviews can attest for quality, I shall highlight other aspects of the school/centre. The school operates very much like a family-centric centre; by that, I mean how closely-knitted the staff and teachers are both as professional and friends; This is an important aspect that most people don't pay attention to. A vibrant, positive, happy work place will influence how the children in-turn get influenced on their daily-interaction and learning journey. The children formed very strong bonds with their teachers, through the similar staff-to-staff positive relationship they have fostered over the years. The bonds from teachers-and-children, are one of many layers: bonds of respect and authority (as caregivers, educators) to bonds of friendship (where the children see their teachers as their best friend and someone they can safely confide in during the school hours). We have been to a few different pre-schools across our 2 children's early-childhood years; and I can say that a school/centre that doesn't have the above as a strong bond, operates very loosely as a school that functions as ""just a salaried employee"". Tanjong Pagar Mulberry's teachers are always a mile or two beyond what they are required to do. During some of the parent-volunteer work, I have personally witnessed how the teachers manage the kids, how the kids look-up to their teachers from celebrating moments of happiness, to confiding in sadness shows a lot about their bonds forged. Definitely joyful place to grow up at.",0.23661515151515153,Topic 5,"['teacher', 'school', 'child', 'kid', 'care', 'good', 'love', 'thank', 'parent', 'principal', 'staff', 'learn', 'son', 'daughter', 'year', 'environment', 'great', 'preschool', 'ms', 'experience']",Mulberry Learning Centre @ Tanjong Pagar Pte Ltd

"Only if I can give negative stars. We registered our child into this NEWLY opened IFC at tanjong pagar (yes due to location, the fees are not cheap at all). My child was the pioneer batch and there were only 3 infants to start with. So our story with mulberry IFC goes... My child was admitted to hospital after her first week in a newly opened IFC, being diagnosed with herpangina. My child just turned 4mo. On top of the every-other-monthly sickness of cough and flu, my child had stomach flu at least 3 times in between. With the persistent watery stool, it caused her skin to break down. My child was experiencing intense pain and requires saline wash, because the broken skin just can't tolerate tap water and cotton balls. Ultimately requiring antibiotics (oral and topical for the bum). We gave instructions very clearly and even taught the main educarer multiple times on the application of diaper cream. Somehow redness can still develop over her private part all the way to her bum. Every weekend I have to nurse her skin back to normal. And yes, they significantly improved with the diaper cream. After giving them a clean healthy bum skin for the week, I receive red skin for the weekends again. 7 months into ifc, my child had another episode of herpangina. And it has to fall on her 1st birthday party. All in all, throughout her attendance from Sep 2022 - Jul 2023, a total of 11 months, my child had a total of 2 herpanginia episodes. The 2nd one was an outbreak and the school was asked to close by MOH (yes it was THAT serious). This shows enough right? The last straw was the principal, Ms Lee. I'd describe her as inexperience with poor insight and management. Though she's polite and trying to portray a professional front, but you can feel that it's all fake. We requested for a spot at PG when we entered our child into IFC. We were also promised that we will be given priority, just need to remind them again when my child turns 15mo. That's when the school will prepare the child for transition. At 13mo, we went to have a chat with Ms Lee, asking more about PG classes, the fees and subsidy etc. It was an incidental finding... As we were then told that there's no space for my child, and this will be it even till the following year. The principle put the blame on us saying that it is our duty to let them know if we wanted a spot (didn't we before we confirm our child into your IFC? We even have prove of the conversation.) So much for giving my child priority. And even when the spots are filling up before she turns 15mo, the school did not ask if we would like to reserve a space. And to shock us further, some students who entered IFC after my child, had gotten themselves a spot at PG. The principle claimed that the parents went to her to request for it. So my question was how do they know to approach the school and reserve a PG spot even before their own child turns 15mo (if that's the rule set by the school)? The whole conversation with Ms Lee, there were no apology, no sense of remorse, whatsoever. All she said was 'there's definitely lapses', 'we will do better', 'we will improve'. To think about it, if we didn't look her up wanting to know more about PG curriculum and fees etc, we probably wouldn't know there's no spot up till my child really turns 18mo. We have to go through the whole process of finding a preschool for our child, shortlisting them, taking out time from work to attend school tours. This has caused soooooooo much inconvenience at our end, just because of their terribly poor management. Think again before you send ur child to this one here.",0.06839345839345841,Topic 5,"['teacher', 'school', 'child', 'kid', 'care', 'good', 'love', 'thank', 'parent', 'principal', 'staff', 'learn', 'son', 'daughter', 'year', 'environment', 'great', 'preschool', 'ms', 'experience']",Mulberry Learning Centre @ Tanjong Pagar Pte Ltd

I asked who ""they"" are, she then said ""they"" is the centre principal, who just texted her to say whole of that day cannot tour the centre.

We believe that the kids should ‘play’ a lot and that school is meant to be fun for the kids. So MindChamps fits the bill as the curriculum is very structured, with a good balance between academic and non-academic aspects.

"This is the fifth year that we have been working with Mindchamps day and night. My two sons graduated here respectively. I am very grateful to Mindchamps for accompanying my children, and I am also grateful to myself for making the most suitable choice for my children at the right time. The school has a strong teaching system and teachers have great teaching ambitions. They spend every bit of time to give the children the best possible enlightenment, from imparting knowledge and culture to taking care of them between meals and classes. They lead by example and strive for excellence. The results of their words and deeds can be clearly seen in the lives of the children. For us, what is particularly worth mentioning is the progress of the children’s Chinese language. I believe that many Chinese families have similar troubles, and there are certain deficiencies in the Chinese language in an English-speaking environment. Listening, speaking, reading and writing are a very important language development period between the ages of 3 and 6.

"""Wonderful preschool! As a working mum, the staff and teachers at Mindchamps CBP make it so easy for me to juggle work commitments without having to worry about my child's well being and development. Perfect outdoor and indoor location where kids have a dedicated area for waterplay and their own playground! This was important to us as we wanted our child to spend time in the sun too! Teachers also incorporated learning in the outdoor play to help kids to truly understand concepts. Teachers are prompt in responding to parents and always see themselves as a team with parents. This is a wonderful way of raising kids. In PG and Nursery, the focus is very much on social skills and interacting well with others while still keeping up with academic developments. In kindergarten, teachers focus on building independence with the kids and preparing them for primary school. Mindchamps CBP also has drama, ballet and music classes so kids are kept actively engaged in their interests. Food menus are shared with parents in advanced so you know what your kids are being fed.

The outdoor space also doubles up as learning venue for a different kind of exposure and learning experience for the kids. The Mindchamps programmes are very interesting and we appreciate that they encourage exploratory learning with the kids. Themes are set through each term with activities focusing around the various themes. Lessons as I hear from our child are interesting, lively and very enjoyable. It’s a brilliant way for young minds to learn. Kudos to the teachers for always going the extra mile to creatively impart knowledge. Feedback from us parents are taken seriously and always addressed promptly which is something we appreciate a lot. Parent teacher conferences are held periodically on top of the updates we get on our child. This is always welcomed - afterall it is a partnership between us parents and teachers.

Our experience with the school, has been nothing but amazing- right from highlighting details about the child’s progress and potential, to encouraging the child with patience every step of the way-the teachers have always had and have ‘the child first’ policy. Aside the learning and thinking skills imparted, when combined with dance and drama (also an integrated part of the curriculum), truly ensures that the child is blossoming comprehensively- and what’s more, these are not empty words- we can vouch as a first hand experience of this with our child :). Asides this, what we also really like about the infrastructure/ space of this school - is that unlike a few other preschools which are located in malls etc- this one has a playground- which is really great as the kids can get to be in a more “natural” environment while the teachers oversee all the play activities. Finally, a very important factor in considering MindChamps CBP has always been how welcoming, engaged and receptive the whole team is right from the start- they always allays any concerns and address any questions the parents may have and this give us the confidence to know that our child is in a safe and conducive environment geared for growth.",0.27981203007518796,Topic 5,"['teacher', 'school', 'child', 'kid', 'care', 'good', 'love', 'thank', 'parent', 'principal', 'staff', 'learn', 'son', 'daughter', 'year', 'environment', 'great', 'preschool', 'ms', 'experience']",MindChamps Performing Arts PreSchool @ Changi Business Park

"Having been in a total English-speaking environment for first 4.5 years of their lives, my twins hardly knew any Chinese when they first started K1 at MindChamps Chinese Preschool, Tampines. At the beginning, it was difficult as the environment, the routine and the language were completely new to them. However, thanks to the teachers who have been very patient and encouraging, they both settled in quickly. They also showed great improvement in understanding, speaking and writing Chinese after just a few months. I like that the learning themes are the same for both English and Chinese lessons so they get to learn about a topic in two different languages. Rather than overlapping, the English and Chinese lessons actually complement each other. That is a brilliant way for children to pick up words in the language they are weaker in. My twins are now more confident about Chinese, in fact, they have started to speak the language voluntarily and often share with me enthusiastically the new words they learnt. We can tell from the lesson contents and teaching materials that the teachers put in a lot of effort to engage the children. Together with the support staff, they set a cheerful, positive ambience where children can grow and develop to their full potential without fear. After all, children should feel joy in learning. I am glad we found the right school for them.",0.16624649859943977,Topic 5,"['teacher', 'school', 'child', 'kid', 'care', 'good', 'love', 'thank', 'parent', 'principal', 'staff', 'learn', 'son', 'daughter', 'year', 'environment', 'great', 'preschool', 'ms', 'experience']",MindChamps Chinese PreSchool @ Tampines Central
"“小脚,小脚踏踏，我的双脚跳起来！小手,小手拍拍，我的小手举起来！小手,小手拍拍，我的小手藏起来！手在哪里？手在哪里？在这里！” This is what my 3 year-old daughter Megan teaches me lately in the evening with lots of giggles and smiles. When a child comes home and she is so eager to share with you what she has learnt in school, it just means that she is having so much fun and she wants to share the joy with us! As a parent and a teacher, I am so heartened to see this sight every evening. The curriculum in MindChamps Chinese Preschool @ Tampines Central is so robust and fun that I always look forward to the weekly updates by teachers. Even my family and friends commented that the children in this school are so fortunate as the school has such engaging activities that nurture all aspects of a child during the early years. And I couldn’t agree more. I especially like the Gourment Moments where children are given the opportunities to observe and discuss about food while they are taken through the steps to create simple, healthy dishes. Just recently, Megan has asked if we can make Tacos at home and she went on to tell us what are the ingredients we need and the steps in making Tacos. She has also initiated to help us in our cooking nowadays. It is evident that all the activities in school has built her confidence. I would also like to take this opportunity to commend on the team of dedicated teachers that MindChamps Chinese Preschool @ Tampines Central has. 邱老师 always goes the extra miles to listen to my concerns and give me constructive feedback and timely updates on Megan’s progress. As a teacher myself, I know it is not easy for teachers to give the dedicated time and attention to parents and addressing to our concerns. And I am really appreciative of her efforts. I would also like to thank 张老师、Teacher Jamie and Ms Andrea for their patience and love for Megan. All the teachers and leaders have played an important role in Megan’s learning .

"We could not be happier with our choice of preschool. Our Son, Julien, started attending N1 at Mindchamps Chinese Preschool early in the school year - their unique curriculum placing emphasis in mandarin during the early years of childhood learning was one of the key reasons why we chose to send Julien there. Fast forward 9 months, Julien has since flourished and has had an incredible year. He has made many new friends, experienced and learned many new and exciting things. His teachers has been wonderful in providing us updates and constant feedback as well as making Julien feel secure and confident. From having zero knowledge in mandarin, Julien is now able to understand, converse in basic mandarin and also sing mandarin folks songs!

As perhaps the best testament to the school’s success, Zachary tells us that he “super loves” school and looks forward to going to school “everyday, even on weekends” because he can “learn a lot of things”.

"Coming from English speaking family, my son has picked up quite alot of mandarin words since he started PG few months ago and uses them regularly at home. One afternoon he ran up to me and said ‘Mommy, wo ai nie’. That was his first sentence in mandarin at 21months old. Days later he came up to me on the bed and said ‘qi lai’ while pulling my hand. It was always a pleasant surprise each time he said something in mandarin but mainly, im impressed he knew how to apply them. In my opinion, the teachers have done well in teaching the kids not just the words but the right application as well.

"My elder girl started school at Mindchamps Chinese Preschool @ Tampines Central as a N1 Champ and is now into her 4th year in K2. Our precious little girl will be graduating very soon, which is such a poignant moment. She has grown up so much over the last 4 years! From a shy little girl who cannot even go up and down the steps properly to now where she can speak confidently and has her own mind; overcoming her fear of slides; and even taking great care of her little sister who is now in the N1 class, she has blossomed into a young little lady. Her change has been amazing. We recall the days when she could not even hold her scissors and pencil properly and now she could write both English and Chinese words beautifully (when she puts her mind to it!). One of her biggest improvement is in the Chinese language. She has always been and still is an “English speaking” girl and not a big fan of Chinese. At one point, her grandparents were concerned that she does not seem to understand Chinese, but now, she can reply in simple Mandarin. We were all impressed that she could recite “诗词” and sing some Chinese songs. Her Chinese writing also improved a lot and when I see her master the Chinese spelling every week now, I am really grateful to all her teachers. We can see her improve bit by bit and I am sure this is due to the foundation laid over the years. Her sister is in N1 now, and has already spent about 2 years in the school. Her development is also amazing. In the early days, she would cry every day when we send her to school but now she loves all her teachers and friends. She even tell me she has ""babies"" in school (i.e. newbies in her class) and she is a ""big girl"" now. Initially she is also reluctant to speak Mandarin but now I hear she can converse well in Mandarin. She has also grown more independent now and really loves performing. Both of them have very positive experience and development in the school and we never regretted our decision to enrol them in MindChamps Chinese Preschool @ Tampines Central. Although there were several changes of teachers through the years, they always love their teachers.

"Since enrolling in Mindchamp Chinese Kindergarten in July 2020, I have received a good education in both Chinese and English. We are very grateful to Teacher Liu, Teacher Huang, Teacher Ping, Teacher Darlene and Teacher Jaymee for their careful teaching, which has enabled the children to make great progress in many aspects. We have found that teachers are effective in motivating children to learn. For example, she often takes out a pen and paper after coming home from school and practices writing the letters and numbers she learned in school. It can be seen that she is very interested in what the teachers have taught her. I am very grateful to the teachers for taking the time to regularly organize and send the content they have learned to parents, so that we can consolidate and strengthen the knowledge we have learned at home in a timely manner. In addition, teachers are also very interactive with children during the teaching process. For example, when learning about insects, children are very interested in the transformation process of caterpillars, and their related Chinese and English vocabulary has also increased a lot. We also started trying to feed the caterpillars at home. The first thing we did after returning home every day was to visit and observe them. We were very interested. Our parents and children learned and gained a lot of knowledge about feeding caterpillars together in this process. At the same time, I am very grateful to the teachers for their patience and timely guidance. During the past year or so of learning at Mindchamp, we have seen significant progress in our children. Under the guidance of teachers, children have developed a strong interest not only in Chinese and English, but also in nature and science. At the same time, her personality gradually became lively and cheerful, she made many good friends in the class, and she also enjoyed sharing the handicrafts she made at home with her teachers.

"""I am writing to lodge an official complaint against M.Y WORLD @ Canberra Eastlink for negligence and unacceptable behaviour from the Playgroup teachers as well as Principal. My granddaughter was enrolled into the Centre for PlayGroup on 1 February 2024 & she is on a 2-week trial period. As she was transferred from a former childcare centre where she had spent more than 13 months, we understood there is a period of adjusting & transition. Unfortunately we feel that the teachers’ support for transition at M.Y WORLD was far below parental expectations, to a certain extent, lack of empathy. During week of 5 Feb, which happened to be the 1st week after orientation, we encountered a few unsatisfactory incidents. (1) the Centre called to say that my grandchild was crying uncontrollably & she was disturbing the rest of children during nap time, the Centre requires the caregiver or parent to bring the child home. My question : should the teacher(s) not try to pacify the crying child while she is still adjusting to the transition? What happens if the toddlers of the entire Playgroup class cried - does it mean the Playgroup has to stop operations & send all the crying toddlers home? (2) on 6 Feb, when my grandchild returned from school, our helper noticed bad rashes from the child’s belly to pubic area. We tried to contact the teachers to enquire however generic responses were provided, trying to shy away from responsibility. There was no evident efforts to investigate into what happened at all. (3) on 8 Feb, we received a notice from the centre that there was a bruise on the child’s face. There was no bruises on the evening of 7 Feb till the time when our helper sent the child to the Centre on 8 Feb morning. From the photo provided, it was suspected that the child could have hit a fixture. (4) in one of the telecommunications with the Principal - Ms Puva, she shouted over the telephone to my daughter (parent of my granddaughter) - ""your husband wants to write in to ecda? SURE! by all means go ahead! if your child is not suitable for this centre you can always feel free to source elsewhere"". She also informed email responses take 3 working days (despite there are 2 admin staff and 2 Vice Principals) because she is not at her desk every minute. M.Y WORLD at Canberra Eastlink was referred to us with positive feedback; unfortunately the reality turned out to be a horrifying experience for our family and my granddaughter. She used to be a happy kid going to school but she became an unhappy child when she arrived at the gate of the centre. I am extremely disappointed with the experience & service quality of the teachers, including the Principal. I have no confidence that M.Y WORLD could deliver its mission in the childcare & education industry. The negligence is unacceptable and intolerable. It was a nightmare enrolling my granddaughter into M.Y WORLD. We have since withdrawn my granddaughter from the centre, as advised by the Principal during her tele-conversation with my daughter, to prevent any further hurt and victimization.""",-0.12550660546350198,Topic 1,"['school', 'child', 'time', 'teacher', 'centre', 'day', 'parent', 'son', 'month', 'kid', 'bad', 'baby', 'principal', 'cry', 'send', 'like', 'know', 'money', 'enrol', 'feel']",M.Y World @ Canberra Eastlink

"""Personally, the litmus test on whether young kids should attend a school is whether they love or hate attending school. I have a 3 year old who started at this school since Nov 2021, and recently a 18 month old who started in Jun 2023. So far they have very happy demeanor every morning when I send them to school. The interaction between my kids and the teachers & non-teaching staff at school is also very positive. Earlier when I assessed the school environment, I like that because it is contained within Queenstown Lutheran Church, there is normally less strangers passing by on weekdays. Each class also has its own physical classroom - which was important for me esp it was during COVID times when I registered my 1st child. There's a small garden, swing, playground, scooter and tricycles all within the church premises that the kids can use. They also take the opportunity to teach the kids about nature and care for the plants in the garden. Course content also has a lot of creative learning. Every term the kids have 1 field trip to learn about the real world outside school. For all key festivals and holidays the kids are educated about the significance of the event and encouraged to create an art n craft piece to take home. The real bonus for us is that my elder kid has finally learnt to eat vegetables through the daily encouragement at school.

As 3 months passed with the morning hardship of taking her to school,I realised that she turned timid and never ate in school. After much consideration, I relocated her to LSS with faith that a catholic preschool will help. Within 2 months...I realised significant positive change - N2 under the leadership of teacher Karen. Her PAST traumatic experience took a year to recover and with the love and care from Teacher Dcruz, Zhang Liaoshu and He Liaoshu...she slowly regained her bubbly nature and I am so thankful.",0.1377840909090909,Topic 5,"['teacher', 'school', 'child', 'kid', 'care', 'good', 'love', 'thank', 'parent', 'principal', 'staff', 'learn', 'son', 'daughter', 'year', 'environment', 'great', 'preschool', 'ms', 'experience']",Little ShepherdsÃÂ Schoolhouse@Church of St Francis of Assisi-JW
"We are very glad that our child can study in Little Shepherds' Schoolhouse Church of St Francis of Assisi, a loving family. The LSS open outdoor activity setting has not only but not limit to trees, grasses, flowers, sand pool, soil slope and swings, which allow children to learn and play happily in a green environment close to nature. The vegetable garden in the backyard gives children the opportunity to experience the fun of planting and watering vegetables. Meanwhile, children enjoy the joy of harvesting in the process of caring for plants themselves, and naturally learn the value of life, thereby respecting life. The open classroom is arranged with various learning corners - reading, painting, music, handicrafts, experiments, and learning aids are put in an orderly manner. Children’s handicrafts created with environmentally friendly materials are displayed in the classroom from time to time, which cultivate children's awareness and ability to discover, observe and appreciate beautiful things imperceptibly. We sincerely thank the teachers of LSS for their efforts to organise various thematic activities periodically. Different thematic activities inspire children to understand the diversity of culture, different human customs, and create artworks full of creativity and imagination. Various thematic activities are also a bridge connecting schools, parents and communities, making the connection between parents and children, parents and teachers closer. Therefore, every parent has witnessed the growth of their children in LSS and the development and growth of LSS. Finally, we would like to thank our child's teacher, Mrs. Dcruz and He Lao Shi. The two teachers not only guide for children to learn book knowledge, but also practitioners who love life and nature. Mrs. Dcruz led the children to observe the mother of birds nesting under the eaves outside the classroom to apply eggs. He Lao Shi brought the baby chicken from home every Monday to let the children observe the growth of the baby chicken. In this process, children experienced the joy of vigourous growth of life and the sadness of losing vitality. We think this is a very meaningful life education. Last but not least, thanks to the leaders and teachers of LSS for their hard work.""",0.16610360360360363,Topic 5,"['teacher', 'school', 'child', 'kid', 'care', 'good', 'love', 'thank', 'parent', 'principal', 'staff', 'learn', 'son', 'daughter', 'year', 'environment', 'great', 'preschool', 'ms', 'experience']",Little ShepherdsÃÂ Schoolhouse@Church of St Francis of Assisi-JW

"I sent my two children to Little Seeds Preschool soon after both turned 20 months old. I was skeptical in the beginning because I was reading and hearing many bad incidents happened in preschools all around Singapore. After few months in the school, I am so glad that I’ve made the right choice. My kids are now in N1 and K1, I am assessing the school and my children in multiple areas. In term of the school, Teachers are very caring, loving, patience, communicating well with parents and showing empathy to the children. There were few minor incidents happened to my kids and they called me immediately to informed and clarified the issues with me. Principle and Admin Executives are very responsive and react fast to parent’s requests/enquiries. Thumbs up to the lovely Aunties who are preparing foods for the children, they are so in love with the children until my kids demanded me to buy presents to them in all occasions. Can you imagine what environment that the children are living in? On the other hands, some of the things need to be improved like the hygiene of the floor and environmental care like mosquitoes/insect’s issue bite. Both of my kids used to have mosquito’s bites but soon after I addressed the issue, the school responded fast and able to provide better environment for the children. Well done! In term of the school curriculum, the school adopted learn through play, outdoor learning and exploration, key to learning, project-based learning, visual arts, current affairs, art & craft, story time and many more. These make it so fun for the children and two of my kids love going to school. My kids are not just learning how to read and write in the school like most preschools are emphasizing. I don’t have to send them to enrichment classes and hence I spend more time with them on weekend. Due to Covid-19, outdoor activities are being suspended and kids are feeling sad. Besides that, I love the idea of celebration of events like CNY, Hari Raya, Deepavali, National Day, Teachers Day, Children Day, Harmony Day, Mid- Autumn festival and school projects like our dreams for Singapore. Fantastic! In term of my children, they both are doing well so far. We are the parents of emphasizing in characters building at these ages. They both have good EQ and showing good moral values like loving, respecting the senior, kind, showing empathy, communicating well with people, have good cognitive abilities. But my older one need more affords in anger management. Both showing good social responsibilities like they will complain to me that people shouldn’t throw rubbish on the floor and must keep our Singapore clean! Or cannot speak too loud in public places and many fun things happen every day. They both love going to school and my older boy can read well and write in English. My younger one loves sharing fun things in the school and kept mentioning Aunties CP and Aunties TY teach me this and that.

"""It has been about 3.5 years since we started journeying with the teachers at Little Seeds Preschool (LSP) Capstone on the care and growth for 2 of our children (7 and 5 years old). The older child has graduated to Primary school but still has many fond memories of his time back at Little Seeds. His time at LSP Capstone provided a good foundation and smooth transition to Primary School. Currently, our younger child looks forward to school everyday! She loves Praise and Worship, pastoral time, outdoors and music lessons. She also enjoyed the Project Work process where the teachers and children embarked on many STEAM activities to learn about the topic of Water and went on an excursion to the NEWater Visitor Centre! I really appreciate that my children are in good hands each day with teachers who love and care for them deeply and they effectively communicate through regular updates. From my conversations with my children, I understand that teaching does not happen only through a one-way instruction but through play and facilitated discussions to help the children question and discover truths for themselves. In terms of curriculum, I love the Key to Learning Syllabus and the way phonics is systematically taught. More importantly, values like gratitude, self-control, appreciation are taught and modeled in school. I see how my children are thriving in LSP Capstone and would definitely recommend this place!""",0.24320987654320986,Topic 5,"['teacher', 'school', 'child', 'kid', 'care', 'good', 'love', 'thank', 'parent', 'principal', 'staff', 'learn', 'son', 'daughter', 'year', 'environment', 'great', 'preschool', 'ms', 'experience']",Little Seeds Preschool (Capstone)

"Since Playgroup, my son, Mohamed Al-Fateh has been enrolled in the Little Green House School. I can still remember how he cried every day when he had to go to school because he didn't want to go and I'm having a hard time getting him settled into school. Despite this, the teachers at Little Green House School have been patient and putting in their best effort to help my son adjust to school. Now, he even chooses his favourite teachers in school, which are Teacher Siti and Teacher Merry. The teachers are truly invested in my son's education and growth as a learner. I was worried when my son couldn't speak in words or sentences, but I'm surprised that he started to say a few words and even speak in sentences after coming back home from school. It is my belief that a great leader is necessary for the success of great teachers. Ms. Nanz has been extremely helpful in assisting me with the subsidiary application. Her face is always filled with happiness and she greets her parents with a big smile on her face.

"""Little Green House @ Yishun has been an incredible place for our family, and we couldn't be more grateful for the exceptional care our child, Giselle Loh, has received. As we bid farewell to this wonderful child care center, we want to extend our heartfelt appreciation to two remarkable individuals who have made a lasting impact on our child's development and well-being: Teacher Yang and Teacher Siti, particularly in Giselle's Chinese class. From the moment Giselle stepped into the doors of Little Green House @ Yishun at just one and a half years old, we knew we had made the right choice for her early childhood education. The warm and nurturing atmosphere at the center, coupled with the dedication and expertise of the staff, has made it a second home for our little one. Teacher Yang's commitment to Giselle's Chinese language development has been truly exceptional. She possesses the rare gift of making learning both fun and educational, inspiring a genuine love for the language in our child. Under Teacher Yang's guidance, Giselle has blossomed into a confident and expressive little communicator. We are incredibly grateful for the patience and encouragement Teacher Yang has shown Giselle over the years, nurturing her love for the Chinese language. Teacher Siti, on the other hand, has been a constant source of comfort and support for Giselle throughout her journey at Little Green House. Her caring and compassionate approach has ensured that Giselle always felt safe and cherished, allowing her to develop not only academically but also emotionally. Her kindness and dedication have provided Giselle with a solid foundation upon which to build her future learning experiences. It is with heavy hearts that we say goodbye to Little Green House @ Yishun, but we do so with the knowledge that Giselle is well-prepared for her next educational adventure. The exceptional care provided by the center, and especially by Teacher Yong and Teacher Siti, has been instrumental in Giselle's growth and development during her time here. We will always hold a special place in our hearts for Little Green House @ Yishun and these incredible teachers who have played such a vital role in Giselle's early years. Thank you for your dedication, love, and support, and for making Giselle's time here truly unforgettable.

I am happy with the teachers' efforts towards the students' welfare. My little one joined last year. She's not looking forward to school on the first day as short experience somewhere else didn't give her much confidence. Teacher Semy brought her to mingle with older girls and allowed her to sit next to a classmate who's very keen to befriend her. The teachers play with her. Teacher Song and Teacher Siti are her friends. My child has since found a home away from home at the Little Greenhouse - she has made many friends and enjoys the programmes. We can see her growth through the Smart Literacy programme and enrichment lessons offered here. We appreciate that Teacher Yang's dedication to teach Chinese and make the school a fun place to be.

"Dear Teachers, Posting on behalf of my wife - Since the twins first started out in LGH way back in 2018 till to-date (they will be graduating from LGH this year), it has been a wonderful journey for them filled with constant learning, guidance, discipline from the great teachers in the centre. Each of the teachers are dedicated to the students, not forgetting the warm and love tendered to the kids and myself especially appreciate the constant feedback shared between the parents and teachers so that we are always aware on the kids learning and behavior and together both parents and teachers will surveillance to tackle any issues. For the past 5 years the kids has made many wonderful friends, it’s such a sweet feeling as we literally watch these kids grow. Also, great friendship were forged with the teachers - a special shout out to Tr D, MuMu Laoshi for their dedication to the K2 class especially to Tr D. Not only on curriculum, she take times and effort to cultivate kids interest on other activities eg art and craft. My kids like pokemon, sometimes during free time she will draw with them. There was once my son brought back a pikachu drawing and it was drew by her. We did not know there is this artistic side of her! haha. And personally on top of being a form teacher, I feel her warm yet strict calibre makes her an excellent discipline mistress too! The kids loves her to bits. Also kudos to MuMu Laoshi for holding the fort when there was a shortage on Chinese teachers, she tried her best to multi task and responded to our requests to her best ability. Ending off we would like to take this chance to say BIG thank you to all staff of LGH @ Tampines, Tr D, MuMu Laoshi, Tr Beth, Tr Jem, Ms Melissa and the past teachers like Tr Winnie, Tr Christina, Tr Fatin, Tr Salha, Tr May, Song Laoshi, Tr Suki, Zhang Laoshi, Miao Laoshi, Wang Laoshi, Auntie May.

Not as good as one would imagine them to be . The teachers are very rigid and not patient with children of different learning capacity's. I enrolled my child here looking at the good school reviews too but reality wasn't as hunky dory. Teachers are not contractable when you need them to be. Everything has to go thru the principal only. The principal made a huge hue and cry while trying to toilet train my daughter and within 6 months advise to put in 'special care'.

"""All my 3 kids went to/ currently in Little Footprints 168D Punggol. When my firstborn started in year end of 2015 in PG, it was honestly just another childcare to us. It was only in 2016 when the new principal came on board that we saw what a difference the leader makes. With the now-ex principal, she took many initiatives, all for the well-being of not only the kids, but for the young parents like us as well. She constantly kept us updated of our kids' progress over whatsapp. Its truly a blessing to be able to receive pictures of the little ones periodically as they learn in school, many milestones which we, working parents, will miss due to us working. The reminders over WhatsApp on happenings in school, such as festive celebrations, fees deadlines etc were also welcoming as there are many of us who are really not as responsive on emails/ app platforms. The environment in school was a welcoming one, with a sense of belonging for children. I knew the teachers well - you can sense they genuinely love the children and this the children reciprocate it back in return. My wife and I gave raving reviews about this school whenever the topic of childcare came up. The principal and her team were invested in the well being and growth of the children, not only academically. There were so many excursions, parent-child bonding activities etc planned that we were a part of. And also allowed for parents to know each other, forming an informal parent support group ourselves. However, all this ended in July 2022 when the principal left, and there was such a high turnover of teachers. Half or more of my youngest child's class had left due to the instability of the centre. Communication with the school now becomes generic. Only via the official platform, where children's updates are now slow/ non existent. Previously, height/weight is periodically recorded. Now, the last update was half a year ago. I dropped off my kids and see now the school is no longer as inviting as before. There is hardly any artwork of kids decorating the school premises, no more birthday babies' of the month pictures greeting you at the entrance etc. The centre has now become jus another business, where everything is transactional and reactive. Complaints get replied to with generic responses. An educator is more than just a business. I hope the management can relook into your processes. You once had a great team, there is a big shoe to fill. At least be open to feedback from parents - not jus dealing blindly with the feedback from parents and refusing to acknowledge it. I am sure statistics don't lie, look at your student withdrawals turnover rate of staff, they should tell you alot.",0.08582611832611835,Topic 5,"['teacher', 'school', 'child', 'kid', 'care', 'good', 'love', 'thank', 'parent', 'principal', 'staff', 'learn', 'son', 'daughter', 'year', 'environment', 'great', 'preschool', 'ms', 'experience']",Little Footprints Preschool Pte Ltd (Punggol 168)

"Big thanks to Ms Urmila who assured Ayesha’s journey in little footprints was worthwhile and memorable. Being first time parents, i was not confident leaving her, but urmila made sure she feels comfortable in school. Sharing daily activities of her was another calming thing for us being parents. Ms Chu Yi was kind n caring towards ayesha, i still remember her initial days she puked on her pants. Deep apologies, but appreciate that she used to clean her , make her sit on her lap again and sing nursery rhymes with her to constantly engage her. Ms Buwana made sure ayesha ate well in school. Updated me daily about her eating improvements and sleeping pattern in school which surely made me feel more secure and confident with her being in school. Ms Daya gave the warmth and love of a mother. Ayesha cries whenevr i drop her to school, she made sure to give ayesha hug for atleast 5 mins to calm her down. Ayesha hugs her back so tight like she hugs me. She got magical hugs which really soothed ayesha.

"Heartfelt Thanks for Exceptional Care and Education by Little Footprints Preschool (Blk 248 Jurong East) Dear Ms Susan and HQ Little Footprints, I am writing to express my deepest gratitude to Principal, Ms Susan and her dedicated team of teachers & staff especially Ms Jude and Zhang 老师 at Little Footprints Preschool for the outstanding care and education provided to my daughter, En Qi. I am truly impressed by the thoughtful curriculum planning and the immense effort that goes into creating a nurturing environment for the children. It is evident that the passion for education and genuine care for each child's well-being are at the core of Little Footprints. I recalled in one of the instances which was the Mid Autumn Festival 2023, I was truly impressed with the immense effort and care displayed by Ms Susan and her team of teachers & staff to dress up as Chang Er and Hou Yi to perform for the kids. This will help them understand the festival origins and why we need to celebrate the festival which is very important. They have also planned games and songs for us as parents to interact with the kids. I recalled this occasion fondly because I remembered that day was the hottest day in the month which temperatures soar to 36/37 degrees celsius. Despite that, they did not show any unhappiness but instead putting on their sweetest smiles and effort to guide and celebrate with the students on the festivities despite wearing thick costumes and head gear. Apart from the above, my daughter, En Qi has not only thrived academically but has also developed valuable social and emotional skills under the guidance of your exceptional team. Your commitment to fostering a positive and stimulating learning environment has made a lasting impact on her, and we are grateful for the positive experiences she has gained. Please extend our appreciation to Principal, Ms Susan and her team of teachers & staff especially Ms Jude and Zhang 老师 whom have played a crucial role in her growth and development. Their dedication and enthusiasm do not go unnoticed, and we are fortunate to have such a remarkable team shaping the foundation of our child's early education. Once again, thank you to Ms Susan, her team of teachers and staff in Little Footprints Preschool (Blk 248 Jurong East) for your unwavering commitment to providing a high-quality education and a caring atmosphere. We feel fortunate to be part of the Little Footprints Preschool community.

"My elder daughter first started preschool at LFP in July 2020 (was called Bright Juniors back then). She managed to settle down in school within two weeks, which is not surprising given that her then-PG teachers had such a vibrant and outgoing personality! Also, I could see my girl’s transformation when she started verbalizing her thoughts just a few weeks into school! Before school, she only could say simple words. I was also impressed with the thoughtfulness of the school in several levels: 1. In helping the children transit from PG/PN class to Nursery, there was an intimate handover, and tailored plan to help the children adapt to a relatively more “academic” focused curriculum, with writing classes, potty training etc. 2. The teachers are also very meticulous in caring for the children, for example they shared tips with me on how to help my daughter overcome the fear of showering her hair when they noticed such an issue. Even the non-teaching staff has much love for the kids. The aunty (responsible for cooking the meals and cleaning) also showed concern on my girl’s eczema condition and expressed her heartache when she saw the wounds while bathing her. I really appreciate the love showered on my kids. 3. The teachers put in a lot of effort in decorating the school, and dressing themselves and the children up, during festive seasons or special celebrations. During the recent reading week, my daughter’s teacher dressed as tinker bell, Jasmine (from Aladdin), red riding hood, Snow White, etc (just to name a few) to engage the children. This made school so fun and enjoyable, and my daughter came home sharing how she wanted to be a princess too! 4. The vitamin C lessons taught my children to be a better person than they could be. My elder daughter was facing difficulties coping with the birth of her baby brother. The teachers helped to guide her in celebrating her new brother’s presence! Recently, the kids also displayed motivation in “being helpful” at home from these lessons. Hence, when it’s time for my younger son to start school this year, I immediately enrolled him to LFP! I couldn’t be more grateful to meet such a dedicated team of early childhood educators in my children’s learning journey. thank you teachers, and happy teachers day!",0.19598264389931055,Topic 5,"['teacher', 'school', 'child', 'kid', 'care', 'good', 'love', 'thank', 'parent', 'principal', 'staff', 'learn', 'son', 'daughter', 'year', 'environment', 'great', 'preschool', 'ms', 'experience']",Little Footprints Preschool Pte Ltd (Jurong East 248)

"Mdm Zahara (Principal) First please allow me to say ""Thank You"" to the Principal and her team of dedicated teachers of Little Footprints Preschool (Yishun 71A). At the time of registration my 2 little girls, Veronica Shalini (4 yrs old) and Nageshwary (3 yrs old) were very fearful of their surrounding and shy to look up at strangers. Mdm Zahara gave us the assurance that she and her teachers will work hard to help these kids grow up with confidence and be knowledgeable.  She is always with a smiling face and shows that she is willing to listen to our concerns and give a helping hand. Now the 2 kids are in the 3 rd Term, and I can see improvement in their confidence level. This is itself a great achievement to the school and the teachers. PLEASE KEEP UP THE GOOD WORK Weili Luo (Teacher) She is a Chinese Language Teacher and trying her level best to teach my 2 Kids the language. I feel that she has somehow succeeded in her effort because sometimes the kids prompt a few words in the language. I think she is doing a great job and I must thank her foe her effort. The 2 kids have earned her trust and the school environment and are always willing to go to school. Normah Junid (Teacher) Veronica Shalini was having speech problem and her words are not clear. She is also the shy type. With Mdm Normah's willingness to teach and her positive approach has helped this child to come out from the shell. She can now speak in sentences and her Gross Motor Skills and Fine Motor Skills has improved quite a bit. The 2 kids have earned her trust and the school environment and are always willing to go to school.

"I would like to Thank the principal Ms Zahara. She was patient with my request and prompt to reply after we were put on waiting list. She has also been very supportive and always willing to lend a listening hear. Another Must Thank Teacher is Ms Karren. My daughter, Leora K2 has not been an easy to handle child when she started Little Footprints 2017, she was very uncooperative and timid during the first few months. In fact she suffered serious separation anxiety issues. Ms Karren was always calm and assuring with her, giving her the extra attention she needed. After less than three months, she won the trust of my girl and she was slowly able to enjoy coming to school. As Leora has learning difficulties and AHD, it is an uphill task to make her sit and listen and learn. Ms Karren was able to achieve the above while being assertive and assuring with Leora. Leora has also grown to be more out-spoken and importantly confident after two years....all these possible only with love and care displayed by Ms Zahara, Ms Karren and also her K2 Chinese teacher Luo LaoShi.

She definitely gives me a lot of confident even before sending my child to the centre. Ever since my child started PG with the centre, she has improved a lot in many aspects, like she's more interactive, she follows teachers' instructions (placing her shoes on the rack etc), she learns to sing songs and she's able to hold the spoon and eat her lunch independently. I'm very thankful to have found a centre with a team of wonderful teachers, especially He Laoshi who has shown passion and patience in caring for the children.

"I have enrolled my daughter to start the school in January next year and had to withdraw her with 1 month notice given due to personal reason. The Principal, Ms Jenny, demanded that I have to let go both registration fee and 50% of the school fee which was not what she said on the phone when we communicated. She only mentioned about the registration fee being forfeited. No form or details were emailed to me but only the details of the UEN number and subsidies form to get the procedures going. She was not only unhelpful but rude at the same time. Prior to me enrolling into the school, I went down for a school tour which she said she will be the one doing but I was given a tour by a teacher who is leaving the school hence no information about enrolment was given as well. I find it ridiculous that I have to pay 50% of the school fee when my child haven't even started school and I gave 1 and a half month notice before withdrawing my enrolment.

"My kid has been with Cherie Hearts @ Science Park for over 3 years now, teachers are friendly, nice and patient, turn over rate is pretty low, maybe there has been 3 new faces in the last 3 years, year end concert costumes and outings are at the reasonable cost. Teachers provide timely feed back about the kid, and they are open to have conversations with you at pick up time, they don't seems to be rushing you out at all. Overall the school makes me feel very relaxed and cozy like a family, kids all know each other from different classes, they chat, laugh and play together, you see happy kids not robots when picking them up.

"It was by leap of faith that my girl was enrolled in Little Footprints (Jurong West 660 branch). We were searching around our vicinity for a childcare centre when I (Mummy) came across this cute-looking uniform that LFP has. I contacted Ms Ang (The principal) and arranged for a visit to the centre and the rest is history. My girl started her Pre-nursery life with the centre from year 2021, when she was 2.5 years old. The principal and teachers took great effort and patience to help her adapt to school, keeping us updated constantly for the 1st few weeks as she settled down. Within the year, we saw how Roanne grew to be more independent (able to take charge of herself e.g. getting dressed, potty-trained) and gained a lot more knowledge. As my girl progressed to Nursery in 2022, we'd see her develop so much more, be it emotionally as she connects better with her classmates (having best friends!) and intellectually (the knowledge just keeps growing!). I specially like the ""Tick tock, Time to talk"" sessions the centre introduced. It helps to build confidence in the children when they speak in front of an audience, which will prove useful as they progressed further in life. One of the many aspects I like about centre is how engaging/attentive the principal and teachers are. We, parents are kept updated with the ongoings in school and our queries are always answered.

"""My child has been attending this pre-school since she was an infant, and I've witnessed the school's various phases of transformation over the years. It's newly renovated and so is the complex in which it's situated. Facilities are clean, new, and updated. The overall quality of this franchise has improved tremendously since it was bought over by a new operator some years back. What I appreciate: - The school is communicative. The bulk of communication and developmental updates are done through a well-functioning app, which I find more than adequate. They also provide regular developmental and curriculum updates. Inevitable viral outbreaks are well-controlled and well-communicated. Class promotions are well-executed. - The teachers are caring, patient, and chill. I've observed how well the new students adapt; many start initially shy and nervous but develop into confident, happy children. - The school takes a collaborative approach to nurturing the children. We shouldn't be outsourcing our parenting, and I appreciate how this school embraces that. If you're an involved parent and are willing to put in the work, you will find plenty of opportunities to be part of your child's growth. My child is always so happy when I get invited to her school for parties and story-telling. It's worth taking time off work for these occasions. - The curriculum is rich and well-rounded. I have no qualms that my child will be well prepared for the academic rigour of primary school. Heck, she's learning Chinese words that even I can't recognise! She's a confident public speaker due to the myriad of speaking platforms provided by the school. I also like how her Nursery class weaves in current affairs topics, which is awesome in developing societal awareness. - Meals are healthy and nutritious. My child sings praises of Aunty's cooking. She eats stuff that she normally wouldn't eat at home, like brown rice, soft tofu, and seaweed. Oh, the wonders of peer pressure! - The class composition is diverse and inclusive. I love how my child's class is made up of children of different socio-economic and family backgrounds, and with different developmental needs. As a result of her interactions within such a diverse class, my child is growing to be such an adaptable, kind, and empathetic individual. - The kids have scheduled outdoor play time, which is great. A little sun and dirt never hurt any kiddo. I'd appreciate a whole lot more outdoor play time. Room for improvement: - High turnover: My child has witnessed regular teacher resignations throughout her time here. Not sure if it's due to the competitive external environment or lacklustre talent retention strategies within the group. It's a real pity, because most of her teachers are so capable and competent.

"My kids were enrolled between 2 to 3 years here and I was glad to have pulled them out of this incompetent school. The management is always on the defensive side, teachers lack competence in dealing with young children and are quick to put labels on any child that is slower in learning etc. They lack training and the necessary soft skills and posture to handle young children. There were incidents of unacceptable practices as described by my child which were serious enough for us to make a report to ECDA. Shifted my older child to MOE Kindergarten and it has been the best decision we have ever made. My child has undergone a positive transformation away from the negativity of this preschool. Our only regret was not pulling him out sooner. This LFP school was a complete letdown and there is no CCTV installed to verify any of the alleged incidents - which leads me to believe that the staff were probably emboldened by this. The management had also said for more than a year that they were stabilising WIFI infrastructure as an excuse to not install CCTV. I do not trust this school nor the management and would not recommend such a school to any parent. You need to have just one conversation with the principal of this school and this will shed light on the attitude of the management. Cluster manager Lily is also more intent on ensuring that her teachers don't leave the school (manpower issues I guess) than on really wanting to resolve these issues and set acceptable standards.",0.16161616161616163,Topic 5,"['teacher', 'school', 'child', 'kid', 'care', 'good', 'love', 'thank', 'parent', 'principal', 'staff', 'learn', 'son', 'daughter', 'year', 'environment', 'great', 'preschool', 'ms', 'experience']",Little Footprints Preschool (Ang Mo Kio)

We are very grateful for the excellent education our daughter received in learning vision school. Ana has made very good progress in both English and Chinese languages as well as other aspects of education. When she started her primary 1 education in January this year in International School she adjusted easily to the curriculum and received very good feedback from teachers for her level of education and knowledge in English and Chinese language. Her current Chinese language teacher assessed her knowledge of Chinese language above average and on top in class. We are very happy that this transition period has become easier for Anastasiia due to her education in Learning Vision. She attended additional Chinese language classes in Learning vision as well as additional once weekly lessons in Chengzhu school in the last few years. All this contributed significantly to her confidence and improvements in Chinese language learning.

The environment is clean, aircon not too cold for the kids and the teachers are a very dedicated bunch and they absolutely love the kids. Their pedagogy focuses on developing all rounded children, reading, and lots of hands on activities like preparing their own lunches, little reporters, learning from kids from other parts of the world etc. and they even have a dedicated PE teacher for the kids for exercise time.

"""Previously sent my infant daughter in as I've heard alot of great things about this ctr. Long wait list and extremely popular among parents = good right? I'm sorely disappointed. We were on the wait list before I gave birth and she went in when she's around 6 mth old. The ctr is running at full capacity and at times I'm not sure if the teachers are able to cope or stretching at their max. First - My daughter 's bum constantly red from rash - most likely from delayed diaper change and no, she don't have delicates sensitive skin. Second - she's constantly having runs and I could see intact corns and brown rice in her waste. Ctr continued to feed her such items even after I expressed concern over the suitability as she's only 8 mth old. Even a fellow mummy said the same thing about her infant son, who's also at the Centre. During pick up, at times we will glance at her through the viewing glass. She will be sitting down and stoning. No evening activities or toys to engage her. Alot more issues which I will not go into details. We pulled her out of the Centre as their in charge are not keen to further engage us, but I would like to give thank to their admin support staff ms Joyce - she's super nice and helpful.

"My daughter have been in KMY for 3 yrs and she enjoy her time there. From a shy girl, she is now more confident. KMY's other activities such as nature magnified is great as it opens up their mind about our great mother nature. KMY also organised field trips to places of interest, so classroom learning is not just textbook based. They gave timely updates on my daughter's progress, be it formally through report card or photos of their activities. KMY also organised recycling activities, which bodes well with current environmental needs.

They don't straight away judge your child, they will find root cause and then get it treated from there. She have graduated and in primary 2 now. I have another son who's been with the school since he was 18 months and we all thought he was mute cause he was quiet all the time until he went kidz meadow and start singing nursery rhymes and talk alot. Time flies he's graduating soon. This year 2023 i enrol my 18 months son with medical history diagnosed. 2 school rejected him because they don't want to take risks and if I insisted to send my son to their school I must be with him at all times which I felt defeated the purpose of sending him to school. They also suggest me to send my son to special school at Awwa which I don't want because I want my son to feel that he's normal.

"My child has been in the centre since April 2023, and I’m here to leave Kidz Meadow Jurong West a well deserved 5 stars rating review and I’ll share why. The centre has left a huge positive on child & family as a whole. They most definitely deserve the five stars. According to these 5 aspects: 1.	Communication - My first communication was with the admin through a phone call, Ms Diana which is I felt that she was very knowledgeable in providing all sorts of information that I need or might need. She assisted in registering my child and the process was smooth sailing. Mdm Liyana, the principal was very warmth and welcoming during the school tour, assuring us first timer parents. She provided the necessary details through and through via their termly circular, monthly update every now and then updates which helps us working parents to stay on track. Channels such as phone call, emails and parent’s communication app were all active to stay communicated within one another. 2.	Environment – The environment set up for the children are well planned out and engaging for children to stay attracted and interested. They keep up the standard of cleanliness and step up with necessary protocol in times of an outbreak which assured us parents that our child’s safety is not compromised at any point. 3.	Child’s progress & development – Although my child has only been in the centre for 5 months and counting, I am happy that my child is progressing and hitting more milestones as an individual and socially. I am sold when I learnt that centre provides Malay language as a second language which is one of the top criteria when I planned to send my child. My child’s progress and development is always updated and areas to improve are always shared by the teachers so I know how else I can continue to support my child. 4.	Meaningful events – KMJW always organised and planned meaningful events that involves the community, parents, staffs and children which I feel is really a wholesome experience to allow my child to be nurtured as an all rounded person. Events that we had seen and participated such as Hari Raya Celebration, CareerDay & Field Trip Excursion, Mother’s Day Celebration, Termly Disposition Day, Father’s Day Celebration, Fundraising Bazaar for Partidor, Parent-Child Workshop, Racial Harmony Day Celebration, National Day Celebration etc. I am very awe by the constant events & parental-involvement activities created on top of their daily routines and normal curriculum activities. 5.	Passionate & loving staffs – I can never say enough thank you to all the KMJW staffs, especially my child’s current form teacher – Teacher Hairah and alongside, Teacher Dilah, Teacher Seri & Teacher Tse Er who had been there for my child since her first day of school. The safety net and assurance that the teachers had built with my child had helped the transition of dropping off and picking up less stressful because the staffs really take note of what my child likes and dislikes. This goes to show the staffs in KMJW really take pride in their job to ensure bonds and rapport are build. I am thankful that KMJW has always kept a standard that is beyond my expectation and in no doubt, if I ever have another child, I’ll place them here <3",0.19696969696969696,Topic 5,"['teacher', 'school', 'child', 'kid', 'care', 'good', 'love', 'thank', 'parent', 'principal', 'staff', 'learn', 'son', 'daughter', 'year', 'environment', 'great', 'preschool', 'ms', 'experience']",Kidz Meadow Childcare & Development Centre (Jurong West)

"My son has been attending Kiddiwinkie for nearly two years. He absolutely loves the school and his teachers. He enjoys the outdoors, especially the ""big playground"" and the bicycle area. I also believe that spending time outdoors is very important for the little ones. The school is bright and inviting. Both teachers (from this and the last year were lovely and super caring). The only thing that my son sometimes complains about is the temperature in school. He finds it quite cold hence I always have to include a warm jumper for him. The food is healthy and the variety seems to be good (my son says that it's yummy). The quality of education is fantastic. The school teaches high level of mandarin and correct English (no singlish). I love that kids are being taught a variety of skills: how to plant, how to be independent, how to create toys from recycled goods etc. The school also has a nice water play area. The management was always attentive, professional and pleasant (even when they had to deal with my difficult requests or complains).

"After leaving Kiddiwinkie do I realise what a total mess this school is. Teachers are arrogant. Right from when you drop your child off at school. No genuine care and concern that should come from a pre-school. The outdoor premise is not clean. Full of dead mosquitoes when my husband lifted up a bucket in the garden. I had numerous talks with teachers on how to deal with my ‘active’ 3 year old. Isn’t that a norm at that age though? Not to mention the massive salmonella issue they had that caused an outbreak in the school. Horrible school. Don’t trust the good reviews, talk to the actual parents who are waiting for their children outside. You will know the truth. Examples of nasty remarks: - ‘come in no need to be scared, it’s the same routine every day’ *rolls eyes at kid*. - ‘oh you are late again’. At my child who was 3 years old, not me.. My son refused to step into school for months. He’s usually a bold child. And this behaviour is not only to my child, it’s to other children as well. Just stand around the front door for a few days in the morning and watch the interaction with the teachers and children. You will know yourself. It took a long time for me to consider writing a review. I even thought of writing a formal complaint to the Babilou group. I totally realise how wrong this school is in every way, after enroling my child in another school.

"Would like to give my compliments to teacher Grace and Liu laoshi of the Nursery class. They have been a great source of support for my daughter this year. My daughter looks forward to interactions with both teachers. She also specifically requests for teacher Grace in the mornings and speaks fondly of her. Both teachers have been especially responsive to questions and also supportive of my daughter'a journey as a sleep trained kid. They update me when she skips naps and is aware of her temperament when she is not well rested. Also, quick highlight on the principal, Ms Tricia as well. She has been there throughout my daughter's preschool journey for the last 3 years. Consistently understanding and its comforting to know that the teachers are headed by a compassionate leader. Very grateful for the support that I've been given by the good teachers of Kiddiewinkie. :) I will be sending my son this son when he turns 20 months and I strongly recommend this school.",0.3606060606060606,Topic 5,"['teacher', 'school', 'child', 'kid', 'care', 'good', 'love', 'thank', 'parent', 'principal', 'staff', 'learn', 'son', 'daughter', 'year', 'environment', 'great', 'preschool', 'ms', 'experience']",Kiddiwinkie Schoolhouse @ Grandstand Pte Ltd (Cactus)
"Sincerely grateful to Infant teachers and Principal Tricia for taking such good care of our little one. It was the best decision made, to enroll my little one to KW @ Cactus. Prompt updates was given on our little one daily and the portfolio update was done on a weekly basis via app to inform us on her journey with KW. My child loves school and we can see the difference in her growing up as a child who goes to KW. Principal Tricia is also very strict on hygiene and this gives us a peace of mind as that was our biggest concern before sending our child to infantcare. We know that our little one will be safe and happy in school under Principal Tricia and the wonderful loving/caring teachers.

"I happened to chance upon KW @ Cactus in search of a suitable childcare around my area last year. During the sch tour, I liked that the classrooms were spacious and clean and the school had its own outdoor play area. I was also keen on the KW’s curriculum and the low teacher to students ratio. The Principal Ms Tricia was very hands on. After enrolment, she and the teachers helped my girl to blend well into the new environment during the difficult times of separation anxiety, which I am really grateful. One year on, my girl has grown to like going to school and makes friends in the class. Many thanks to the teachers at KW @ Cactus especially to the PG teachers - Teacher Grace, 郭老师, Teacher Ivy for their care, guidance and patience, and also 刘老师 and 杨老师who had taught her. My girl loves Teacher Grace and likes to mimic her actions like teacher at home. There are weekly updates on kid’s progression and the communication is prompt.

"A big thank you to all teachers and support team at Kiddiwinkie Cactus! My son has been attending school at this centre since December 2018 and the teachers especially Teacher Christlyn, Tian Laoshi and Teacher Ivy from his PG class, as well as Principal Evonne and Teacher Zoe were extremely patient and caring to get him assimilated to the school environment. I truly enjoyed my first 3 days of orientation with him although he was crying very badly due to the new environment and separation anxiety. Teacher Christlyn was very patient and experienced to try to get my son to nap in school on day 1 as I decided to start him on a full-day class right from the start. Over the initial days and weeks of the school, we get very regular updates from Teacher Christlyn, his form Teacher on how my son is adapting in school. Teacher Ivy and Tian Laoshi were also extremely patient in coaxing him whenever he cries or throws a tantrum. School must have been amazing for my son as he stopped crying at morning drop-off 2 weeks after he started school which came as a big surprise to us. It just happened one fine day! As parents, we are very elated to see our son enjoying his school so much. On 2 occasions when he had to miss school due to him being unwell and another for being suspected of HFMD, he seems restless and easily irritated at home (besides his possible discomfort). Nonetheless, we saw a sharp turn of his emotions on the night after he first returned back to school. On a regular basis, we receive photo and video updates on his school activities which never fails to warm our heart, especially during a hard day at work. Thank you! As a close-knitted team in school, we frequently see Teachers from other levels helping out in his PG class and during assembly.

"Joyous Learning is a gem in the field of education. The reasons are as follows: 1. As a boutique enrichment centre, the communication between centre and parents is top notched (for example, special schedule changes and reminders are sent in a timely fashion and this helps busy parents a great deal in the management of their children's extracurricular lessons). 2. There is a lot of ""heart"" in the modus operandi of the centre. Firstly, they do not pre-select students. I understand some centres conduct proficiency and aptitude tests prior to enrolling the students to ensure strong good results statistics. By not running pre-selection, Joyous Learning is a true educator at heart as every child is given the opportunity to be inspired to ignite their love for learning and hone their mastery in the various subjects. 3. The teaching materials are thoughtfully planned and designed to challenge the children and level up their proficiency in the respective subjects. 5. The teachers are dedicated and passionate about their craft. This is the game-changer that sets them apart. I will like to send a special shout-out to Mr. Marcus Goh. My child enjoys lessons tremendously at Joyous Learning under the fine tutelage of Mr. Goh. At the same time, he engages his students by creating a stress-less learning environment that encourages participation and the fun methodology applied creates a higher retention rate for the knowledge imparted. He has made a difference and made learning, for a lack of better word, joyful (and meaningful). 4. Value-added information is uploaded on their blog posts and newsletter on a very regular basis. This is a very altruistic act of sharing with keen learners who are unable to gain access to paid enrichment/tuition lessons. The side effect of being a student of Joyous Learning Centre is that regular school curriculum has become somewhat boring and unchallenging but that's a good issue to have, isn't it? ;-) In summary, I highly recommend Joyous Learning as an enrichment centre.",0.2269206349206349,Topic 5,"['teacher', 'school', 'child', 'kid', 'care', 'good', 'love', 'thank', 'parent', 'principal', 'staff', 'learn', 'son', 'daughter', 'year', 'environment', 'great', 'preschool', 'ms', 'experience']",Joyous Learning

To our surprise, YiYi adapted quickly within just over a week, largely thanks to the teachers’ attentive care, The genuine smiles from the teachers greeting the children each morning are heartwarming. Particularly, Ms. Katrina. About three weeks into school, YiYi naturally ran to Ms. Katrina, showing a strong bond they had formed.

"""Really need to share here. Greenland is an Awesome preschool!!! I shifted to Punggol since 2018 and there's only 3 preschool here. I registered both EB and MW as they are the nearest, waited for 3yrs and i decided to go Greenland because finally they have slot. I am so glad i did not get into other preschool earlier even though that caused my kid starts late, at N2. I always think those popular/ expensive childcare will be best for kids but i am wrong. What I heard from mommies friend was they don't teach so much. Most of the time its really ""child care"" playing. But here in Greenland they TEACH. Focusing more on academics which is the most important, a good foundation before then move on to primary school. Not only mine, kids in Greenland are brave, independent, read well, caring, smiley, happy. They started spelling in K1, from 5 words to 10. Both English and Chinese. (My daughter just started her P1 now and she told me her spelling in what she had in K1... So easy) i have no worries on that. And she is able to count and pay for her meals in primary school. Which a huge relief for us as parents. We do not have to do much. Greenland do everything and get them well prepared for primary school life. During school holidays, they even have theme event for learning, field trip learning, phonics rocketeer holiday workshop etc. comparing to other childcare centre i heard (even from the teacher) they did not have such arrangements and said that's too troublesome. So i asked them what they usually do during holidays? They said just go school eat nap and play toys. I couldn't imagine that. Recently MK open for registration for my youngest one. But i do not wish her to leave and change a new environment. Because she is so happy with the friends and teachers there in Greenland. I'm glad my elder graduated from Greenland. She became cheerful, smart, caring, helpful. And during her graduation last year, Greenland Sumang walk combined with Punggol drive branch. I was surprised! Both the kids from Sumang walk and Punggol drive can do very well speech and best performance i ever seen. Really a big surprise to all parents. We watch them growing well under Greenland's care. Is the best choices I've made. So happy my youngest child still have another 3 joyful years learning in Greenland before she graduate. Everyday just so happy to see my kids go to the school with big smile. Sincerely appreciate their hard work. Principal, Teachers and admin in Greenland Childcare Sumang walk always sweet and caring.

"BE WARNED, PARENTS! Most of the reviewers here gave 5 stars to all their branches, go figure. Next, you can read my experience. During their open house, we were promised that our kid could start playgroup with them in November 2023. We believed them and enrolled with deposit. We waited for few weeks, during which even rejected school nearer to our place. Recently, we felt the need to confirm our admission because Greenland kept silence all this time, but was told November isn't possible, must wait for Jan next year because ""that open house was for Jan"". Their only solution for not being able to keep their words was for us to enrol into the new school first then transfer to Greenland in Jan (I applaud them!). Of course, according to their policy we can't get the deposit back, even if they tricked us in the first place. No apology whatsoever, as if this is really just our problem and our decision to make. It's dishonest and disgusting. Honestly, I don't feel OK to leave my kid with them any more.""",0.09994318181818182,Topic 5,"['teacher', 'school', 'child', 'kid', 'care', 'good', 'love', 'thank', 'parent', 'principal', 'staff', 'learn', 'son', 'daughter', 'year', 'environment', 'great', 'preschool', 'ms', 'experience']",Greenland Childcare @ Sumang Walk Pte Ltd
"""Greenland childcare is a premier childcare that provides pleasant learning experience for children and certainly a preschool that prepares the children well for primary school. The staff were nurturing, understanding and relatively accommodating to parent's request. My son recently graduated while my daughter is still attending class in Greenland. I am always amazed with Greenland's pedagogy as my children are able to recite and speak languages that I find it difficult to teach them. On the team of teachers, the childcare principal, Ms Puva and her team definitely stood out for developing nurturing approach for the children in Greenland childcare. Their passion for early childhood education was evident in the way each teachers interacted with each child, meeting their individual needs with patience and kindness. There are always different engaging activities planned for the children, from hands-on learning experiences to imaginative play sessions and outdoor learning journey as well. The learning environment at Greenland was nothing short of impressive. The classrooms were bright and inviting, filled with colorful educational materials and age-appropriate toys that sparked children's curiosity and creativity. The curriculum was well-rounded, encompassing a variety of activities that catered to children's social, emotional, cognitive, and physical development. What stood out to me the most was the sense of community and collaboration fostered within the childcare center. Children were encouraged to work together, share ideas, and respect one another's differences. The teachers also worked seamlessly as a team, ensuring that each child received personalized care and attention throughout the day. As a parent, I can confidently say that Greenland provides an exceptional learning environment for young children. The dedicated childcare principal and her team go above and beyond to create a nurturing and enriching space where children can learn, grow, and thrive. I would highly recommend this childcare center to any parent looking for high-quality care and education for their little ones.",0.21273088023088027,Topic 5,"['teacher', 'school', 'child', 'kid', 'care', 'good', 'love', 'thank', 'parent', 'principal', 'staff', 'learn', 'son', 'daughter', 'year', 'environment', 'great', 'preschool', 'ms', 'experience']",Greenland Childcare @ Fernvale Pte Ltd

"Both my boys studied and graduated from Greenland Fernvale and my younger one is this year 2023 K2 graduate. Indeed, he only joined the school in K1 while most of his classmates started since nursery/infant. I still rmb he was a crying clingy child when he first joined. But I am so blessed to have his K1 and K2 class teachers- Teacher Mae and Lei Laoshi. They always gave my boy big hugs, encouragement and even told him/ other kids in his class that can treat them as mummy/ daddy in school which let him felt more secured and loved. They literally treat their class students as their own kids. Other than comforted my boy, they also comforted me by kept me updated on his progress in school and gave me confidence that he was coping well in school. At the beginning, I was worried about his speaking and social skills, but few months later he just improved dramatically and in latest PTC, teachers even mentioned he sometimes talked too much to his friends..opps..haha. Throughout these 2 years, the school/ teachers arranged a lot of different activities both inside and outside school and he learned both academic and non academic knowledge which can really lessen my stress to prepare him to go to primary school. What I liked most is the school atmosphere so homely that made my boy felt secured and safe and so could express himself freely which I believed is the key factor for a kid to enjoy learning at this age with a peace of mind. I would like to take this opportunity to special thanks to all teachers/staffs who taught and took care my boys in this school. Highly appreciated your effort, love and care to my little ones.",0.20312049062049065,Topic 5,"['teacher', 'school', 'child', 'kid', 'care', 'good', 'love', 'thank', 'parent', 'principal', 'staff', 'learn', 'son', 'daughter', 'year', 'environment', 'great', 'preschool', 'ms', 'experience']",Greenland Childcare @ Fernvale Pte Ltd
"Teachers from Greenland childcare at Fernvale go above and beyond to create memorable experiences for my son, nurturing their minds and hearts with genuine care. I still remember the first day of my son joining the school, at his age of 3 who faced separation anxiety, it was normal phase also it wasn't easy, but with the help of our amazing teachers, he blossomed into a confident and excited child, eager to go to school every after the day. Once my son told me this- Teacher Mae mentioned to him: “If you miss your mommy and daddy, you wish to hug them, hug me. Teachers Mae and LeiLaoShi are you mommy and daddy in school.” This was truly assuring words to him, and I felt the teachers empathy the inner of every child. Since then, i knew my son would in good hands🪄 Beside, they organising and engaging events to involve parents in my son preschool journey, they leave no stone unturned in ensuring a holistic education for every child. Teachers are true superheroes, pouring their hearts into every lesson and activity. They creating a safe and supportive environment where they can thrive. 💚Because of these amazing educators, my son happily looks forward to going to school every day and returns home with a smile on his face, humming rhythmic and dancing steps he learnt at preschool. Today, my son is graduating from their center, specially thankful to year 2023 K2 teachers in-charge Teacher Mae and LeiLaoShi (Teacher Lei). Their dedication is truly inspiring! My som and children from the same class love them very very much. I am really fortunate i to have them.

"This sch deserves more than 5 stars! Both my kids, one is 6 and the other is 3 are enrolled in this centre. Trust the teachers here and place your kids with no worries! My girl started out as a timid, shy and emotional child who cried ovwe everything. But 4yrs down the road, she has blossomed into someone who speaks with confidence, friendly twds everyone and even manages her emotions well. She is able to read and write both english and chinese and this is No credit to myself because I'm a hands off mummy once I pick her up from sch. She will even share with me on what she and her teachers will chat about, and even requested to be the last to be picked up from the centre. Ask any of her classmates and I'm confident that they have their own testimonials of their child's breakthrus too! My son did have a change in teachers this year but he impressed me with how he is able to express his feelings by telling me when he is happy and when he is sad or angry. And he can come home singing songs he learnt from sch, showed me some dance steps he learnt and request to make cards for his teachers. Most of his classmatez started out as a baby in infant care and if the centre had issues, I'm sure they wldnt have continued with pg and now, PN. One of my concerns when selecting a cc back then was also hygiene. But greenland has one of the lowest hfmd and covid cases in this area. How would I know? Because my neighbours wld share updates from their sch and no immediate action was taken from the centre even when they had rising cases of hfmd. This centre has a very holistic curriculum that you don't see in some other schs. Outdoor programme includes gardening and exploring the types of insects you can find at the garden too. If you still have your doubts, just approach any parent who has their kids hanging around at the playground and I'm pretty sure they have ntg but gd reviews of the teachers and principal too!",0.2115277777777778,Topic 5,"['teacher', 'school', 'child', 'kid', 'care', 'good', 'love', 'thank', 'parent', 'principal', 'staff', 'learn', 'son', 'daughter', 'year', 'environment', 'great', 'preschool', 'ms', 'experience']",Greenland Childcare @ Fernvale Pte Ltd

"Parents should just keep an eye if your kids go to this childcare, and should always check with your kids if they everyday cry say dont want to go school. This is definitely a red flag! My daughter went to this childcare few months ago, and this is her first time attending childcare, so definitely would take time for her to adapt to the new environment, but the teacher in pre-nursery group especially teacher pamela is very impatient and not caring towards the kids, whenever she will cry she will bring her to the side and firmly hold her hands and beat her leg when she cannot stop crying. Although the teacher said she didn't do that, but i choose to trust what my daughter said as a 3 yr old kid won't lie, adults will lie. Because of this impatient and unprofessional teacher, my daughter was so traumatized everyday before go to school previously, and will cry whenever i say ""school"" this term at home. Luckily i managed to transfer her to another school and everything changed thereafter! The teachers in the new school are very caring and patient, my daughter only cry the first day and never cry again in the school.

"""Saying goodbye to the school was tough, mainly because of its inaccessible location, which can pose challenges during commuting for two working parents. But despite that, we can't thank the school enough for the incredible learning journey they provided our son over the past 9 months! Right from the start, the onboarding process was remarkably smooth, and he adapted to school life exceptionally well, showing genuine enthusiasm every day. Before school started, the principal reached out to us 3-4 weeks beforehand, providing helpful details about packing lists and uniforms. Throughout that crucial first week, both the principal and teachers kept us updated, offering invaluable reassurance to us as newbie parents and to our child. Here's what truly stood out for us: 1. Facilities: - A fun indoor playground right by the entrance - Spacious open areas with ample natural daylight 2. Accessible & Effective Communication: - The principal was always quick to respond to any questions or concerns, making us feel supported and confident. 3. Curriculum: - The curriculum encouraged independence, helping the children develop gross motor skills quickly and become competent in dressing themselves. 4. Teachers: - The high teacher ratio ensured each child received ample attention during class. - Despite some turnover, likely due to external factors, we're grateful to the dedicated teachers who remained, showing unwavering patience and dedication. We've seen remarkable growth in our son, especially in his communication skills. He now speaks more fluently and confidently, readily identifying colours and body parts. It's clear he thrives in this nurturing environment and has developed a genuine love for learning. Though it's sad to say goodbye to such a wonderful school, our priority remains our child's well-being and continued growth in a nurturing setting. We're deeply grateful that My First Steps was part of our child’s preschool journey! 😊",0.2331420431420431,Topic 5,"['teacher', 'school', 'child', 'kid', 'care', 'good', 'love', 'thank', 'parent', 'principal', 'staff', 'learn', 'son', 'daughter', 'year', 'environment', 'great', 'preschool', 'ms', 'experience']",First Steps Preschool @ MacPherson
"I had my son enrolled in this school since they started with just less than 10 students and that was 3-4 years ago. The teachers were very good, caring and nurturing back then. The number of students with ratio to the compound size is also good. However, in the past 1-2 years, all the good teachers have left suddenly within a few months apart. The students increased drastically and the place suddenly became so crowded. Eventually, we decided to withdraw my son out from the school even though he have established and made many friends. It is a hard decision but these are a few points that we have considered before withdrawing him 1. Poor updates from school (this only happens after the good teachers left) 2. Ever since the good teachers left, my son teachers keeps changing. I felt that this is not good for him as he have to keep adapting to the new teachers. 3. Not much activities being done, every day is just about tracing and practising writing which I think may be the easiest way for the school (just worksheets) but too much for the students. 4. Sometimes I waited 10 minutes just for someone to open the door to send my son into the school. Once I missed the smooth traffic hours, this could lead me to another 20-30 minutes for me to reach my office (often resulting in me being late for work, esp when I have meetings in the morning) However, I want to give praise to my son Chinese teacher. She is one of the better teacher who did not leave the school.

"My child has been attending this school since PG, and her learning has improved as of late compared to the past, this could only be attributed to the attention that the teachers are giving to her. Previously I realized that she did not really enjoyed going to school for classes and only had wanted to engage in play time. Ever since she had a change in teachers I began to notice that she shares more about what she does during lessons and that she actually enjoys school and classes. This is especially contrasting to what some of the other parents feel, but there is no perfect school nor perfect teachers. Instead of lambasting and lashing out, parents ought to be more appreciative of the teachers. They are there daily at 7am, even though most of them have their own children and family, though it is their job, they are humans as well and they have their own emotions and thoughts. In this day and age where it is easy for everyone to be critical and to be heard, everyone should take a pause and evaluate the situation in fairness first before critiquing.",0.16150793650793652,Topic 5,"['teacher', 'school', 'child', 'kid', 'care', 'good', 'love', 'thank', 'parent', 'principal', 'staff', 'learn', 'son', 'daughter', 'year', 'environment', 'great', 'preschool', 'ms', 'experience']",First Steps Preschool @ MacPherson
"Not sure why my review keeps getting removed from the page. Below review by another parent is 100% accurate. Initially, I thought we were the only affected class. But it seems across the entire school, there are problems such as poor management, lack of teachers and poor updates. Previously, school was fun and the kids looked forward to attending school. Things took a big turn once the good pioneer teachers left and the high turnover of teachers meant that the kids got to keep readjusting to new and random teachers - some eventually left too. Well, first hand witnessed how the school director/principal talked to the teachers and I can understand why some left. Seems like most teachers have to take multiple classes too due to lack of manpower and there are mainly Chinese teachers. Understand manpower crunch is a common issue in early childhood industry but this problem doesn’t seem to improve here. School updates frequency was so bad. Sometimes if you don't ask, you get nothing. Once a week not too much to ask for right? Somemore some parents were promised two updates a week when they joined. What a lie. Communication is poor as well. Most notable example, they boasted about a merger coming along, held a town hall and everything sounded exciting. Made parents go through revised administration processes and then out of nowhere said merger failed thereafter, way past the expected merger date. No accountability of how it would affect school and students. School director/principal is unfriendly and have mood swings. Not sure if she applies the same attitude to the kids in school, especially when she is also one of the teachers. When she’s in good mood, she may smile at you if she sees you. Most days, she is sulky and treats you as invisible. A bit strange as she is supposed to be the leader and face of the school. Some of the surviving teachers there are quite friendly. Just hope they are well taken care of. Location is also pretty convenient I guess. School is open concept so it can be very chaotic and noisy but also may be fun for kids as they get to know people across levels and move around the compound. Depends on your preference. @Don, perhaps it’s time you look into the operations of the school as it is currently not the standard it was when you first started this branch.",0.05630822510822511,Topic 5,"['teacher', 'school', 'child', 'kid', 'care', 'good', 'love', 'thank', 'parent', 'principal', 'staff', 'learn', 'son', 'daughter', 'year', 'environment', 'great', 'preschool', 'ms', 'experience']",First Steps Preschool @ MacPherson
"Contrary to what some reviewers reviewed First Steps MacPherson on Google Map, I feel that the school, be it the principal and teachers are trying their best to run the place well. I'm going to rate it 4 stars as with all systems, there's always room for improvement. Starting from the Principal, how the P manages her team of teachers is up to her personal style and to the characteristics of the directed teacher. I don't think it's fair to put all the blame of high attrition rate to the P's management style. As with many of us, we change jobs for better paying environment or due to unforseen circumstances. And why is it that the Chinese teachers aren't leaving compared to the other teachers? Due to instigation by fellow English teachers? Some say that the P has mood swings. Don't we all do? Like us, the P is also human. The P also has personal, family, financial, work issues that we all face daily. What's more a P that has to deal with about 100 students + staff daily. Give the P a break man! Additionally, manpower crunch is everywhere. The MOE system has relief teachers on standby whereas Preschools do not have relief teachers to standby whenever there's a shortfall. Teachers have higher tendency to fall ill in preschools too. And with annual leaves, study leave, maternity leave etc., it is inevitable that there are manpower shortages time to time. With technology improvements, parents can now request for updates from the teachers. Having updates can provide parents with info on how well their child is doing in school. But all these updates require the teacher to be offline and not tending to the child, meaning during their break or even off work hours. Their job is not easy. And the teachers deserve their short break before kids awake from their nap. Worse case scenario is that the teacher can't rest as there are kids that need coaxing or not wanting to nap. To parents who think that this job is easy, recall how your child's birthday celebration in school was like. You would have a taste of what they really deal with in that short 1 hour of celebration. Some of us need a helper because we can't manage our own kids, can you imagine what's it like to manage 10 over kids with just 2 teachers (sometimes 1). The merger of the school has nothing to do with the P and the staff. Keep them out of upper management problems. My kids used to school in a more premium preschool. We transferred to First Step after we shifted to MacPherson. The issues we experienced in the former preschool is also evident here in First Steps. The lack of teachers, high attrition rate, good teachers leaving, not enough updates, poor management and politics amongst teachers. We've seen all these in the previous school and First Steps and we've heard similar stories from friends from other schools too. So parents, just take a chill pill. Please be grateful that in this school your kids are fed (4 times a day), soiled diapers and clothes are changed and your child isn't abused like other premium preschool. The school is trying it's best to provide the kids with a well rounded education. Outdoor play, excursions and enrichments are all provided.

"""Our journey with the school started back in 2018 when my elder son was enrolled at 8 months and we have never looked back. The school has always been a safe haven for our boys to grow and learn. It is apparent that the teachers genuinely care for the children - when they were first enrolled as infants, the teachers took great care to understand their habits and routines and when they grew older, they put in the same effort to cultivate their individuality. The curriculum is also designed in a way that is fun and enriching. We love the weekly updates and feel extremely grateful that our boys are in the safe hands of the teachers while we work.

"Placed my elder child on the waiting list for First Steps (previously known as Zion Kids) since I was pregnant as this place was strongly recommended by my friend. We did not change child care even after moving away as my children really loved their time here, and the other child care centres I had visited for consideration just paled in comparison. My younger child just graduated last year, and missed being in this wonderful school. The infant care was great, with the teachers and aunties not only taking care of their needs but also educating them, and kept the parents updated on their daily progress. When they moved over from the Zion babies to the Zion kids side, they had more structured curriculum on top of the treasured play time, which made the transition to primary school academically easy. The teachers were all loving and nurturing, instilling good values in the children. There were frequent updates on what the children were doing, and many pictures that became treasured memories of all the fun times they had learning and playing together. The meals were well planned, balanced and nutritious, with my children telling me their favourite meals and even sometimes asked for second servings. The school environment was clean, with good ventilation, which was an important consideration for me as I did not want my children falling sick frequently. The school would disinfect the whole school regularly, but would also quickly arrange for the disinfection when there were reported HFMD or COVID cases. No regrets sending my children here.

"As first time parents, First Steps really helped us to ease in to sending our child to infantcare. We didn't know what to expect, but the school was very hands-on and gave us a great helping hand in our child's development. They started the process of weaning her to solids, as well as monitoring when she became mobile enough to start playing with the older babies, subsequently moving her to a group where she could interact and play more with other children of the same age. The teachers were so kind and patient with her, and she enjoyed going to school every day... Absolutely no tears at the door!

The school will send regular updates about the kids and will provide a lot of support to the kids when they are unwell.

The school instils good values in their students and advocate a loving and nurturing environment which is important for the development of the kids. The Principal and Teachers are very receptive to feedback and work closely with the parents. Teachers also provide regular updates on the kids. The school is clean and it takes hygiene very seriously.

Also, my younger son didn’t contract COVID in school though he had teacher and classmates who got it. Academics wise, the school prepared them well for Primary 1.

"To be honest, as a first time mum 5 years ago, I was only expecting the school to just feed and bath the kids, and perhaps monitor them as they play. But no no no, I was all wrong! I am so impressed that their curriculum focuses on learning through play and themes, and what’s important is that they instil the right values through love, grace and kindness. Parents are also kept updated frequently via the WhatsApp group chat photos and announcements. I am extremely thankful to the teachers as they have significantly shaped Valerie to who she is today. We recently also sent our son to the toddler class. Knowing and acknowledging that he’s a slow learner as compared to his sister, we didn’t expect much from the school... However, the teacher advised that we should start doing checks and enrol him in early intervention classes. After months of hospital visits, we realised that his problem is those huge ear waxes stuck in his ears! We got them removed and as of today, I am impressed to see how much my boy has progressed!

"""Not worth the exorbitant school fees, if you ask me. My biggest gripe is with the diet. Children were often fed empty carbs such as mantou with no filling, or suspiciously green pandan bao. Refined, processed sugar too, such as Milo. The meals are not prepared in school but in a central kitchen, transported to Vanda and reheated. Etonhouse prides itself on its mandarin program, but in my opinion it is no use to teach children tang poems and SanZiJing when they have no idea what they are reciting or even just the context within which these poems were written. During our time with Etonhouse there was a high turnover of Chinese teachers — 3 in a year. We chose this school in part because it had a big, beautiful outdoor space (albeit right beside a big traffic intersection) but it was so underutilized. Children did not play outdoors daily, even in good weather. Granted, this was during the pandemic, but if they can be in a classroom together I see little reason why they cannot spend time outdoors. The facilities at this school were often broken. Almost every time there was a thunderstorm there would be a power outage. There were also a few times when the toilet facilities broke. There are some good ideas, such as a communication booklet with which you could correspond with your child’s class teacher. But guess what — our questions and comments in the book were never responded to or acknowledged. I think etonhouse does try to prepare children for local primary schools (get ready for weekly spelling and tingxie at age 5!) but for the money EH charges, the diet and state of the facilities are just unacceptable. Fees increased by ~200 right after we left the school. It feels like we are paying for EH’s PR efforts and head offices, rather than for the well-being of our little ones.",0.08358058608058606,Topic 1,"['school', 'child', 'time', 'teacher', 'centre', 'day', 'parent', 'son', 'month', 'kid', 'bad', 'baby', 'principal', 'cry', 'send', 'like', 'know', 'money', 'enrol', 'feel']",EtonHouse Pre-School Pte Ltd (Vanda)

"My daughter 4yo and my son 2yo have been with Eshkol Valley since their PG age from 18mo. I have so much comfort from the teacher as anxious parent on how my daughter will adapt being separated from me to start her first day. The first 2 weeks was tough, my daughter would cry and throw out due to crying but teachers and the aunties there were so assuring and told me it’s okay and it’s normal. They are so patient to say it’s okay to needing to change her daily and mop the mess my daughter created due to all her crying. The daily updates from principal/teacher via WhatsApp (now they have school communicate and photo sharing App) on how my daughter are doing for the first two weeks helped me to have a peace of mind and assurance. My daughter adapted and less crying very quicker than I imagined it would be. She have learned so much in speech, identifying, socialising, writing, trying to read words, etc in English and even improved so much in her Mandarin. My spouse and I seen how our daughter grew to become so independent and the things she learnt there are really broad and sometime in our opinion deep for her age, example identifying all the planets and remembers them, saying all the shapes include ‘rhombus shape’. etc. We too have our son joined the sister and seen him grew in fast pace especially in speech. My son went through a tough 1 week of separation anxiety too but very comfortably adapted to it after and love going to school. Seeing him so comfortably walking in as if he entered his second home felt very comforting. I love how the curriculum involve parents and children time to accomplish a task. It helps us to bond with our kids and also create meaningful moments and conversation around doing homecraft together. All the teachers are so dedicated. Their love and care for the children can be seen on how they update you about your children.

"4 years is a long time for a 6yo! That’s how long My girl has been spending most of her life fruitfully thus far! While many focus only on the so call pedagogy and brand, few actually experience the fruits and returns from the most established of the brood. EV@sengkang pearl is a rare gem that stands out among the lot. When we first moved to the neighbourhood, like most parents, the hunt for a preschool ( or rather, nightmare) begun. We were either put off or turned away by the overpopulated preschools in the northeast region and the journey was disappointing, to say the least. But as if guided by divine direction, we stumbled upon the “land flowing with milk and honey”, or Eshkol Valley in the bible (confessedly, I missed that in my own bible studies..). I must say that the first tour-around experience was the best, not becoz of over-promising or any dazzling opulence to the exterior, but the sincerity, warmth and now well behaved the kids were! Definitely sending! In the four years, I saw how my girl with some speech delays initially overcame her challenges and is now able to read Roald Dahl, Enid blyton!the improvement is stellar.

But instead, their teachers actively supported us, even to the point of looking for books that covered topics about moving and attending new schools.

My car used to scratch by the neighbor's next door automatic gate when I was there to drop my kid. Facilities: No improvement or renovation for the facilities at all over the 4 years my kid was with them (Wall painting doesn't count). Same old playground, toys/equipment was used in the center. Only added toy is used tyres. However the school fee just continues to increase every 2 years. Enrichment: Only Phonics is useful and with certain Quality. English Speech and Drama: Normal and nothing special. Chinese Speech and Drama: In order to 'lure' my kid to join the Chinese S&D, they told the kid you get to draw (knowing that my kid loves drawing). So, I enrolled my kid for the first year. However, the teacher was seen scolding and shouting at the kids before the school concert, which obviously just want to showcase her ' good work', but not really letting the kids to enjoy the class. Thus, withdrawing my kid from the class after since. Calligraphy: Calligraphy for kids who can't even write properly with a pencil. I learned Calligraphy too, and the pre-requisite is always to be at least P3 for my time. I didn't know kids nowadays have evolved so much to be able to take on this at such early age. My personal encounter: My kid was lucky enough to be taught by one of the ex-teachers, and she was a very committed teacher, which my kid's Chinese has improved over the 3 years with her. However, the English teacher was not professional enough and not equipped with the correct skill (The teacher is still with the center). During the PTC, when I asked the teacher how we can work together to improve some of my kid’s skill, the teacher told me ""I don't know how to handle your kid, I am not an expert"". When I feedback this to the principal, the answer from the principal is that you cannot expect all teachers to be so committed like the Chinese teacher.

"I cannot express enough how fortunate we feel to have found this infant care center. The principal and teachers genuine care for the children create an atmosphere that is both nurturing and supportive.

The staff's commitment to creating a safe and enriching environment is truly commendable. Our baby not only enjoys going to the infant care center but thrives under the attentive care of these professionals. It's heartwarming to witness the positive impact they have on our child's development. As parents, we couldn't ask for a better place for our baby to grow and learn.

"My son joined Children’s Cove Sembawang Shopping Centre last December. It’s the best decision I have made for him. I have visited several childcare centres before I settled on Children’s Cove. The student-teacher ratio is the lowest with a ratio of 6 to 1 for playgroup. This childcare centre is also relatively new in operation during the Covid pandemic in 2021 and they have further expanded recently. Being new means that all the facilities are clean and in good conditions, all the classrooms and common areas are nicely decorated with warmly theme and child appropriate educational toys. The centre has also employed 2 aunties, 1 for the cooking and 1 for general cleaning. Hygiene level is always their priority. At the other end of the school is a door which directly opens and leads to the building’s playground. Communication with the teachers is prompt via the apps. They keep us updated with photos during the weekly update and on ah-hoc basis whenever interesting moments of my son occur. My son’s main teacher-in-charge is a very assuring teacher who is bubbly, meticulous and always willing to go to the extra miles to ensure my little son and all children are safe, sound, happy and on track to reach their development milestones. His Chinese teacher is a very enthusiastic lady who spices the class with excitement, engages and sparks the curiosity of my son to learn. I have no issue to address any concerns to the teachers promptly. This is a close-knit community. The teachers are bonded to the children, parents and among each other. I like how thoughtful the principal and teachers are, for instance, arranging to dress up in same colour code during excursion for easy recognition or even having flower petals on their hair which was just to create little spices for the Parents' Day event. The teachers are more like a guardian and a friend than a service provider. A heartfelt thank you to Teacher Jie Ying and Zheng Lao Shi for spending their time, energy and love to shape my child’s development for the better. A sincere appreciation to the rest of the team under the leadership of Ms San, and especially to Yang Lao Shi, Hu Lao Shi and Teacher Eunice for taking care of my son despite not in their classes. All in all, I have no regrets sending my son to Children’s Cove, Sembawang Shopping Centre.

Every day, when I drop her off, the teachers are all smiles, which makes me feel good about leaving her there. Willow never gets bored because they have lots of hands-on activities. And it's a close-knit community, so the kids have become good friends, and I've made friends with other parents too. I visited quite a number of childcare centres two years ago, but I'm soooo glad I picked Children's Cove.

"I Attended Cherie Hearts during the years of 2009 to 2013 and it left many fond memories and fun times, my teachers (from nursery to k2) were especially caring and helpful. I Really appreciated the support and help the teachers gave me and my friends, making sure we understood the lessons and made sure we ate enough and slept enough as well. I was able to make many friends there as the classes usually required us to have some group works and projects which helped instill values such as unity and empathy to better understand my classmates and build relationships. These values carried on into my primary school days and even now as i’m a young adult, I really felt included and appreciated among friends and teachers there. The food was nicely cooked and always served on time, they also give us time for play which was very much appreciated. Helping us stay active and make friends through our play.

The attention and love from the teachers are genuine and sincere, attested by the gifts they give from their own expenses to my boys and other kids. When my boys had issues adjusting especially during early days in the playgroup, Brands the Centre director and teachers gave me regular updates and photos to assure us how they are doing and put them inside the office to ensure they are comfortable and not disturbing other kids. They do this when the boys are unwell or need calming down due to adjustment / separation issues, Brands or any teacher would be inside to keep them company and ensure their safety.

"Hi, my son attended this childcare many years back however I remembered it vividly. I was told the incidents of HFMD was minimal however the exact month my son was there, he was down with HFMD, and on the 3rd month too. During one incident when he was down with fever, the teacher locked him up in the room on L2 till dismissal (when they should have just called us to pick him up earlier). Few months later, we observed bruise marks on his arms on a few occasions. The principal and teacher said it’s due to “play with other students”. After so many unpleasant incidents, we decided to forego the deposit and take my boy out from Cherie Hearts at Charlton. How would we even want to continue that last month (after reporting these unpleasant incidents to the principal and teacher)? These kind of experiences can leave scars on children for years! In fact, they even leave psychological scars / guilt on parents - I’ll think why I gave this childcare centre so many chances? What else happened to my kid (prior to my discovery?). Could all these be avoided if only I trusted my gut feel, (as well as granny’s observation outside the centre) and take him out earlier? Am so glad nowadays, the policing of childcare sector is more stringent. There’s definitely a lot of improvements in the childcare space! Why I’m sharing this review is because of a Straits Times article today about similar incident which happened to a 3yr old boy, (which ignited the bad memories).

"My boy’s graduating from Cherie Hearts at Charlton this year. Looking back, I have no regrets with choosing this place to be his second home. When we first enquired with the school, we dropped in to pay a visit to view the place and see how the students and teachers were. This was a few years ago, but I recall the elements of safety in the premises and willingness to inculcate lessons on things like recycling on top of the regular curriculum stood out for me. The school itself, I like that it’s an actual house instead of some unit in an office area or a void deck. It gives the children a nicer environment to be in. They also have regular trips to the nearby park so the kids get fresh air and are in a safe and quiet area all day too. I feel like my boy has learnt plenty from the curriculum. But beyond that, activities that encourage Green initiatives and creativity have helped nurture him in other ways apart from just the academic. If you are curious about enrichment options, there are plenty. From football, to ballet, to art, to abacus, there are options for different skill sets and it’s all conducted in-house, so it’s also great for parents who don’t have the logistics to send their kids to another place for extra classes. Over the years, I’ve been both impressed and keen to join in on trips and excursions for the kids, just to be a part of their activities and bond with my boy more. The more educational ones have been interesting, but the more “fun” ones like the big cycling events and the K2 camp were really great to join or spy on the kids from afar. The school also gives termly reports on your child’s progress, but will also reach out to you whenever necessary to update you on your kid’s happenings in school if required. They are transparent and open with their communications to you, so you can feel at ease. They truly work with you too. My boy will miss coming to this school for many reasons - his friends, his teachers, the staff, the place too. I will also miss attending their events with my boy and other parent-friends too. Your kid will also learn to ride a bicycle pretty fast when you get to K2 with the school! Also, Congratulations to Ms. Brands Ng and the whole school for hitting 20 years!

"The teachers here are quite friendly and go the extra mile to make sure the children feel comfortable. The first week my son was at the facility he was quite shy and his pre nursery teacher helped him feel at ease throughout his first week and onwards. I also noticed a lot of growth in my son after starting, I feel like their teaching is very productive. Another thing that my son likes is their excursions, the school sometimes will bring the children on outings for trips to places, be it the farms, to memorials, firestations, etc and it is something the parents can opt to do with them as well that the kids enjoy a lot.

Just a few months into their(our kids) 1st years in school, we noticed a vast improvement in language, motor skills and attitude towards learning. I feel the Teachers there exudes a certain level of passion, and love for nurturing children, that they sincerely care and wants the best for each child.

Love that this school has cctv, we can check out what the kids are up to throughout the day. Our experience has been very positive! Ms Ng knows her kids very well and would not hesitate to help and assist when we need. They put in great effort to help the kids adjust especially when my boy took a long time to overcome the separation during his first month at school. Many updates via WA throughout the day making sure he is well taken care of. For younger classes, they also make sure at least one teacher from the previous year would follow the kids up to the next class so that the kids would have a familiar teacher in the new level. I love that they offer enrichment classes in the school itself so my boy can attend extra classes within school without us having to ferry him to external enrichment lessons.

"My parents enrolled me into Cherie Hearts @Charlton when I was 2 years old. I was with them all the way until when I went into P1. All the teachers there were very friendly and taught me lots of interesting stuff, like drawing, simple mathematics, etc. I remembered there was even a once-a-week water play, where we mass around with water and throw water bombs around. Can't remember what's it called. But that was fun! I remember there was even an overseas trip together with the teachers to JB where we spent one night at LegoLand. That was a very memorable trip for me. I was there for 5 years and I truly enjoyed my time there.

"I like to give a shout out (in appreciation) to Ms Ng , all Teachers and staff at CH@charlton. My older daughter (who is currently in P1 now) joined them mid-way in K1 from another “premium” preschool. At that time, her literacy and reading skills in both languages were poor. With help from the Teachers and their reading program, she made tremendous improvements by term 3 in K2. She even knows hanyu pinyin better than me! Now that she’s in P1, she has no issues in reading, spelling or 听写 because CH@charlton has prepared her well. CH@charlton also has fun activities like messy day (water play), Surin park day and K2 graduation camp which my daughter enjoyed and misses till this day.

"I finally found you Ms Inez. What happen to your post on Cherie Hearts Singapore FB review? You shared your comments & i did so likewise. I have the videos of you (1) storming into the school compound, (2) behaved rudely to the teachers and (3) u fell mainly because of careless. I wanted to post it for many to review but u deleted your post before I can do so. Nevertheless, I have printed screen shots of your comment in this review, implying my kids to be “Selfish, self centered & inconsiderate”. To many out there, this lady, Ms Inez, choose to walk this path (nearest to school) during peak hours where many parents drop their kids to school everyday. The school is located within a landed cluster and in order to prevent traffic congestion, at each time 2 cars need to inch over the pavement to allow other cars to drive through. Fyi (1) there is another exit point approx less than 15m (approx less than 15 steps) away & (2) the exit thats nearest to the school was applied by the school director by means of official application & approval for parents who commute to school by means of public transport or foot. In the video, you will be able to observe that the paveway though obstructed marginally by the cars, theres still ample space for both abled and disabled man to walk through with ease. If I were to describe, even a hippopotamus can scroll through with ease. Also in the video, you will be able to observe her making statements to the teachers while walking away. She didn’t observe her path and obstacles and that led to her falling down like a log & sustained abrasion on her knee as reflected in her previous Fb posting. In a nut shell, everything didn’t fall in place for her that morning & she blamed the school for everything. What kind of human is this.. the more I see her comments implying my kids to be a potential delinquent, the angrier I get! I am seriously looking into pursue legal action on her. I bet this is a very STOMP worthy video too. The teachers in this school are considerate, kind & Importantly, Caring to my/our kids.

"My son 2.5 year old son attended Playgroup at Chatsworth Preschool at Piccadilly in May 2023. Unfortunately, our experience has been deeply disappointing, prompting me to share these concerns on Google Review. Within just two weeks of enrolment, we received an email highlighting issues with his adaptation, leading to a premature assessment and labelling. Despite my efforts to address these concerns with the school, including a phone call with Principal Ms. Farah, I felt dismissed and pressured to withdraw my son during our conversation. Subsequently, we received regular negative emails from form teachers and Principal Farah, despite evidence of my son's progress, supported by videos I provided. A distressing face-to-face meeting in September 2023. The atmosphere during the meeting was uncomfortable, with Ms. Linda the admin person appearing stand-offish. An ultimatum was given to my son by Ms Linda saying that he would not be promoted and demanded us to withdraw him immediately. This experience has left us profoundly upset and raises concerns about the professionalism of the staff especially considering the school's approach to child development and parental collaboration. Nevertheless, we also brought our son to seek professional assessments from various therapists and they found NO Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) symptoms, contradicting what the Chatsworth staff blindly suggest (without explicit confirmation) that has contributed to an unwarranted urgency to remove my son from the school. In my plea to let my son stay on in school, I agreed to try out therapy to address concerns. I've requested time, explaining that early intervention takes time to show results, but an unreasonable ultimatum was given, stating he must show compliance by November, which anybody will know is an unachievable goal within a two-month timeframe. More communication consistently emphasized potential conditions such as ASD and ADHD, causing unnecessary stress without proper confirmation from qualified professionals. This approach not only demonstrated a lack of empathy but also significantly impacted the overall well-being of my son and our family. The final and perhaps most absurd blow came when I recently discovered that despite our decision to withdraw my son at the end of 2023, the school has chosen to keep him separated from his classmates, placing him in the playgroup classroom. *This decision was never communicated to us as parents. While I understand speech and developmental delays that my son has, it's distressing that my son is not allowed to be with his friends for the remaining month. Placing him in a playgroup classroom seems unnecessarily isolating and contradicts a supportive environment and this isolation is an act of discrimination I decided to reach out to the HQ, and after two phone call conversations with the center manager Yvonne, I received conflicting responses. On the first call, she suggested she will do an investigation because she agreed with me that 'the school should not have mishandled this situation and that more time should be given to a 2.5 year old, acknowledging it's too early to judge especially when boys develop slower' , while the second phone call ( the next day ) she stated, 'there is nothing we can do, and I will choose to trust my team.' This is vastly different from her initial stance which left us dumbfounded. I actually came to a compromise and suggest to the centre manager Yvonne that I am fine with him being with unfamiliar younger playgroup kids but could she maybe allow him to join his batch of friends for activity time so at least he gets to learn something during his remaining time there, meanwhile for day to day routines he can be with younger group if that means making 'life easier for the teachers'. But alas, she told me no. Even this, she was not able to do. I actually feel sad for my son, and helpless as a mother, there is nothing I could do to stand up for him. Leaving this review is our last resort, as we want to prevent others from going through what we experienced.",-0.011274509803921568,Topic 5,"['teacher', 'school', 'child', 'kid', 'care', 'good', 'love', 'thank', 'parent', 'principal', 'staff', 'learn', 'son', 'daughter', 'year', 'environment', 'great', 'preschool', 'ms', 'experience']",Chatsworth Preschool - Piccadilly Campus

She is a firm teacher yet handle all children differently. She knows how to manage both our children differently as she truly understands that all child are different. Lastly, Tevie transit to Primary 1 and Ellie transfer to another Carpe diam.

How can we ever forget “Roti platter, sticky rice!” I found the management compassionate, really supportive & considerate about days & holidays etc. They were happy to make changes to certain days of care during our settling in period & made our lives much easier during a difficult few months. Initially we put the children in for temporary care but we extended their stay to full time & found it very hard to leave, in the end it was sadly abit too far for us to travel to and from each day. However we are still in contact with the wonderful teachers Ms Hani & Ms Fiza who were so caring & professional throughout. I couldn’t recommend Camelot highly enough.

"My child has attended this pre school for the last 2 years. The first year was relatively okay given the caring and attentiveness of the teachers. However as he progressed to the next grade, the turnover of the teachers became very high and there were several incidents of favoritism and unprofessional behavior of the teachers towards students. What is more intolerable is the unprofessional attitude of the principal, whose defensive nature often brushes away the concerns of the parents. What is more appalling is the business-minded attitude of this principal who did not even bother to acknowledge us when we decided to withdraw our child. That 180 degree change in attitude tells us that this is a pre school whose philosophy is based on one single thing and that is money. Our child is fortunate to make many good friends who have eventually decided to leave this school as well. One can only hope that with the new principal will infuse strong ethical principles worthy of a professional educator. Update: In a desperate bid to retain the students, the school has dished out rebates/discounts to the remaining students in an inconsistent manner that is not transparent. Again, this has proven that the school is only focused on monetary value and not on professional or educational enhancements for the children. We are glad our child has finally left this school.",0.18358406926406926,Topic 5,"['teacher', 'school', 'child', 'kid', 'care', 'good', 'love', 'thank', 'parent', 'principal', 'staff', 'learn', 'son', 'daughter', 'year', 'environment', 'great', 'preschool', 'ms', 'experience']",Cambridge @ Serangoon Gardens Pte Ltd

"Here’s sharing my heartiest thanks and gratitude to Cambridge @ Serangoon Gardens from the heart of an aunt! My niece and nephew are students at this school, and my family would like to sincerely and ardently thank the teachers and Principal Irene for their genuine love and meticulous care for each of their students! I remember when my niece first started swimming lessons in K1 last year, she was very scared of the water and didn’t want to go for the swimming classes. Qiu Yi Lao Shi encouraged her not to be scared and scaffolded her, sitting beside her near the swimming pool first to encourage her to get familiar with the environment while her classmates had their swimming lessons. The next time, Qiu Yi Lao Shi encouraged my niece to dip her feet in the waters. Slowly but surely, my niece gained courage and joined in subsequent swimming lessons. She’s now a little radiant and enthusiastic swimmer and guess what her favourite subject in school is? It is SWIMMING! Thank you Qiu Yi Lao Shi for believing in her and seeing potential in her! Qiu Yi Lao Shi is also now the teacher of my younger nephew in N1 this year. I admire and thank her, Teacher Ran and Lu Lao Shi for taking care of him and the young students so, so, so well! They are extremely attentive to their students’ needs, give us advice and tips, and have enormous amounts and oodles of stamina in taking care of the students everyday. Wow.

We received timely feedback on what she did well and areas she could improve on. She has now transited to primary 1 and is adapting very well which I believe is due to wholesome curriculum (iSTEAM, English and Chinese literacy programs).

"A school led by a principal with little integrity and teachers with poor communication and great defensive skills. My child attended school for almost a year. Prior to attending school, she had never developed diaper rash before. Diaper rash was a recurring issue since the beginning of school. I had to take leave initially to nurse her skin back. Only to have her develop diaper rash again when she returned back to school. We tried very hard each time to nurse her skin back over the weekend, only to have the diaper rash recur again on a Monday. The teachers were mostly defensive and pushed the blame to extrinsic factors like wrong diaper brand, wrong wet wipe, wrong cream. FYI, there were the very same ones we had been using since she was born. It improved for 3 months somewhere down the road after we made a big fuss about it when it got to a point where her rash was so bad. We got her seen by a Dermatologist who identified the cause as poor hygiene due to infrequent diaper change. From then on, she develops diaper rash every now and then and her skin will be all good for 1-2months after each time we make a complaint. The last straw was when she developed diaper rash again after promoting to N1. Being under a new team of teachers, we do understand that it takes awhile for them to grasp the care of each individual child. However, the response that ticked me off was from Teacher Sha where she quoted that they have already been changing it very promptly and frequently for my child. Even more regularly compared to other children in the same class. She gave me an ultimatum, it is either we No. 1 change doctor, no. 2 change diaper brand or no. 3 change the diaper cream we're using. I went for option 4, change school. Had the teachers be alittle more empathetic and apologetic and less defensive in their tone, we probably would have stayed on. Then came the last issue just before we completed the last month notice in the school, where the school FAILED to notify us of the HFMD cases even though my child was technically still a student there. In my conversation with Principal Irene over the phone to clarify this matter, she even lied about the timing the communication app was disabled, stating that it was only late evening when in fact ECDA wrote back stating it was at noon. (Refer to photos for email records of me writing in to ECDA and Cambridge Head Office). No sense of social responsibility at all, they simply don't care since child will not be returning to their school anyway. Aside to all these, some other minor issues are like very little update and upload of photos. Their teacher to student ratio is also not as good as what was marketed during the pre-enrolment phase. We have only met ONE good teacher in our journey with Cambridge, Teacher Denise. She demonstrated that she genuinely cared for the children and has excellent communication skills when it comes to reassuring us parents. It was a pity to have her leave the school. I guess there is a reason why good teachers choose to leave. Overall, I find no sense in paying a premium for a school of this quality. There is a reason why there is always a vacancy in this school when everything else in the vicinity is full.

It is heartening to leave this school as I truly could feel teachers' cares from few parent's events. The school update school activities and daily care quite timely (almost end of every day).

But it is understandable as the school doesn't encourage parents to always pick up late and left their babies anxious at school. Sometimes, the teachers may mistakenly put on other baby's diaper but once it is addressed, they rectify it immediately. Overall, we're quite satisfied with the school and looking forward to come back if our bb is not used to new school.",0.060301426968093624,Topic 5,"['teacher', 'school', 'child', 'kid', 'care', 'good', 'love', 'thank', 'parent', 'principal', 'staff', 'learn', 'son', 'daughter', 'year', 'environment', 'great', 'preschool', 'ms', 'experience']",Cambridge @ MacPherson

Just had a very pleasant school tour at the infant care and childcare about 2 weeks ago. The infant bay looks nice and spacious and feels quite inviting. The Principal shared about the transition procedure for infants to childcare and their success stories and I felt quite assured. My friend's child is also in the Toddler class and she said her child settled really fast and is now very happy going to school. My friend speaks fondly of the class teachers as well. I will be placing my baby next year when she is much older and hope she will transit to preschool smoothly!

Both of my kids studied here for 3 years. Overall is a nice preschool.,0.3,Topic 5,"['teacher', 'school', 'child', 'kid', 'care', 'good', 'love', 'thank', 'parent', 'principal', 'staff', 'learn', 'son', 'daughter', 'year', 'environment', 'great', 'preschool', 'ms', 'experience']",Cambridge @ MacPherson
"I do not recommend this preschool at all. There was a change in management 1-2 months after my child started infant care and things only got worse. My child's items were frequently misplaced even after I have labelled them and other children's items also got placed into my child's bag (e.g LABELLED soiled clothes and milk bottles, breast milk bottles, socks). I continued to put up with this because I felt that the teachers were quite ok and my child seemed to enjoy school. However, when my child turned 12 months, she suffered 4 bruises to her head within a span of less than 1 calendar month. One of the incidents was not even reported to me until I approached the school to ask about the bruise. The school claimed that this was a miscommunication and there was ZERO apologies made for this incident. I had to ask to speak to management about the frequent injuries and the school pushed the blame to my child for being fussy/difficult instead. Some pointers for potential parents to consider: 1. The most serious of the bruises was caused by a half door banging into my child's forehead. Apparently the teachers frequently close the door behind them without looking out for infants behind. Management said they have tried to ask the teachers to correct this action to no avail. You may interpret this however you like. 2. My child was in the centre from 3m to 12m. How is it possible that during this whole time, she could not be accustomed to more than 1 or 2 teachers? Did the teachers try enough to engage her? FYI she does not have this problem in her new school and her new teachers mentioned that this could be due to being insecure. 3. 2 of the bruises were caused by her head hitting furniture/doors. It is basic for an infant care centre to be childproof right? There are clearly lapses in childproof in the centre but the management maintains that my child (and one other child at most) are the only child that injured themselves instead of admitting that they need to look into further childproofing. 4. My child was supposed to transition to older infant group for 12 - 18m (which has a lower teacher:child ratio if 1:4 instead of 1:3 in case you also did not know) but this transition was delayed due to shortage of manpower at the older infant side. My personal belief is that this also contributed to my child's injury because she was not being engaged sufficiently at the younger infant group and hence wanted to stick to her preferred teacher. 5. My child has eczema and had to wear socks (with grip sole) to protect the wound. The centre said this caused my child to fall as being barefooted has better grip. In comparison, the new school said socks are a requirement for all children. Please interpret this as you wish. This centre has caused a lot of grief for me as I had to transfer my child out with less than 6 months to go in infant care. I regret not transferring my child out earlier. If you are unhappy with the care your child is receiving, I suggest you consider a transfer ASAP.",-0.0012544273907910332,Topic 1,"['school', 'child', 'time', 'teacher', 'centre', 'day', 'parent', 'son', 'month', 'kid', 'bad', 'baby', 'principal', 'cry', 'send', 'like', 'know', 'money', 'enrol', 'feel']",Cambridge @ MacPherson
"Send your child here at your own peril - this should be a 0 star review if possible Abysmal childcare standards - notwithstanding the frequent loss & mix-up of personal belongings which is already a huge red flag, my child under Cambridge’s infant care had to be put through/suffer serious negligence/“abuse” where the teachers knowingly cause her to be injured on a number of occasions. Irresponsible + lack of accountability of management/principal/teachers - shirking responsibility after being questioned regarding the frequent occurrence of my child’s bruises/injuries by callously/conveniently blaming it on the child’s “energy”, albeit a 12 month old. Besides other unacceptable/questionable issues such as high teacher turnover and absenteeism resulting in poor teacher-child ratio, the above 2 mentioned points are already a dealbreaker. A clear observation can be made from the exodus of children and teachers over the past 1 year - does not take a genius to understand why there are always vacancies at Cambridge despite the overwhelming demand in the area due to the Bidadari estate.

"""As a parent deeply invested in providing a holistic and enriching educational experience for my child, enrolling them in a Montessori school has been a game-changer. The Montessori philosophy is not just a method of education; it's a transformative journey that fosters independence, creativity, and a love for learning. One of the standout features of our Montessori experience is the child-centric approach that permeates every aspect of the curriculum. The classrooms are carefully designed to stimulate curiosity and exploration. The materials used are not just tools for learning; they are gateways to discovery. Watching my child engage with the carefully crafted Montessori materials, I can see the joy and enthusiasm that comes with hands-on learning. The teachers at our Montessori school play a pivotal role in creating a nurturing environment. They act as guides, fostering a sense of responsibility and self-discipline. The emphasis on respecting each child's pace of development has allowed my child to progress at their own speed, building a strong foundation for future academic success. What sets Montessori apart is the emphasis on practical life skills. From pouring their own juice to cleaning up after themselves, children are encouraged to take ownership of their actions. This not only instills a sense of responsibility but also enhances fine and gross motor skills. Witnessing my child confidently tackle daily tasks has been immensely rewarding. The community aspect of Montessori education cannot be understated. The mixed-age classrooms encourage collaboration and mentorship among students. Younger children learn from their older peers, while the older ones reinforce their understanding by teaching. This dynamic fosters a sense of community and creates a supportive learning environment. Communication between parents and teachers is open and transparent. Regular parent-teacher meetings provide insights into our child's progress, allowing us to actively participate in their educational journey. The Montessori school doesn't just educate children; it educates parents, creating a partnership that enhances the overall learning experience. In conclusion, our Montessori experience has been nothing short of exceptional. It goes beyond traditional education, nurturing the whole child – mind, body, and spirit. The emphasis on independence, hands-on learning, and community engagement sets Montessori apart as a beacon of educational excellence. If you're seeking an educational journey that inspires a love for learning and prepares your child for a lifetime of success, a Montessori education is undoubtedly worth considering.",0.22675438596491235,Topic 5,"['teacher', 'school', 'child', 'kid', 'care', 'good', 'love', 'thank', 'parent', 'principal', 'staff', 'learn', 'son', 'daughter', 'year', 'environment', 'great', 'preschool', 'ms', 'experience']",Brighton Montessori Centres Pte Ltd (Mountbatten)

"BSC has been an integral part of my daughter's growth, from a 20-month-old child, when she was unable to communicate verbally, to the confident, talkative and - most importantly - kind and loving person she is today. I especially adore: - the teacher's approach in resolving conflict between the children - the way they instil kindness and do-your-best mindset in their daily activities - the healthy meal they prepare for my child Their approach in educating the children is aligned with our approach at home, and very often we are also exchanging notes on how we should tackle certain issues pertaining to our child's behavior. Great childcare is not just about looking after children, it should be an extension of the family - where the teacher and other staff members, from those that prepare meals to those that manage and run the centre, put in extra effort to ensure the children get the love and care they need.

"My eldest graduated half a year ago and my youngest is still with Blossom. They enjoy Blossom tremendously. I love fetching them from Blossom, listening to them chat about what they learn and enjoy in school. My eldest really struggled with phonics in her kindy years and her form teacher worked closely with me to support her in grasping reading. She was aware of my eldest’s introverted personality and took into consideration of that while teaching her. My girl breezed through reading by graduation. Blossom is also aware of the struggle parents have with Chinese language and has done up a solid curriculum to help children transit to P1 Chinese well. My eldest still enjoys singing with her younger sister of the Chinese songs and poems her blossom teachers have taught her. Blossom teachers really make learning fun for them! Academic aside, the thing that really stands out for me for Blossom is the teachers. They are warm and caring and are often able to quickly give feedback on my children whether it is during PTM or casual chatting during pick up, which reflect their understanding and love for my children. My younger girl is a slow eater and gets stressed when her peers finish before her. She would tell me how her teacher assures and comforts her during meal time. This was also communicated to me by the teachers. This is but one of the many examples of the care the teachers take in my children.

"This is a very well-run school with clear management and structure as well as a deep passion and love for kids and their education. My daughter’s passion for life, school, the teachers and her school friends say it all. Blossom is exactly what kids do at this school. Our daughter has been attending since 2018, we love Blossom Creative Bedok and could not recommend more highly. Not convinced? Please read about our experience  Finding a school for your playgroup/kindergarten age child can be incredibly stressful. I have 4 kids and each time round I was just as nervous. My youngest was not. She was adamant she wanted to go to Blossom Creative Centre Bedok. She had seen it walking past and was sure that is where she wanted to go. I arranged to see the school and was convinced in 30 seconds that she had made a super choice. A very well thought out syllabus, clear objectives but also a more holistic approach ensuring kids get play, art, music and fun too. Her first day she walked in and didn’t even look back. Every day I pick her up and ask “how was your day?” her reply is “great!”. She is on a half day but some days asks to do a long day she has so much fun. Blossom really was the greatest find! The location is such a wonderful space, with a garden to play, a nice welcoming entrance and Teachers that greet with warm and wonderful smiles. Even through COVID the community feel/support between parents and the school has been beyond words. We love the Teachers! Their personal touch and effort to build relationships is evident from how my daughter adores them but their passion does not stop there. They use creative ways to teach the kids; music, activities, games, and crafts. So much effort goes into what they do. Even with COVID the Teachers have found ways to work within the restrictions and safely, but give the kids experiences they love and will remember. From role play to experience what life is like as an older person to learning about the ocean and making paper jellyfish, self expression, singing, cooking, dancing, writing, reading, numbers, Mandarin, science, computers, physical education and more; Blossom Creative have it covered. Having been there for a few years now I can vouch for their approach. My child has learnt more than I could have imagined. She comes home telling me facts that even my older kids don’t know. She loves reading and writing because Blossom Creative make it fun and have given her great ways to apply what she has learnt. We love the bilingual approach they take and the standard of teaching that ensures the kids learn what they need to.

"It is very disheartening for me to write the following review for the childcare that had been taking care of my child. When I first decided to leave my child there, the teachers were friendly and demonstrated professionalism in taking care of the children. There were regular feedback and also well establish curriculum. However, lately there were quite a few teachers who left and replaced by new ones. The teachers were not only rude but also lacks passion to teach. They tend to chit chat among themselves while leaving the children to play. The most disappointing part is that there are some teachers who literally ignore you when we are there to pick up our children. Such behaviours are disappointing for a childcare who is responsible to take care and teach our next generation.",-0.01991978609625669,Topic 5,"['teacher', 'school', 'child', 'kid', 'care', 'good', 'love', 'thank', 'parent', 'principal', 'staff', 'learn', 'son', 'daughter', 'year', 'environment', 'great', 'preschool', 'ms', 'experience']",Blossom Creative Centre (Bedok)

"""Only discovered this kindergarten when I decided to pull my younger child out of childcare in K1. Regretted not sending her in earlier and not sending my elder one in. We are in the roots and wings program (6 hour program) and on top of the extensive curriculum, enrichment is included like music, sports ball, art and speech and drama. The holistic curriculum also let them learn through play via relating real life items like trees and rocks with learning, and includes creative thinking skill. Indoor and outdoor play is also included as part of the curriculum. There is an in-house aunty who does the cooking and my daughter takes multiple bowls. The teachers are very caring and the whole environment is very loving. The education itself is secular in nature so no issues as we are not Christian.

My second one is still studying at Bethesda. The opposite of her brother, she was a very shy and quite girl. Thankfully, she manages to talk and speak more as she grows in the environment that supports her.

"""Before Baby Elk, we always hear from people around us on how infant care is a nightmare where the kid will always fall sick. But I think we must have lucked out here because being in infant care was one of the best decision we’ve made! I think it’s really the entire team behind the centre that makes all the difference. Our son started school when he was 3 months old and honestly, he didn’t cried and adapted super well. We saw how much our son loved school, to the extent that he cried on so many occasions when he was going home. He is probably the only child who isn’t happy seeing his parents at the door.. We love seeing the updates from school and knowing what activities he gets to do for the day. Daily updates were updated very promptly which gave us a peace of mind while we work. Thank you to the team once again for all the love! Caleb is indeed very lucky to have such a fun and great experience to start his school journey! Will definitely recommend Baby Elk to anyone who is looking for an infant care around AMK/YCK area.",0.2898809523809524,Topic 5,"['teacher', 'school', 'child', 'kid', 'care', 'good', 'love', 'thank', 'parent', 'principal', 'staff', 'learn', 'son', 'daughter', 'year', 'environment', 'great', 'preschool', 'ms', 'experience']",Baby Elk Infant Care Singapore

"** Updates: In response to the management's reply since I am unable to reply to it ** - 17th Sept 2020 Hi centre managers, thanks for your reply for this review. We noticed there are quite an amount of information which was left out in your reply. We will not pursue further, since you were adamant Baby Elk was entirely responsive, and you seem to be defensive against our constructive feedback. I also appreciate acknowledging messages / calls after 6 business working days (as claimed by the centre). Perhaps its basic courtesy to acknowledged and not go missing (while claiming to check) and let parents know a response will be given by a certain date? I think no parents will appreciate messages sent but no reply for more than a week, made phone calls but no response, left messages to the principal at the centre for a return call but no response. The only response came few days after a google review was posted to ask me to listen to their breakdown and to remove my google review. I felt it was not necessary anymore because ECDA stepped in and assisted me with my enquiry. Also having sufficient teachers does not meant the teachers could cope with the workload. Have been asked not once but twice if I had any recommendation for teachers who are interested to work there. Even part timers are welcomed. And there are few occasions when my baby showered only at 3pm and was told because they didnt had time. All these made me inferred they need more manpower. No? Apart from that, I saw my baby sleeping on other babies' bed and using their pillows and blankets on 3 occasions. They had put her in the wrong bed and given her the wrong items. Other babies' bath towels were also packed into my baby's bag at times. To be honest, all of the above, I can wink it off because like I said, as long as my baby is ok. Humans make mistake and I feel that there is no need to pinpoint all the nitty-gritty things. However, if the centre is so defensive that they are providing their best already, then I feel the need to highlight that these issues should not have occurred. For my whatsapp review as screenshot by the centre, I felt that they should screenshot with the date as well because what I said was much earlier before this whole lapse of response. To be honest, even at this point in time, I would still thank the teachers for guiding my baby and loving her. There are too many more situations but I feel there is no point going on. If there are any parents who would like more information about our review, feel free to reply here and we will be happy to provide our personal experiences and the proof of which was left out in the centre’s reply to our review. May 2020 Had an unpleasant journey dealing with the management of the IFC. It is tiring to constantly have to ask for updates when you have an enquiry to check on. At times, the response comes after a few days. At times, after a few weeks or completely ignored. This is especially so when it comes to refunding of the subsidy and deposit. Prior to the recruitment, they were really pro-active in getting you to join. After which is a different story. There were many loopholes of unclear communications as well. In terms of the educarers, I think there are definitely room for improvement. But I understand that the role of the educarer is not easy and they are constantly short of teachers so many things I choose to wink off as long as my baby is not injured.",0.10467205750224617,Topic 1,"['school', 'child', 'time', 'teacher', 'centre', 'day', 'parent', 'son', 'month', 'kid', 'bad', 'baby', 'principal', 'cry', 'send', 'like', 'know', 'money', 'enrol', 'feel']",Baby Elk Infant Care Singapore

"When we first moved to Dairy Farm two years ago, we were looking for a kindergarten for our son. The nearby kindergartens were either full or not satisfactory to me. Later I found this low-key kindergarten (it was in an apartment complex, and there was very little information about this kindergarten on the Internet at the time). My son has been in this kindergarten for two years. Facts have proved that choosing this kindergarten is very wise. The kindergarten is located in an apartment with a beautiful environment, isolated from the noise and pollution of the main highway. There are many windows, which can keep the air flowing well, and parents can also watch the children attending classes and playing outside the window. The teachers are very, very friendly. The children learned a lot in school and learned Chinese very well! Now that my son K2 is about to graduate, I really can’t bear to leave this kindergarten! So I leave a message here specifically to thank the teachers for their hard work, especially Jing Laoshi who has been teaching my son. I also hope that the school will get better and better. 👍",0.23215277777777774,Topic 5,"['teacher', 'school', 'child', 'kid', 'care', 'good', 'love', 'thank', 'parent', 'principal', 'staff', 'learn', 'son', 'daughter', 'year', 'environment', 'great', 'preschool', 'ms', 'experience']",Ace @ Work Childcare Pte Ltd (Cashew Heights)

I appreciate the welcome greetings in the morning from all the teachers no matter which class they were from and I love the warm welcoming energy the school have. I must also compliment the Principal, Ms Chew for putting in the effort together with the school, to come up with lots of activities and celebration for the kids. I really love the recent sports day that was held. Activities involving families is something I cherish. It’s something I get to do with my kid and the school. The school does not only have kind and loving teachers but their cook and cleaning aunties are also very nice and friendly. My daughter loves talking about Aunty Wong. And whenever we see Aunty Wong before entering school, she’ll make small conversations with my daughter and she’ll get so excited.

"My girl used to be a pickie eater and we were always worried about her weight – that has always been the main issue every time we had her doctor’s appointment. Frequent times our Dr used to say she is on the lighter side for her age and that we needed to get her to eat more. As parents, my husband and I have always tried many different ways to get her to eat more -especially on proteins like chicken, but it has never seemed to work. Surprisingly, after she had started going to school at Ms Chew’s centre, she started to eat bigger portions and she even started to eat chicken. We have seen a drastic healthy change in her weight and we are really happy with this positive change. It took us months to make her eat more but it only took the centre less than 3 weeks. Most of the time before fetching her from school, we would always peek through her class window at what she was doing and often times we noticed her teachers -Lin Laoshi, Pan Laoshi, Teacher Aishah and another Indian Assistant Teacher playing with her and her classmates. This showed that all the teachers, even the Assistant Teachers are very engaging and they would put their heart and soul to caring and entertaining the children. This of course assured me that I have sent my child to the right childcare centre. I would also like to take this time to share that I’ve really enjoyed the many celebrations that Ms Chew have included throughout the entire year and get the kids (and mummies like me) excited!

The 2-year-old baby could start from scratch. Will sing 10+ songs by the end. He is also very self-disciplined in his living habits. He does his own things and is often willing to help his family and maids with housework. I am grateful for the company of Principal Zhou and teachers who are passionate about education. I hope my baby can always learn and grow at Ace!",0.15875,Topic 5,"['teacher', 'school', 'child', 'kid', 'care', 'good', 'love', 'thank', 'parent', 'principal', 'staff', 'learn', 'son', 'daughter', 'year', 'environment', 'great', 'preschool', 'ms', 'experience']",Ace @ Work Childcare Pte Ltd (703 Choa Chu Kang St 53)
"My son didn't like going to school at first, but he has been in school for almost a year now and is very adaptable. He often speaks some Chinese that we have never taught at home, and sings Twinkle Twinkle Twinkle Twinkle and Pulling Carrots by himself, which surprises me. I asked him if he liked teachers, and he told me that he did. He said his favorite was teacher April😁",0.31,Topic 5,"['teacher', 'school', 'child', 'kid', 'care', 'good', 'love', 'thank', 'parent', 'principal', 'staff', 'learn', 'son', 'daughter', 'year', 'environment', 'great', 'preschool', 'ms', 'experience']",Ace @ Work Childcare Pte Ltd (703 Choa Chu Kang St 53)
"My kids come here not knowing any English I've made a lot of progress since I came here. I couldn’t do math before. I finished the math problem in 5 minutes after I got here. I didn’t like going to school before I like school very much now The school also has many different activities Let children learn through play Such a relaxed and happy mind will learn faster I can't write rigidly. There are also teachers who often take photos of children studying in school and give them to parents. There will be a school magazine every month Witness your children’s growth together The school also organizes outdoor activities Parents can participate together We can observe children interacting and communicating with classmates and teachers Coming to ace work is a happy time for children to grow up.

"""My girl has been there since 2.5 years. Really appreciate the teachers effort in making it a fun and enjoyable place for both the kids and parents. The teachers organize events to involve parents too such as mother's day lunch and father's day Spartan race. My girl really love the school. Really gratedul for mdm Dina, the principal for letting us have a year of fun with the team. Shout-out to teacher Tia, 週老師, teacher farhana, teacher verda and teacher hana for taking care of my girl from n1 to mid of n2. While we have shifted away from jurong, my girl still misses this place and ask us to visit the teachers whenever possible. This shows how much of an impact the teacher has on the kids.

"I would like to thank all the teachers and staffs Ace at Work Jurong East, especially Ms. Dina, Teacher Charmaine, Teacher Donna and Liuna Laoshi, for their guidance and support. My child stayed with them for 4 years and I am very secured on how they took care and taught my child. The environment inside is the cleanest childcare I have ever visited. And the teachers and children in this childcare are very kind. The apps used for communication between families and educators is also very convenient for parents to know their children’s daily situation at any time. Teachers and the principal will also communicate with each parent in a timely and patient manner. Also, the distribution ratio between children and teachers is appropriate. Almost every child receives timely care and attention. They have lots of activities to enhance the children’s talents and skills (arts, music, sports, etc). Thank you for the 4 wonderful years at Ace at Work and for being a great support to all the parents.

"My girl has just started her first 2 weeks in this school and our experience has been nothing short of amazing. From the first call with the Principal Mdm Dina till the hug from the Teachers today, I can feel their passion, love and care for the students. My girl just turned 2 not long and is at a stage where she is more aware of the environments and also have a mind of her own. She started off isolating herself, refusing to join in the class activities and just watching from far till now enjoying the companion of the students and teachers! I think most credits go to the teachers for making my girl feel safe, loved and comforted. The Teachers also constantly send us photos of our girl and keep us updated of the progress, and attentive to our needs and questions raised. I hope my girl will love school one day and I believe this day is coming soon 👍🏼 Many thanks to the amazing team of teachers and of course Mdm Dina",0.38000000000000006,Topic 5,"['teacher', 'school', 'child', 'kid', 'care', 'good', 'love', 'thank', 'parent', 'principal', 'staff', 'learn', 'son', 'daughter', 'year', 'environment', 'great', 'preschool', 'ms', 'experience']",Ace @ Work Childcare (JE288B)

"""Contrary to other opinions, I find this school exceptional. Choosing a preschool for your child is a significant decision for parents, and I'm delighted with my selection. My daughter has grown academically and behaviorally, learning things I couldn't have taught her elsewhere. This is largely due to the excellent teacher-to-student ratio, ensuring she receives ample personal attention. I feel reassured knowing she's in capable hands.
