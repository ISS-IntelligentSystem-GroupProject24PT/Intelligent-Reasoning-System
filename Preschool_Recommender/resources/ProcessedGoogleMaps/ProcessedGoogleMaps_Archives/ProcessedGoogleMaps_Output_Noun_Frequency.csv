"We have had the pleasure of sending our child to MindChamps @ Brooks II since 1 year ago, and we couldn't be happier with the experience.  The teachers at MindChamps are exceptional. Their dedication, patience, and genuine care for each child create a nurturing environment where kids thrive. They not only educate but also foster emotional development and social skills in a way that goes above and beyond our expectations.  The curriculum is well-structured and engaging, tailored to meet the needs and interests of every child. We've been amazed at the progress our child has made, not just academically, but also in terms of creativity, independence, and confidence.  The facilities are clean, safe, and thoughtfully designed.  Communication with the staff is seamless. We've always felt welcome to ask questions, seek updates, or discuss any concerns we might have. The regular progress reports and parent-teacher meetings have been invaluable in understanding our child's development journey.  Special events and activities are frequent, and it's evident that the staff put a lot of effort into making each one memorable, be it birthday celebrations, themed dress-up days, field trips, or holiday celebrations. The school's management also went above and beyond to create a touching video montage for my child on his birthday. We're really thankful that our child loves school and has a great time at MindChamps., As a parent, I have carefully reviewed all the comments. I must objectively state that this school indeed has many issues, and I do not recommend parents to enroll their children here.  Firstly, there has been an excessively high turnover of teachers over the past two years. Except for a few senior staff members, the entire teaching staff leaves every year.  Secondly, due to the frequent turnover of teachers, children have a very hard time adapting to the school. This has led parents to lose confidence in the school.  In summary, this is not a trustworthy school, and in recent years, the school leadership has turned a blind eye to this. The teachers I have come into contact with who left were all highly professional and dedicated. I believe that if it weren't for the extremely poor working environment, no teacher would want to leave.  It is evident that the school leadership is not very friendly to its staff, which has resulted in poor school management., MindChamps PreSchool @ Brooks II has become my second home and I feel incredibly thankful to be a part of the team at this preschool. Our little ones are our top priority and we give our best every day to ensure they receive the love, attention, and education they deserve. It's truly fulfilling to see them blossom into confident and curious individuals., Teachers are incredibly caring and patience towards my son. My son enjoys going to sch and always happily mentioning about his teachers! Teachers often kept us updated as well! Kudos to Ms Poova, ÊûóËÄÅÂ∏à and Ms Priscilla!, The school's communications is so lousy. The teachers/admin always makes assumptions.  The teacher even told my daughter that she cannot go toilet. Saying ""sorry, too bad"". As they were late for some event. Don't expect the teachers to take complete care for your kid.  And the director is always missing when issues happens. BUT She will be always there take your registration fee for your kid.  The teachers keep changing too. Seriously. I don't know what is happening.  Register your kid at your own risk. You have been warned. Definitely complaining to HQ soon.  Updates: Seems the school director doesn't seems to care what has happened and mindchamp HQ is down playing the matter.  Lost of words...  Good luck to parents that still wish to still send their kids here., My daughter started attending her pre-school from PG till now N2. Teachers and stuffs have been guiding her well, and have always feedback to us about her behaviour and performance in school. Will definitely let my daughter stay till she finish her K2., The teachers are very caring for the kids and I can see my kids growing up and learning happily. Many events and celebrations are also held to make sure learning is a happy process for the kids. Thank you Mindchamps Brooks II for the pleasant experience!, My child has experienced five teacher changes within just eight months. It appears that the school's management team does not value their teachers, leading to a high turnover rate due to a poor working environment. Despite paying a significant amount in school fees, I feel disappointed with the quality of education and learning process that my child is receiving at this institution. Therefore, I strongly encourage parents to reconsider sending their children to this school., My son joined from PG and now N2 already. The teachers were very patient and nice to him. I'm so glad that he was taken care of and grow up happily., The boss/director of this preschool lacks effective management skills. There is a frequent turnover of teachers due to bad working conditions. I have concerns about the inadequate care my son receives. I am genuinely disappointed by this Mindchamps branch., Made a very good chance for sending my daughter to MindChamp right after she hit 18 months age. She gonna be promoted to K1 for 2024, and we are looking forward to her new journey with MindChamp., Management is now paying for bots to write good review? Look at all the 5 star reviews posted at the same time. Shady pre-school. Think twice before sending your precious child to this pre-school. Good teachers have all left., Joined MindChamps@BrooksII in 2019 and can't believe we are planning our 4th K2 graduation.     Consider myself blessed to be part of the team that weathered COVID together. Now, we have a new team but the outlook is optimistic because we put our Champs first in all things., The teachers go above and beyond to ensure that every child feels safe, valued, and engaged. It's evident that they genuinely care about each child's development and well-being., Darlene has just joined N2 Brooks this year. I was concerned if she would adapt well as her previous preschool was less academic and focused on playing. Growing up in an academic focused environment, I knew the importance of giving our children a head start in the right preschool and I am pleased to say that Darlene has improved tremendously in her writing, speech and (even) eating ability! I know she‚Äôs on good trajectory and will be ready for primary school by the time she graduates! Looking forward to send her younger siblings there too., My elder daughter had been in Mindchamps since July in K1, and she had been enjoying and looking forward to going school.  Despite this short few months that she just started, she had improved academically and become more independent. The teachers and staff are very helpful and keep us updated about her progress etc especially Ms Han. We had also enrolled our youngest for 2021 N1 and totally have no qualms having our two girls under the care and teaching by Mindchamps. Thank you, MindChamps., Must say, it was such a relief when my 3yo adapted into the school easily - just a month ago. I was filled with anxieties during my son's first few days in N1 - however was eased by the school teachers and the management. They sent me photos and updated on how my son was settling down. Phew! Such an ease. A fantastic team; great teachers and staffs. This is definitely a great placement. It's through my son's expressions that I see how much he loves to be at school. He is HAPPY child. After school he sings and shares some stories here and there. Thank you Mindchamps üòä, We are so thankful for Ms Linna and her faculty of amazing educators at Mindchamps @The Brooks for everything they do on a daily basis for our children. They are always warm and full of love, and it‚Äôs always assuring to know that our children are in good hands when in school because the Teachers keep in close contact with us and respond quickly to any concerns we may have. The centre is also big on being GREEN and eco friendly so you will see really creative displays done up by the Teachers using recycled materials in school. This is wonderful as it teaches our young ones not only about saving Gaia but also how we can be less wasteful and more creative! Truly an amazing team and we have nothing but great things to say about them. Can‚Äôt wait to start our younger one in PG next year!, A bright, well decorated centre, feels safe for young children. I will surely recommend to my family and friends, Dearest MC @ Brooks II staff,  A rose for everyone to start school! It has been a trying period and thank you for persevering!  Thank you especially to the teachers who had to bring their lessons online overnight as well as be there for limited services.  Thank you cleanliness captains for working extra hard to keep the school clean.  Thank you chef for looking after the children's diet.  Thank you all backend staff for coordinating and doing all the admin work.  Thank you everyone in MC Brooks II!  Love, Mr and Mrs Zhang, PG Teachers are caring and responsive. They are attentive to things that may seem insignificant yet important to us eg. my son's constipation. Teacher monitors the situation n mindfully gives the supplement. I like the padded gym where my son can jump and run without fear of being injured., Dedicated staff, clean and bright environment, a conducive school for young children., Good experience. Dedicated teachers and management team. My child enjoys going to school., Good study environment, highly recommended!",0.23031258447434932,3,"['school', 'teacher', 'child', 'mindchamps', 'staff', 'good', 'thank', 'son', 'kid', 'care', 'brooks', 'team', 'send', 'management', 'year', 'environment', 'young', 'go', 'parent', 'ii']",MindChamps PreSchool @ The Brooks II
"The signature show for the K2 graduation was truly impressive. It was evident how much passion and effort the teachers invested in the preparation of the show. I am deeply grateful for their dedication in nurturing our child with a champion mindset. Thank you so much!, Thank you for putting the curriculum showcase in such a short span of time. It exuded confidence from our little champs and showcased their amazing handicrafts.  I was able to see my toddler in a different light, thanks to your dedicated efforts.  Looking forward to future events! Good job planning committee üëç, Highly recommended to all. Kudos to their kind teachers, very engaging towards kids and parents. Kids learn new things every single day. The environment is very comfortable for kids and stress free for parent when you are out to work. üòçüòçüòç, Celebrated Cereal Day in school. Very well executed and had a great time with my son. The school is well run and the teachers are caring and attentive., Very creative and engaging session on the curriculum show case day., My boy experiences a very interactive and interesting learning experience. As a parent , we also have a nice experience with sport day event n show&tell event. Good job to the whole of teaching teams üëè. ‚Ä¶, All of the champs has done a great job. Awesome!! I can see all champs had fun, enjoy & build up their confident level. Good job Teachers!, I love the experience I've had with Mindchamps @ Woodlands. We've been with the school for about a year plus and I feel that the teachers and staff have been really thoughtful and loving towards my child. There's no issue with sending him to school and he adapted to the environment really quick. It speaks volumes about their level of care because my baby usually cries a lot with strangers when he was younger.  The teachers would also communicate closely with us parents to explore ways in which we can better my child's development and I am glad to know that the teachers do understand my child's temperament, development and habits really well. Thus, this has been reassuring to know that my child is in good hands of professionals who are experienced with dealing children as unique individuals.  I also love that the school's academic approach is dynamic, where teachings aren't confined to the classroom. I love how my child is able to communicate what he learned in school to me when I come home from work. More importantly, I do appreciate the occasional drops of photos through the Mindchamps app like the attached photos, where I get exclusive updates of their time in school.  I cannot thank the teachers enough for providing a loving and nurturing environment for the children. (:  extending my most heartfelt thanks, mother of Henry., Before choosing MindChamps, I visited other schools for comparison. Ultimately, I chose MindChamps Woodlands for several main reasons:  1:The school's core value is respecting children with zero intimidation. as a mother, this was my top priority. 2:The educational philosophy of the school's 10 core values attracted me. 3:MindChamps Woodlands is directly affiliated with the MindChamps headquarters. 4:The school environment is great, very comfortable, and clean. 5:The transparent curriculum planning and the careful selection of food for children made me feel more assured. Without hesitation, I chose MindChamps Woodlands. after my child started at this kindergarten, I felt reassured (i still rmb i was crying together with my son in the first few days to school.). The school's app updates on child's situations time to time daily. Most importantly, my child enjoys going to school. despite relocating (the new home being about an hour's drive from MindChamps Woodlands), we visited new MindChamps schools with the intent to transfer. However, my child firmly insists on staying at MindChamps Woodlands with their teachers and classmates. i always believe that the child's heart is pure, and I believe their choice follows their innermost preference. although it's tough, both my hubby and I respect our child's choice. This little boy strives not to be late for school every day, waking up between 6:50-7:00 am consistently for over half a year.  Whenever I ask about his favorite teacher or subject, he always says, I love all the teachers, and I enjoy all the subjects.' But he especially loves the time spent in MindGym and MindSpace. Witnessing my child's joyful anticipation of going to school every day is the happiest moment when sending him to school. Many friends send their children for English tuition, but I feel at MindChamps, I witnessed my child's gradual transformation, not aiming for the best, but improving every day,day by day,bit by bit. This is what I have seen and been most moved by in my child. The MRW and ReadAlong app at MindChamps make it unnecessary for us, a non-English-speaking family, to provide additional tutoring. Of course, this varies from person to person. However, at this stage, I've seen this in my child, and we allow him to progress at his own pace.  Over the years, MindChamps Woodlands and all the teachers have given my child warmth, care, and guidance, nurturing him bit by bit from a small boy into a confident, warm, and sunny big boy. He is graduating K2 this year. Initially, to provide 100% companionship in a warm growing environment for my child, I chose to leave the workforce. Children has to grow in each stage, and as a mother, I believe the nurturing environment and people around them, be it at home or school, are most important. At this moment, I am proud to say my best decision was choosing MindChamps Woodlands.and in primary school, Mindchamps mindspace 's art of learning and continued education on ten value attracted me again. we also signed up for mindspace without hesitation as after school student care center for my child .i believe it will be my another best decision.  Sincerely thanks all the teachers for everything ‚ù§Ô∏è. Your presence makes parents like me feel more secure. And it's because of your silent dedication and guidance that I am even prouder of everything my child has achieved., Teachers are attentive and could see they put a lot of effort in nurturing the students creativity/skills and the effort can be see in all the nice artworks from the students. Keep up the good work teachers!, Great efforts and nice performance done by teachers and students! This showcase will allow us parents to know what are learned for the year. This performance also build confidence in students!, Sent my son here from 18 months till 4! And safe to say, I am glad mindchamps has seen his progress throughout his baby years - from being a scared baby to a more confident 4 year old who is able to articulate his thoughts well:) thank you Teachers and MC Woodlands., Happy parent of a 4th year student at Mindchamps. Excellent learning, interactive classes, professional teachers and wonderful growth in children. Would highly recommend., Love the teachers and school. My child are having a great time in school!, Champs are very good. Excellent work, Hanyu Pinyin Workshop is worth attending as teachers shared on how to teach our kids in learning Hanyu Pinyin in a fun way., Top Brand winner in Preschool Education consistently for 5 Years. Unique SMILES curriculum focusing on Sensory Motor Intellectual Linguistic Emotional and Social skills.

My daughter absolutely enjoyed school everyday, Highly recommended. The teachers are kind, engaging, and patient with kids. Most importantly, they make them feel happy and welcome. The environment is great for kids, take a tour and see for yourself!, My child has been attending MindChamps @ Woodlands since he was 2 years old. Being a reserved child, he was having difficulties expressing himself openly to the teachers. Despite so, the teachers are wonderfully patient and encouraging. 2 years in, he has finally opened up more and express his needs in school. We are ever so delighted to hear about his day and could clearly tell he enjoys school a lot!  We know our child learns best through the play-based learning and is glad that the teaching methods  are align with the needs for our child.  The cleanliness and hygiene practices of the school are also commendable. It gives us more peace of mind that our child is in good hands.  Thank you to all the wonderful teachers in MindChamps Woodlands!  Max's mummy, is a great programme, both parent and champ to join together to play a games and cooking activity., Great effort and talents from teachers! Teachers here are mindful of every individual kids! All the way teachers and champsüòäüíï ‚Ä¶, Honestly a very commendable and highly impressive team of educators and support staff. Too many adjectives i could described this impressive team but it will still be insufficient for just an amazing group of people here.  My little one has grown in confidence and the difference is startling and stark compared to his previous childcare. If you are looking for a childcare that sees and treats your child qs an individual and a person then this is the best childcare you can provide for your child. I am so glad the entire staff doesn't treat my little one as a KPI.  The excellence starts from the top which is the Principal and it just flows naturally to her team and staff from the teachers and admins.  A big shout out and kudos to all the teachers and staff here who have made my little one learning journey a brilliant.  Due to relocation, we have to transfer our little one to another mindchamps but if circumstances were different I would be confident to just continue with mindchamps woodlands., Impressive: when we always wonder what is being taught or learned by kids, when we stepped into the learning environment and watch the kids perform, speak, sing & dance was amazing: thank you champs, teachers and principal, Overwhelmed by the amazing performance on the curriculum showcase day and all the effort and hardship behind this from all the champs and staffs! Thank you for hosting us!, Fun learning environment! Teachers are devoted and dedicated to educate the next gen of leaders and champs., Pleasant learning environment and teachers are all awesome!

Worth every penny, Love the professionalism of the team. Teachers are very professional and friendly.

We are satisfied with the school's overall focus on curriculum and mindsets training.

He especially love the music lessons., Truly a great place to nurture and groom the younglings. Friendly staff and timely updates on the kid's learning progress and comprehensive reports. Lesson plans are well thought of, and can you imagine a school with indoor playground + weekly cooking classes. Highly recommended., All the champs have put up a lot of  effort on such wonderful performance. Thank you., Excellent school and great teachers. My kids love going to school and have learnt alot., Great effort from the teachers & champs to come up with this curriculum engagement., My daughter has been with MindChamps Preschool Woodlands for 4 years now. Through the well designed learning programmed and enrichment classes, not only she has learnt so much but also grew to be more confident. The school has become our extended family with great shared memories., When we first visited MindChamps Preschool, my son was in awe of the aquarium at the reception area. From then, he became more excited to come to school. We would like to commend his teachers who have sparked our son's interest in numbers and art and taught him to be more independent. They also give us updates of his performance that make me and my partner more excited. Thank you for getting us involved in our child's preschool Journey!, Our daughter has been studying at MindChamps@Woodlands for almost 4.5 years. She enjoys going to school everyday. We are very pleased with the school teachers, facilities and programs.  Teachers at MindChamps are professional, caring and dedicated. We appreciate the constant communication with the teachers through app messages, face-to-face meetings, weekly and monthly reports. Up-to-date trainings for the teachers ensure the quality of teaching and learning provided to the students.  The classrooms are inviting and conducive for learning. Our daughter enjoys playtime at MindGym and MindScape. The MindScape is a new playground facility that is only available at Woodlands and Toa Payoh branches.  The program at MindChamps has allowed my child to build a strong foundation. She is able to vocalise her thoughts and express herself well. Lessons such as the show-and-tell sessions, Creativity and Theatrical Strategies have allowed her to build up her confidence and presentation skills. The Reading and Writing lessons enable her to read and write independently from a young age. She also enjoys her MindChamps Music lessons where she has learnt to play the recorder, violin, keyboard and other musical instruments. During Gourmet Moments, she has learnt about food preparation, nutrition, and different cuisines, and is proud to bring home the dish she has prepared in school.  My child has also been instilled moral values such as empathy, kindness and courtesy, and is able to care for others. We are heartened with her growth and development over the past four years and are confident that she will be well-prepared for primary school., My daughter has been with Mindchamps for about a year. The teachers had been really thoughtful and kind towards her! They got her to adapt really quickly to school and there was constant communication with the parents on the progress of my girl. Kudos to the team at Mindchamps Preschool Woodlands!!, After being overseas for the bulk of my child's pre-school years, my husband and I were in search of a pre-school that can continue to develop his social & emotional abilities, and work on his academic skills. We were impressed with the quality of works the Mindchamps' children produced during the centre visit.  In just a couple of months with Mindchamps, he has gained knowledge of  topics he was recently exposed to and has improved tremendously in his languages. The educators put in a lot of efforts in providing a well-rounded experience to develop the children holistically - from introducing the various attractions in Singapore through roleplaying, to learning musical instruments and inculcating good values.  He's always eager to share about his day in school, things he learnt and social interactions with his classmates and we believe that's a good sign that he's thoroughly enjoying his time there!, Sports day was a great initiative. Let‚Äôs have more parent-child activities!, My daughter has been with Mindchamps@Woodlands11 for almost half a year, although her attendance has been affected by COVID a little bit, but still can see her big progress in term of her english speaking, vocabulary, most importantly the confidence of communicating in english. i think we have made a right choice for her to well adapt into english speaking environment as well as keeping up with Chinese learning., The teachers are passionate in teaching, creating a positive and nurturing environment.

It is very gratifying to see the hard work of the children and teachers. Thank you to the teachers for their careful teaching, so that the children can be happy, grow and learn happily., A happy day, the activities are very attractive, The children are very happy here",0.3721011557698548,5,"['school', 'teacher', 'child', 'mindchamps', 'learn', 'woodlands', 'good', 'day', 'year', 'great', 'thank', 'champ', 'love', 'kid', 'enjoy', 'environment', 'student', 'parent', 'effort', 'time']",MindChamps PreSchool @ Woodlands
"It‚Äôs been such a wonderful experience for my son and both my husband and I.  Though my son was enrolled less than 6 months in his last year of preschool before the start of primary 1 in the following year, we‚Äôve seen so much progress in him academically as compared to the 2 years he was in another preschool.  The Principal, teachers and staff have been so helpful and accommodating to my son. They‚Äôve been so kind and warm towards my son that both my husband and I felt so touched, grateful and appreciative for all that they‚Äôve done. You truly feel the love and sincerity that they have towards the kids there.  This preschool is really exceptional, not only have they been so accommodating, they‚Äôve also gone above and beyond to help my boy in his progress not only academically, but also intellectually. He‚Äôs grown to be more confident and has an undaunted attitude towards the start of primary 1.  My son was so excited about going to his new primary 1 school. And it‚Äôs all thanks to the teachers and principal at his preschool who have prepared him well.  My husband and I both appreciate the culture at mindchamps and how they groom our children to be confident individuals and undaunted when faced with challenges.  Thanks once again to all the teachers and principal of this preschool for going above and beyond to help my son not just in preschool but also for the start of his primary 1 adventure. For us as parents, that‚Äôs the most  comforting support., Mindchamps performing arts preschool @Upper Thomson Road was a great preschool choice for our daughter. She learned always so much and was happy to go to school. The kids and teachers were always welcoming her so nicely that until now this nice feeling has not yet been replaced. Thank you teachers and kids for leaving a nice memory in our daughter‚Äôs head ‚ò∫Ô∏è. I will definitely recommend this school to anyone as it‚Äôs a great school., Despite our daughter being a transfer student in N1, the transition was beyond expectations. It was the best decision we ever made to enroll our daughter into Mindchamps Performing Arts Preschool (Tagore Lane). We can tell she is truly happy in school. The school has a Vibrant & Warmth presence. The teachers and team really has made her feel seen and cared for. Their genuine care and concern for our daughter well-being have touched our heart. She has also blossomed in speech, reading & arts! We were surprised she enjoys school so much!  Thank you to the Teachers and team of Mindchamps Performing Arts(Tagore Lane) for keeping the school clean, strict on their hygiene in which we can send our daughter to school at ease & making every day in your respective classroom a memorable experience & providing a nurturing space where our daughter and the kids can flourish academically, socially, and emotionally. The Teachers and Team are remarkable educators and mentors!, My daughter moved from a previous school, N1. In the past 8+ months everyday of school for her have been an absolute joy. She looks forward to going to school, and will even express her unhappiness when we are running late. In the relatively short time span, she have blossomed , with her speech and social skills developing really fast. She will also practise new songs and dances she learnt in school. Grateful to Mindchamps, providing my girl, a warm ,nurturing environment and most importantly, an amazing childhood., My daughter has been a N2 student at MindChamp Preschool since Jan 2023. She finds great joy in her educational experience and adapt quickly into the school environment. Her time at school is consistently marked with happiness and laughter, clearly witnessed when I pick her up from school and her sharing in the evening. I wish to express my appreciation to the dedicated teachers for their hard work and commitment for the past months., My two kids had been study in Mindchamp Preschool and they really enjoyed their school days there. The teachers are great, caring and patient. I can really see my kids improved a lot  from the school learning., MindChamps@Upper Thomson is not a very big school, but full of love. All the teachers are friendly and responsibility. My kid already studied here 1 year and improved in all aspects. He enjoyed his school time so much, I highly recommend., Our son attended PG since Jan 23 and he loves to go to school daily. He is able to speak well and share with us what he did in sch daily. All the teachers are kind and able to remembers their name/character etc. They also organise mthly excursion to parks/esplanade, family day, Chinese appreciation day, year end concert etc., I cannot recommend Mindchamps @Upper Thomson enough for parents looking for a more engaging and nurturing environment for their little ones. My daughter enrolled there when she was 18 months old. She was very shy, so teachers must have made a tremendous effort to make my daughter feel safe and secure there very quickly. My daughter has developed many skills and learned so much during her time at school, from eating and sleeping on her own, socializing with her peers, to learning her colors, shapes, and numbers etc in both English and Chinese.  The music, dance, and drama lessons at this preschool offer a great introduction for us to discover our daughter's interests and talents. Mr Alim, Ms Misellya and Mr Nas did an amazing job to make these lessons so enjoyable. The school also offers weekly reading program and monthly outing program, which we find very enriching and interesting. What sets this preschool apart, though, is the staff's dedication to each child's individual needs and personalities. The PG class size is so small (teacher to student ratio is 2:6) that teachers take the time to get to know each child and tailor their care and education accordingly. My daughter adores her class teachers- Ms Nor & Lin Laoshi, who are both very passionate and responsive and understand my daughter's needs perfectly. They communicate with us on a daily basis, providing updates and feedback that give us peace of mind and help us support our daughter's development at home.  Overall, we are grateful to have found this school and its wonderful team. We feel confident and comfortable leaving our daughter in their care, and she loves going to school every day., Our daughter has been in MindChamps for 8 months (since 18 months old). In these 8 months that have absolutely flown by, we have seen dramatic all-round development in her. Being an only child and grandchild, she has learnt to interact and share with children of her age, and from what we hear from her teachers, display some early leadership skills as well. She particularly enjoys dance and music classes in school, and she looks forward excitedly whenever she has to wear her dance outfit to school. She recently went for her first ever school excursion and had many fond memories of it to share with the family when she came home. It is clear to us that she looks up to and adores her teachers, and enjoys her time in school, as she always smiles when we talk about her teachers and is always pretending to be the teacher at home to her cuddly toys. Kudos to all the teachers in Mindchamps for providing a loving and nurturing environment for our daughter to learn in!, Nurturing teachers who provide a safe and learning environment for my child. The school brings them on interesting excursions frequently as well. My child enjoys going to school., We always thought that all pre-schools are the same i.e., how different can it be when all we need is a daycare center where children just eat, sleep, and play? We later realised it wasn't quite the case!  As we moved house, we transferred our almost 3-yo toddler from her previous preschool to MindChamps Upper Thomson. With a smaller and intimate class setting, she took just a couple days to settle-in and after 6 months being here, she wakes up looking forward to go to school every morning ‚Äì sometimes asking for school during the weekend!  We observed that the MindChamps curriculum is comprehensive, and our LO has developed a lot since ‚Äì she speaks a lot more at home and gets more and more articulate by the day ‚Äì in both English and Chinese. She also particularly enjoys the music, dance, and drama classes, which we are also kept very informed by the frequent newsletters and updates from the teachers. With the weekly reading activities encouraged by the school in partnership with the parents at home, our LO has also cultivated the habit of reading (accompanied) and her love for books.  The smaller class size and undivided attention worked well for our LO who thrives in a more intimate environment. More importantly, the teachers are also very professional, friendly, and patient üòä Special shout-out to her favorite teachers ‚Äì Zhao Laoshi, Ms Jane, Mr Alim, Mr Naz and Misellya,¬†kudos!, I highly recommend MindChamps Upper Thomson to all parents. My daughter who has started school since the start of the year, has progressed so much in all aspects- social, emotional, fine and gross motor skills as well as literacy skills too. The teachers are friendly, nurturing, patient and they keep parents up to date about anything regarding their child. The curriculum is good and my kid has benefitted greatly. I am happy as a parent to send my kid to school everyday as she also looks forward to going too., Ms Joy and Deng Laoshi are very patient and put lots of time and effort to help my kid to improve in eating and learning since we joined the school. My kid has significant improvement in English, Chinese and eating habits. Ms Joy and Deng Laoshi always encourage my kid and provide patient guidance in school. They also communicate promptly with us to share all the happenings in school about my kid. We greatly appreciate both Ms Joy and Deng Laoshi on the effort and love that they have put in culturing our kid. Last but not least, our kid also enjoyed Ms Dorothy‚Äôs reading&writing classes, Ms Lya‚Äôs dance classes and Mr Alim‚Äôs music classes!, Ever since the performing arts curriculum was put in place, i could see my child becoming more confident, and she enjoys going to school everyday. She would also come home and share with us what she has learnt in class. Thanks to all the teachers for their patience and guidance, she has definitely blossomed!, MindChamps Upper Thomson is such a vibrant and happy place. It is an awesome environment for both learning and character development. Our kids come home singing new songs and excitedly sharing the things they learnt. Their affection for the school is clearly evident from how they proudly say ‚ÄúThis is my MindChamps!‚Äù every time they pass by the school on weekends. As a parent, I deeply appreciate the school‚Äôs effort to organise activities for the children beyond the curriculum, such as field trips and concerts. I also know that I can count on the teachers to give me feedback and tackle any issues together. Never been this thankful. :), MindChamps has developed my children‚Äôs language skills in English and Mandarin They also inculcates good values and sense of hard work. Indeed, MindChamps did a great job in preparing them for primary school., Great school and my son loves the environment!, It only took 5 days for my 20-month-old child to go to Mindchamps from being nervous and timid at the beginning to now going to school happily every morning. In the first two days of school, I stayed with him for two mornings to help my child adapt. When the child cries, the teacher can hold the child in one hand during class. The classmates are also very happy to help the new friends. I feel the enthusiasm and warmth of the teacher and classmates. The school's curriculum is also very good. Food education and morality Intellectual, physical, art and labor are combined. Children also like music classes and dance classes very much. Every teacher is very kind and loving. It is a trustworthy kindergartenüëç",0.30028453364817004,2,"['school', 'teacher', 'daughter', 'child', 'kid', 'mindchamps', 'preschool', 'class', 'learn', 'go', 'enjoy', 'month', 'day', 'time', 'ms', 'son', 'environment', 'dance', 'love', 'great']",MindChamps Performing Arts PreSchool @ Upper Thomson Road
"We never regretted to send our kids to this PreSchool since 2021. Every staff in this center is dedicated and passionate about their job. We can see all of them love the students at all times. Also additional effort made by the teachers to constantly update the parents about the progress are much appreciated. Well done Mindchamps PreSchool Nordcom II...!, We never regretted sending our daughter here. The environment and all the teachers here are full of love. Ms Nicol is always very responsive and helpful. Their class teachers are very patient as my daughter started with zero English listening and speaking. Now she is able to communicate smoothly in English. They also offered special caring to her as she was very timid before she started school and she is much more outgoing now. We certainly love this PreSchool!, We are grateful to all the teachers in MindChamps Nordcom II especially Ms Nicol, I remember she invited us during celebrations before my son officially joined the school, it helped to integrate him into the new school better. We appreciate the prompt actions when we have any queries. Thank you Ms Chris, Ms Naz, Ms Du, Ms Lili,  Ms Gao and many other teachers who had taught and guided my son these years. I remembered Ms Lili helped to coax him even though she was not in charge of his class. I thank Ms Gao for carrying him when he was under your charge. I appreciate the timely updates from Ms Naz & Ms Du about him. Thank you Ms Chris for sharing useful tips in his development. It's heartwarming to see the school functions like a family where everyone knows one another, my son knows all the teachers too even those who don't teach him.  MindChamps Nordcom II has great facilities that makes it a welcoming school, the newly integrated playground is a hit! Every week, he looks forward to Thursday for the play. We also love the effort put in by the teachers in decorating the classrooms as well as their craft work. He did ferris wheel, panda and dinosaurs which are big projects with the help of teachers.  Thank you!, My kids love the school! The facilities are great, and the owner is hands-on and attentive. The dedicated teachers and staffs create a wonderful environment for the kids. Highly recommended! :), Special mention to Ms Chris, È´òËÄÅÂ∏à and Ms Nicol! My daughter  has been attending Mindchamps since N2 and we absolutely love the school! We've been thrilled with our child's experience at Mindchamps ‚Äì the school fosters a love of learning in them. The school offers a variety of extracurricular activities including music, sports and  cooking class. These have allowed my child to explore their interests and develop new skills. We would definitely recommend Mindchamps to other parents looking for a great educational experience for their child., My husband and I didn't have a specific school in mind when we wanted to enrol our son into preschool. We checked out all schools nearby and decided to go with Mindchamps Nordcom because we were impressed with Miss Nicol who is the Centre Director when we visited the school. Indeed, the experience we have had so far with our son did not disappoint. Mindchamps curriculum is well established but that aside, credits to Miss Nicol for running the centre extremely well and holding high levels of operational standards. Special call out to the teachers too! Miss Alice, Mr Rino, Miss Valerie, Hua Hua laoshi, Huang laoshi, and Miss Lak, for their guidance and care to the champs!, Nicole is a great center PIC and educator. The teachers are responsible and kind. We have peace of mind knowing that our daughter is in good hands at school. Thank you Teacher Hao, Teacher Lili, Teacher Ally, Mr Rhino, and Everyone at MindChamps@Nordcom II !, Today was 1st visit to the school for my wife, daughter and me.  Really impressed with the management, especially the center director Nicol.  Sets a high bar for operational quality, hiring and site management.  Looking forward to great school days ahead for my daughter +  Update 1:  I came back to edit this comment because I was so impressed with the school's operations.  It shows on my daughter's development - her vocabulary has increased at least 2x (especially Mandarin) in the past 1 month., To Ms Nicol and all Mindchamps @Nordcom II teachers,  Thank you for all the love, care, and dedication that you put into teaching Nathan Cai. We are beyond grateful for your guidance and support. Specially thanks to Ms Chris & È´òËÄÅÂ∏à for being an amazing teacher to Nathan and his classmates. ‚ù§Ô∏è üíú üß°üíöüíõüíô, Penning this together with hubby Kelvin Ong. Our daughter Hillary has grown and developed so much and so quickly since she was onboarded to N1C in Jan 2022 and has been a beneficiary of the kind and patient guidance of lead teachers (Ms Ally and Hao Laoshi) as well as other teachers / staff at Mindchamps @ Nordcom II. Being cooped largely at home due to Covid before joining a pre-school, Hillary was slower than her peers in expressing herself with words. With much learning and exposure to the nurturing environment and teachers at MC, she can now just yak on and on, albeit mostly in English. But she has to now work really hard on her Mandarin though to communicate better with her grandma and friends who use mainly Mandarin., Mindchamps @ Nordcom exceeds our expectations in many ways. Teachers are highly qualified, dedicated, caring and best of all, they work in close partnership & communication with Parents.  This preschool is a dream come true for Parents like me. ‚ÄãThey have one of the best, if not the best team of Teachers who are talented in their own ways (musically, intellectually, artistically etc.) & the Champs curriculum is enriching and fun. Centre Director, Ms Nicol can be seen on the ground supporting her team of Teachers always, it is very assuring to know what the centre is run with much love & attention.  My 3 kids loves going to school and that‚Äôs most important to me., My elder daughter joined in 2019 N2 level when the school just started operating. She felt at home instantly from the first day. In her 3yrs with Mc Nordcom2, I have never heard from her that she does not want to go to school in the morning. It says a lot about the overall vibe and cheerful environment that is truly unique to this school. She graduated in 2021 and moved on to primary school and I must say that mindchamp nc2 teachers prep their graduates very well for transitioning to primary school (spelling, show n tell, numerical etc). She was awarded all-rounder award at the end of her p1 academic year.  My younger boy joined in 2021 PG. I must thank the school and teacher for helping him transition from home to PG smoothly. He took around 2 weeks to get used to morning routine of going to school. Beyond that on most days, he does not struggle going to school. We saw him grew tremendously in term of language skill, motor skill, social skill, music skill etc. We were so thankful that it was his teacher who potty trained him successfully while we as parent were struggling to train him at home. From the very start he joined, the school teachers has kept very open and transparent communications in partnering with us as parents handling the various request and feedback. This is made possible thanks to the support of the school management championed by the centre director, who also happen to be the owner Ms Nicol.  Would also like to point out usually if I have any issues or questions to ask, teachers / center director would reply in timely manner. At times, if need to, they would deep dive into the issue for the answer and solution.  Hygiene : 5/5 Food: 4/5 Comm with parents: 5/5 Center Facilities: 5/5, We were previously from Mindchamps Nordcom but had to move to another Mindchamps centre. It was unfortunate because we can feel a difference between Mindchamps at Nordcom compared to others. At Nordcom, the teachers and Ms Nicol adds that extra touch of love and warm. Our child misses Nordcom and will always mention his old classmates from Nordcom. All the best Ms Nicol. Even till today, they still meet up for birthday parties., Principle & Teachers are equally competent. Environment of the school is very welcoming which makes my daughter love her class so much!, My son is very happy to go to school everyday.  He likes all the teachers and staffs. He enjoys all the activities as well! Thank you!, Our daughter joined MindChamps N2 class at age three. she used to be a shy girl with little confidence to talk or share in public. We are impressed by her changes, including both characters and capabilities.  We are grateful for teachers‚Äô patience and guidance to her(especially Ms. Aztina & Âê¥ËÄÅÂ∏à), which make her become a confident girl who believe in herself and always say ‚ÄúI am the best!‚Äù.  In general, we are satisfied with the school‚Äôs overall focus on curriculum and mindsets training. And hope she would achieve more in the coming year.  Great thanks, Olivia, No regrets sending my boy here. Very engaging methodologies are applied which ensure kids learn and retain knowledge effectively. Ms Chris and Gao Laoshi have taken very good care of my boy. Thanks to Ms Nicol for excellent management of the center!, As a first time parent sending our child to a preschool, we had of course, all the worries ahead of us such as if our child can get used to the environment and his teachers. Though the beginning was quite a challenge for us at drop offs, we were assured by Nicol and her team of teachers with occasional photo updates of our son in school via text messages.  Foremost, we are truly grateful for all the teachers in the campus, their dedication and patience (especially) is truly admirable. On some days when my son whines at drop offs, any teachers who came across me would gladly receive my son over, and it seems that my child knows every of the teachers in the centre and willingly allow them to carry over albeit emotional. The focus in ensuring every child enters the school on a positive morning is visibly rendered on a professional level, proven with the team work that came along with this observation.  We are truly thankful to Ms Cyn, Chen Lao shi and Wang lao shi for being the primary influence of our son‚Äôs inaugural school experience. It is indeed a job beyond the word ‚Äúdifficult‚Äù and we deeply appreciate their care towards our child while he is left in the centre under their care. Thumbs up to Nicol and your team of awesome teachers!, My younger daughter - Chloe Long joined K1 mindchamp Norcom early this year . We are very impressed with how she grows and learn during her tenure in K1 ; she demonstrates the ability of  understanding the concepts on her own way with the directive she learned from her teachers. I can honestly said that the way teacher nurtures the champs play an important part and leave a deep impact on their lil mind. She always impressed us through her conversations and action on her daily activities. In short, Chloe is so proud to be part of MindChamp family with the dedicated teachers and excellent environment., BIG Thank You!!!‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è to all the Teachers & Staff of MindChamps PreSchool @ Nordcom IIüëèüëèüëè We have seen a dramatic progress in our little champ N2 journey!

Special mention to Ms Aztina, Ms Wu Hong and Ms Nicol!!üëèüëèüëè - Proud Parents of Maria Aondreah Uchi Tating, I would like to says a Big Thank You to MindChamps Preschool @ Nordcom.

I look forward my child going to K1 next year. Well done and great effort throughout this year 2020. üëç üëçüëç, Excellent! Good environment! Teachers are very professional and friendly. The most important thing is kids really enjoy school time, and even want to go school on the weekend!!! it definitely will be a very happy learning journey for them., We really love the facilities. There‚Äôs an indoor drama/music centre, gym and recently an indoor playground. The school also get to use the basketball and pool facilities at the roof top. We love the great balance between academic and play at school., Love the professionalism of the team (especially Ms Nicol (principal), Ms Chris, Ms Gao, Ms Nira, Wang laoshi, Ms Supu), my girls enjoy going to school and I like that they focus on Chinese language, which is crucial for primary school preparation. Thank you MindChamps @ Nordcom II., I personally know the owners running this school.  They have a big heart and huge passion for young kids. That‚Äôs what every young parent need.

"Hands down the best place for my little one. Curriculum is robust, the extra curriculum activities are engaging to both parents and child too! Not forgetting the teachers and staffs there, they are amazing! You can tell when someone is passionate about their job, going above and beyond, giving their best for the little ones.  Mr Dave, Ms Isabelle, Ms Irish, ËÇñËÄÅÂ∏à, Ms Cynthia, Ms Rin, Ms Sippy and all teachers, thank you for being a part of my daughter's life. We thank you from the bottom of our hearts., Having gone through less than ideal experiences with previous childcare centres, we were stringent about finding the right one for Chloe. Thankfully, we gave MindChamps PreSchool @ Yio Chu Kang a chance ‚Äì and fast forward to today, we are glad to have made that decision.  It was a challenging time for Chloe, who at 4, had to adapt to a new sibling and a new school environment at the same time. We are grateful to have Ms. Michelle as her main teacher, who is very passionate, dedicated, attentive and most importantly, genuinely interested in the well-being of the children. She assured us that Chloe would develop well under her guidance and indeed she benefited from the excellent learning environment.  We are also grateful for ÂÆãËÄÅÂ∏à, who within a short span of time has helped Chloe to improve dramatically in Chinese, especially in terms of handwriting and her careful attention to the Chinese strokes (Á¨îÁîª). We are truly blessed to have another amazing teacher in this school.  Finally, it is great leadership that pushes exemplary qualities in the staff and teachers. For this, we have Mr. Dave to thank for he never fails to listen to our feedback and recommendations despite his busy schedule. His enthusiasm and passion towards preschool education can be seen in his ever-consistent search of an all-rounded education for the kids such as organising sports and activities to enrich the children‚Äôs experiences and physical and mental developments.  MindChamps PreSchool @ Yio Chu Kang has given us the confidence and assurance to enroll my younger daughter into PG class in the coming month. Keep up the amazing work!, This is a commendable preschool not only because of their well-planned curriculum, but also their child-friendly facilities. All of their play and learning room are safe and painted with fun colors which my daughter really likes. Teachers are also competent and passionate to little learners., They have a well balance of teaching of values and academics.

"Teachers changed very frequently. Some teachers are very rude to kids, for they scold kids very loudly. The most failure to attend this preschool was i believed they would teach the kids very well in English and Chinese, so stopped the tutor classes in other institutions. However, i found the kid's phonics and pinyin are so poor at last..., As parents, we do our best to nurture and be the strong foundation for our child, but with Teachers, they inspire hopes, imaginations and the love of learnings!  It takes a Big Heart to shape little Minds. Thank you  MindChamps for doing a great job!, Send your kids here. They get great education., Super friendly teachers!

"After four years at Mindchamps J10, my affection for this school has only grown stronger. I adore the close-knit community here..it feels like I‚Äôm reliving my own school days. From the sweetest teachers and principals to the wonderful parents, everyone is closely bonded.  Last month, our class organized a food donation drive, which deeply touched both me and my daughter. It was incredibly meaningful to be able to help needy families in our community. From packing to sorting to distributing, we all worked together seamlessly.  Studying here isn‚Äôt just about teachers and students..it feels like a second home. We‚Äôve never once regretted choosing Mindchamps J10., My son has been with MC10 since PG and he is K1 now. Super awesome and caring teachers and principal. Very appreciative of their dedication!  Thank you to the MCM (MindChamps Music) teachers for taking the initiative by organizing an introductory session of the violin for the parents too. It was useful to us so that we can guide our Champs appropriately when they practice at home., My son has been w MC J10 for a year now. MC has great and dedicated teachers who teaches the value of respect and makes a point in remembering every child's name. 2 thumbs up to Teacher Doreen, gls & wls.  We are very impressed. A very big thank you to the teachers & school for 101% effort, patience & hard work., We recently participated in the food donation drive event organized by MindChamps, and it was an incredibly rewarding experience for our family. Not only did we have the opportunity to contribute to a worthy cause, but we also witnessed firsthand the positive impact it had on our child.  Through this event, our child learned the importance of generosity, empathy, and community involvement. Seeing the joy on the faces of those who received our donations was truly heartwarming and left a lasting impression.  We are grateful for the dedication and hard work of our child's teachers, Ms. Lydia and Shu Ling Lao Shi, and the center Principle, Ms. Sharlene who instill these values on a daily basis.  Additionally, the support and involvement of the parent community around our child's class were instrumental in the success of the event.  Thank you to MindChamps J10 for organizing such a meaningful event, and to everyone involved for their dedication and support. We look forward to participating again in the future!, Super fun children‚Äôs day event. My kid is super enjoying the stay at MC JC10. Thank you all the teachers. Special shot out to Ms Eunice and Zhang Laoshi. üëç ‚Ä¶, Definitely 100% efforts from the teachers to make all the events fun and exciting for the champs! Love the vibes from the teachers!, Great school with very caring teachers and alot of effort in planning the excursions and special events, e.g. children day. Special shout out to Ms Doreen, Geng Lao shi, Ms Eunice and Zhang Lao shi. My children love the teachers very much üòç ‚Ä¶, We started our firstborn at Mindchamps J10 since Playgroup, and the curriculum has exposed her to opportunities for a holistic growth in the domains of language, cognitive development and socio-emotional skills. The school also provides a conducive environment for learning with its well thought-out and organized classrooms and facilities.  She returns home excitedly every day and shares with us the activities and experiences she has gone through in school. Not only has she formed strong friendships with her classmates (us parents have formed great friendships too!), but also developed good rapport with her supportive teachers and even non-teaching staff. Communication between parents and teachers has always been transparent and prompt with the Mindchamps app, as we are constantly updated with our child‚Äôs progress and well-being in school. Her increasing independence and curiosity stand as evidence of the effectiveness of Mindchamp‚Äôs pedagogical approach and the professionalism of J10‚Äôs teaching team.  Our secondborn started his school journey in July 2023. At just slightly over 6 months, we have noticed remarkable progress in his language, numeracy, and social interaction skills. With his new found friendships and deep bonds with the teachers, he is ecstatic to go to school every day and is loving and enjoying every moment in school.  Thank you Mindchamps J10, for helping the 2 Js grow, learn and most importantly, for making their early school years memorable and cherished!, My boy has been with Mindchamps @ J10 for the past 3-4 years (from PlayGroup till K1 currently), and we have witnessed how he has learned and grown throughout his time at Mindchamps. The teaching staff are very meticulous in their work, and would tirelessly plan extra activities outside of the usual curriculum to allow the champs to learn in an experiential manner in different environments outside of the classroom. Curriculum aside, when we observe the champs interact outside of the classroom environment, we could tell that the teachers have inculcated a certain level of decorum expected of the champs in social interaction, and this is testament to the culture of the school, which is greatly influenced by how the school is run., Our child has been with Mindchamps J10 since N1 and this has been the best decision we have made for him! He looks forward to school everyday which really makes us assured that he is well taken care of.  Their K1 class recently organised a project ‚ÄúGive a Hand, Give a Can‚Äù where they collaborated with Fei Yue Active Ageing Centre to collect, pack and distribute donated food items and necessities for family in needs. It was heartwarming to see all the teachers and parents come together to contribute for this meaningful event. Through this, the kids had the opportunity to become community helpers for a day and learn how their small little action can make a significant difference in the lives of others.  We highly recommend Mindchamps J10 to anyone looking for a childcare for their kids in this area! Thanks to all the wonderful teachers in doing such great jobs to care for our children!, My child has been with the school for the past 4 years. Teachers are all very caring and nurturing,  and always put in effort and support the child growth. More than happy to have my child enrolled here!, My daughter simply loves MindChamps! She is blessed to have met dedicated caring teachers who provided good care and guidance in her daily needs. A shout out to Ms Sharlene, Zhang Laoshi, Miss Jolynn, Miss Lim, Miss Esther and Miss Katy.  Our Champ comes home with stories of your kindness, creativity, and the exciting activities you have all planned. It‚Äôs clear that they have not only been her teacher but also a source of inspiration and comfort.  You‚Äôve helped her grow, learn, and most importantly, feel safe and cherished in your care. I truly appreciate her teachers for making her preschool experience memorable and for being a positive influence in her life. Your impact reaches far beyond the classroom.  Happy Children‚Äôs Day to the amazing Team of Teachers!, We went to 4 preschools school tour before deciding to enrolled our girl over to j10 Mindchamps.  What made us chose j10 MC : We love their new renovated playground, it is safe and sheltered. Kids can have water play, picnic and many fun activities there! As their playground is located out of the mall, We were worried that it might be too noisy.. so we went to check the traffic condition at several timing, and to our surprise, only peak hours about 5.30-6pm there was an increase of traffic.  We also like how they communicate effectively with parents in their own school app. I get to see updates like - what time my girl enters school, temperature checking and more.  So much thought and effort is put into the educational activities as well. I know my daughter loves being here, and i wouldn't take her anywhere else.  We‚Äôre so happy with our decision. This is her year 1 and I‚Äôm sure she will enjoy her 5 years here. ‚ù§Ô∏è, Amazing team of teachers, love their creativity in their planning for events and celebrations! So much fun for the children always! Thank you for the great effort put in, leaving precious memories for them!, We love the variety of enrichment activities. Our son enjoyed the music lessons. The exposure to different instruments is great, and helped him to discover his love for piano., Very nice teachers, my girl so lover her teachers., My elder daughter started with MC @J10 since it 1st opened up in 2015. In a flash of an eye, 6yrs had passed and now my younger daughter is going to spend her last year in MC in 2022.  I'm happy to see how my girls had developed overall throughout the years they had been in the centre (not just in studies, but even in the soft skills like leadership, adaptability, problem solving and social cohesiveness).  We had always found the teachers and directors at MC @J10 to be approachable and genuine in wanting to care for the children under them (maybe we were just blessed that my 2 girls had great teachers).  I had observed how improvements were made to the infrastructure over the years. I had seen the outdoor playground get refurbished into a garden area before a new playground was added as well. This makes water play so much more meaningful when we still remember how it originally was.  With the addition of the Allied care centre below, I have no doubt that the centre's management is looking towards providing awesome care for a larger spectrum of children (including those who might need additional assistance to integrate better into mainstream education). Kudos to their foresight and planning!  Here's to wishing MC @J10 and it's teaching staffs many more fantastic years ahead, creating better futures for our future generations!  Sincerely, Benjamin Celeste and Adele's Daddy, Fun and interactive activities done for Children's Day! My child has so much fun!, Thank you teachers (special shout-out to Ms Shakina, Yanfang Laoshi, Ms Esther, Ms Linda who have worked with us closely to ensure Thad adapted well to a whole new environment) for loving and nurturing our beloved child. What we find most amazing is the boy who used to cry at check-in every single day at his previous school, now wakes us up in the morning to send him to school asap so he can take part in all the activities/games/excursions that are planned. Thank you teachers and staff of Mindchamps J10!!, We started our son Isaac at Mindchamps J10 when he was 1.5 years old, just before the Covid pandemic started. He showed great affinity for the school as he was attentive and curious while we were taking a tour of the campus ‚Äì and since then he has embarked on a thrilling journey with the kindergarten. Mindchamps provides a conducive environment for Isaac to learn and grow over the years ‚Äì he picked up social skills quickly and displays proficiency in both Mandarin and English (yes he even challenges our vocabulary now!) and it is evident he has a great love for music and reading.  We especially appreciate the hard work put in by the teachers and staff at MindChamps J10 during the Covid period when classes were conducted online and regular updates were provided to parents through the Mindchamps app with lots of pictures and curriculum details.  And the teachers put in a lot of effort to give us a detailed write up of what Isaac learns every term, not just in English but also in Chinese. We are very glad that we can share photos of what Isaac does in school everyday with his grandparents as well!  Now Isaac looks forward to going to school every morning (Not just because of Fun Toast!) but he tells us that he looks forward to seeing his teachers and friends ‚Äì so much so he wants to stay back after school hours to continue playing with his classmates.  Thank you Mindchamps J10, for your love and dedication to Isaac! üòä, The school is located on the 2nd floor of the Junction 10 building. While I generally like the class schedule and the gym, I found the food being catered from elsewhere not so ideal. The fact the indoor gym is located next door means children have to put back their shoes to go to indoor gym classes, and take them off again. The outdoor playground is next to the junction, which is lots of traffic noises., Happy children's day! The champs had great fun today. Thanks to all teachers and staff who have put in so much effort to organise the games and performance., Excellent teacher crew with a caring principal. Student well being are well taken care of and parent could be at ease. Highly recommend: special shout out to n1 growth teacher , ms Doreen and Geng Lao Shi., Even though our son Aydan has only been with MindChamps for 8 months since he was 1.5 years old, witnessing his remarkable growth in every aspect truly affirms MindChamps as our preschool of choice. Aydan enjoys going to school and this speaks volume on the school‚Äôs holistic curriculum and the dedicated teachers & staff. Learning is fun and interactive through play, music, art, gourmet, etc.  The ease of communication with the teachers (with prompt replies) as well as regular updates/reports with pictures & videos via the MindChamps app is immensely useful and appreciated. The teachers and staff are always warm and friendly. As a parent, trust and assurance is crucial so that you can have a peace of mind, knowing your child is in good hands.  The regular events organised by the school such as festival celebrations, field trips, etc not only provides Aydan a different kind of learning experience and exposure, it also fosters bonding between us & Aydan and with the teachers.  We are sincerely grateful towards MindChamps and the J10 team for playing an important role in nurturing our next generation. The continued collaboration between us parents and MindChamps during Aydan's formative years will certainly stand him in good stead in future.  Thank you MindChamps J10!, Kyler followed his elder brother and joined Mindchamps @J10 since Playgroup and this shows how confident we are with the Mindchamps program and the school at Junction 10. As parents, we are grateful and appreciative of the school and teachers' effort to take in our feedback and work together.  Kyler used to have issues with pronunciation and was apprehensive of saying out new words. It was the school and teachers teamwork that helped nurture Kyler into a confident child. He is no longer afraid of pronouncing the word wrongly, and takes it as a challenge and enjoys the fun of learning. Since playgroup until K2, on a weekly basis, kyler has to bring back English and Chinese reading books provided by the school. And everyweek without fail, we would read with him. This has become a reading habit for kyler and us to read and bond together through the book section.  With the introduction of violin into the music program, Kyler discovered his passion for music and fun with violin. He loves it so much that he requested for us to engage a violin teacher for extra lessons.  There is never a single day that he refused or was reluctant to go to school, and this shows that the really engaging teachers and the environment.  Thank you Mindchamps@J10. It has been quite a journey and I can say that Kyler loves every part of it, especially the numerous party and costume dress up days! And special shout out to the dedicated teachers Ms. Paula, Gui laoshi, Ms. Charmaine, Ms Katie, Ms.Kaylyn, Ms. Esther and principal Ms. Sharlene!, Came here through a recommendation of a friend to view the school to enroll my first born. It was the second school we viewed and as we walked through and found out more about the activities and programs they will be going through, we were sold.  I like that they also incorporate music into studies so they can make use of their creativity.  I was worried if it would be difficult for her to fit in as she was going to be attending school for the first time in her life and because of COVID I could only be with her for half a day, but wow I‚Äôm so amazed at the adaptability and the welcoming of the teachers. They also made sure to update us a lot so we will feel at ease.  I can tell she really enjoys school and looks forward to going to school every day. Happy baby happy mummy.

Without a doubt, we signed up for Athena on the spot.  The school environment is very clean, organized, and well-thought out. It provides a conducive learning and safe playing environment for the children. The curriculum not only develops the child in academics, but it enhances their motor, emotional, musical, and social interaction abilities as well.

At just slightly over a year mark, we have noticed remarkable progress in Athena‚Äôs language, numeracy, and social interaction skills. From the early days of reaching the school entrance in tears to where we are today, she is loving and enjoying every little moment that she has spent in school.  Almost every other day, she would ecstatically return home and explain to us in great length on what she has done for the day. We were also pleasant to find that she has developed a good rapport with her class and several strong friendships within her classmates. It makes her day in school even more fulfilling.  Communication between the staffs and parents are transparent and prompt. Through digital means such as the MindChamps App and email, we are constantly being updated with our child‚Äôs progress and school matters.

The teachers and staffs at MCBKK were very professional and constantly update us about the happenings in school.

We like the personal touch of the place and clean, well maintained levels of sustenance. Kudos!, Our child has been attending school at MindChamps Buangkok for over a year now.

Great place to be in!, Our daughter commenced her journey at Mindchamps Buangkok (""MCBKK"") since N1 way back in early 2019.  She participated and we just attended her K2 graduation ceremony 3 weeks back and she will be leaving Mindchamps as a confident and articulate ""K3"" to start her P1 formal education very shortly.  During the course of the last 4 years, both my wife and I have much to thank the whole team at MCBKK principle, teachers and support staff.  It is inevitable that there will always be turnover for any childcare though I know MCBKK will try their best to retain and replace. Kids are also more resilient than what most parents think and adapt quickly.  Nonetheless as I reflect, would I have trusted my daughter with MCBKK all over again?  The answer is a definite ""yes' for the following reasons.  - Great partnership between parents and entire MCBKK team, bus driver and bus auntie included. - Genuine and professional teachers and staff who really care and bother - Clean, bright and cheerful environment - Holistic educational experience that covers English, Chinese, Math, reading, writing, physical education, art, gourmet, performance and music just to name some. - Honest and timely feedback from teachers - Supportive fellow parents and wonderful classmates  Covid was a trying period for all of us and I could appreciate the amount of consideration, stress and work that went behind as the MCBKK team tried to maintain a safe and healthy environment for the kids while keeping up with their programme.  Special mention Ms Ng, Ms Yun,  Ms Shannon, Ms Mabel, Ms Beth, Ms Amanda, Ms Cass, Ms Fu, Ms Stella and ex-teachers Ms Eileen and Ms Zhang Qian.  A big Thank You to all of you!  All of you have been instrumental in one way or another for our child's growing up journey.  We are always grateful and appreciative and definitely like to share our gratitude and experience with any parents who are currently in their taunting process of selecting a pre-school for their little ones.  There is no perfect pre-school but only the most suitable one. For us, we are happy to have partnered MCBKK for our child's journey.   She will be all ready for P1 in a few days' time. :-), Amazing environment with lovely teachers! We love teacher kym, highly recommended., The whole brain training championed by Mindchamps has worked well for my children in honing their academic and lingustic skills, sometimes I'm taken aback by the abilities my children have gained through their time at Mindchamps Buangkok which has a great team. And the brief exposure through Mindchamp's music curriculum seems to have made the miraculous difference., Great environment and teachers. My son is truly happy going to Mindchamp here., My son has been attending Mindchamps Buangkok for the past 1 year plus and we are really glad that we chose this preschool. He cannot speak or utter a single word when he first joined there, but under the care and guidance of the team, he is an expressive, active little boy now and likes to talk about anything under the sun in English and Mandarin! I would like to thank Miss Shannon, Miss Kym, Miss Ren and the rest of the team for taking such good care of him. The school has brought out his musical talents as well. I did not know that he likes to sing and has good rhythm in music! I am very assured that he is in good hands when he is there.

Through the patience and guidance of Miss Ng/ ‰∫ëËÄÅÂ∏à, my son is now able to read / write more confidently than before. I recalled when he first joined, his english writings were still shaky and he couldn't even write a single chinese word.  If not for my overseas assignment and we relocating, I would surely hope to see him finishing his K2 at mindchamp and getting ready for his Primary education. Once again, we appreciate the patience, love and guidance rendered to my son., Fun sports day for parent child bonding!, The school has such a friendly and warm vibe. Very enriching as well., It's the school holidays and we have been sending our son for holiday programmes to enrich his time. Last school holiday he attended MindChamps Actors Centre Kids Bootcamp and he was having a blast! The trainer is so engaging and he returns home each day excited about all that he did and learned during the session. MindChamps runs this bootcamp every school holiday. He is attending the 5-day programme for 3 1/2 hrs each day. He was supposed to attend this year but due to the current situation, he might just have to wait for next year but it's worth the wait., Very clean and well maintained center. Extremely responsive to queries. Both my children study here. Must applaud the teachers, support staff and management for their efforts .

Also, my daughters Chinese teacher (PG) gave my daughter chinese flashcards with English  to practice at home. Very impressive.. The teachers just don't so their job as a job. They take it more personal and are soo involved in the child's development . Even on the lines of character development, the teacher (k1 & k2) helps out during class to mould their behavior if you request them on specific aspects. Would like to thank all the teachers and staffs for doing a fantastic job. Overall  will surely recommend mindchamps @buangkok!, After months of searching for a preschool for my daughter, I have finally found Mindchamps Buangkok to be our preferred choice in this neighborhood. Likely to be one of the best that offers an all-rounded curriculum and one with personalized feedback .  We have seen a significant progression in our daughter's learning journey since she was transferred from another preschool at N1 last year. One example is that my daughter is able to recognise her name and write it independently now.  Kudos to the dedicated team that Principal Shannon leads. Their parent-teacher communication is clear and also insightful in understanding our daughter's personal growth, which is helpful to her growth not only in school but also at home.  The school also organizes monthly field trips that align with its curriculum, which is fantastic because the kids not only learn within a classroom setting but also experience it in a more practical setting.  Special shout out to the teachers, Ms. Kym, Fu laoshi, Ren laoshi, Ms. Cass, and Ms. Beverley & supporting staff for making my daughter, Klary, preschool's journey a fulfilling one., Great environment with loving teachers that aim to nurture our next generation., Sufficient parking lots and space , which is important for for parents ferrying children to school., Excellent outdoes family activities, Nice atmosphere and condusive environment!

"My daughter loves her teachers and her friends. She enjoys going to school everyday and I see her growing up with confidence and kindness ‚ù§Ô∏è Now that she graduated, I believe with all the support she was given at the school, she is well-prepared for the coming journey. Big thank to the school ü§© ‚Ä¶, The K2 graduation concert is awesome! Very well planned and great concept about go green! Thank you once again! Responsible teachers. Always having a smiley face. Thank you MindChamps teachers for always giving us the best :), I'm so grateful to found a preschool that my son love it. The services provided by teachers and staff are awesome.. they're so polite,caring,thoughtful towards the kids. I like the concepts of Mindchamp preschool to let kids to explore to new things.., Sending my son to MindChamps TPY is definitely the right move to kick start his school life. He really enjoys everyday in School with dedicated and friendly teachers and all the friends around him. The curriculums are well arranged to enhance not his knowledge but also life skills and confidence. The school also keeps an effective communication channel to keep the parents updated so that we can have a peace of mind. We sincerely recommend all the parents to consider this well established childcare centre for the benefits of your young champions., My Three loving Princess was in the TPY branch. The teachers are wonderful and Caring. Since the day they transfer from other school to MindChamps TPY , I could see their improvement on growing up skills. Languages, good self behaviour attitude and more . Appreciated and grateful thanks the the teachers and teams members on patiently taught on my 3 loving Champs., Our daughter has a great time (over 4 years) at MindChamps TPY. She enjoys the every moment at school. Even during the difficult times of Covid, the school staffs and teachers were doing a great job to ensure all champs‚Äô safety and happiness of studying at school. When coming to graduation, the K2 teachers arranged wonderful day-camp and programs for champs to have a great time. Highly recommended and Thumbs Up üëç !, I had a negative experience with MindChamps. I registered, paid a deposit, and two months' fees to secure a promotional rate during registration. I completed all required forms and waited for my daughter's class to begin in less than two months. However, about two to three weeks after registration, I received a call informing me of a fee increase.  The staff told me that if I do not agree with the increment, I can choose to withdraw and they will refund fully. But this was not what I was initially told during sign-up. I'm aware that I'm not the only parent affected by this.  MindChamps did not honor their promise, and the principal unashamedly mentioned a clause that is ‚Äòallowing them to change terms and conditions without notice‚Äô, which left me stunned.  Their sales tactic was to lock in a special 12-month fee promotion during the special registration period.  I find MindChamps Singapore's actions disappointing and unacceptable. But anyway, thanks to their management, this turned out to be a blessing in disguise for us. I'm extremely relieved that my child is not part of this school.  I personally know a few music teachers working at MC. While I understand that personal lives should generally not be intertwined with one's profession as a teacher working there, I can't help but feel a great sense of relief that my child is not being taught or cared for by certain music teachers., Nurturing and outstanding teachers, exceptional and sound curriculum. Capable management and administration. Always trusted them to take great care of my 3 kids, and provide them with an amazing education and environment!, My 2 children grew up with mindchamp preschool. I like how the school is wholistic in training up the children. Teachers are exceptionally professional and passionate. The school provides a clean and positive environment for the child to grow.

I can't imagine the efforts the teachers and champs been through for this. Kudos to the team at Mindchamps Toa Payoh for making it happen!, Fantastic event! All kids and parents have enjoyed so much! Really appreciate the effort from all the teachers and school stuff. good job!, Attended my girl K2 graduation and I have to see it was the best ever! Many many tear jerkers moments and I actually cried so many times. I can feel the hard work put in by the teachers. It is definitely not easy! More importantly, my child enjoyed every single moment! It was indeed a proud moment for everyone! Well done mindchamps!, Both of my kids went/go to MindChamps Toa Payoh. They enjoyed very much their learning journey and life at the childcare.  The teachers are all very friendly and amiable. You can feel their love of the kids from the moment the kids arriving at the school gate in the morning.  We also value the enriched curriculum and activities arranged by the school which prepare the kids for primary school life academically and non academically.

While preparation for Primary 1 is important, the champs also spend substantial time on learning various musical instruments (violin!), arts and crafts, cultural diversity and outdoor activities to stimulate development in other areas and build up their character.  Our girl was fortunate to be taught by several wonderful and dedicated teachers who are always looking out for her. The principal Veron, form teachers Mr. Tze and Êù®ËÄÅÂ∏à constantly updated us on her meltdowns in school and this helped us greatly in correcting her behavioral issues. Mr. Tze's encouraging and motivating attitude is really ""contagious"" and we could see our girl being influenced positively by him. Êü¥ËÄÅÂ∏à, whom we know so well by now and possibly the active longest-serving teacher there, will personally watch over her whenever she has her bad days and calm her down. Jerome and Katherine have also been proactive in sharing feedback on our girl‚Äôs development in music and reading. Our boy who is in Nursery was assigned to the young and vibrant pair of Â∞èÊÅ© and Tiffany who could match his energy levels and we could feel their genuine attachment to the toddlers under them from their dedication and efforts towards the preparation for the Year-End Musical showcase.  Location wise, the school may not be conveniently accessible but having its own little gym, library, and outdoor playground more than makes up for it. It can be quite a pain during wet weather as the walkway from the main road bus stop to the school is unsheltered.  To sum it up, MC Punggol team really outdone themselves in making the 2 biggest events of the year, the Family Fiesta and the Year-End Musical, a great success. I believe a lot of parents were touched by the performances and proud of their champs. The hours spent on choreographing the dance, rehearsals, handmaking the costumes and props is a testament to the passion and dedication of the whole MC Punggol team under the leadership of Veron. We are really grateful to the teachers who will be departing the school after leading the champs through these milestones in their preschool journey and for the positive impact on them. I would not hesitate to recommend MC Punggol to parents who are looking for a preschool and willing to pay more for the higher education standards and conducive environment.  PS: We were impressed by Sheryl's attentiveness to my dad's condition and for taking the initiative to change my parents' seats for the Musical. Also thanks to Principal Veron for offering the parking space within the school. These small gestures that leave the deepest impression are often overlooked., My girl loves her school at Mindchamps Punggol Northshore. She looks forward to seeing her teachers and her classmates everyday. We always see lots of energy and bright smiles from the teachers and school team! This is so assuring as we know our little one is in good hands. Thanks Ms Veron, Chai Laoshi, Ms Lara, Nana Laoshi, Ms Katherine, Me Jerome, Mr Calvin, Ms Regina, Ms Hanah and all MC Punggol team for making her school experience so enjoyable.  The school organises many fun events like Family Fiesta, learning journey outings, year end musical concert, centre open house experience day etc. The classrooms are so very lovely. We are all impressed by the thoughts that Ms Lara and Nana Laoshi put in for the creative classroom design!  We also greatly appreciate the assistant teachers and the school team's behind-the-scene support in taking care of the Champs. Hui Hui Laoshi does wonders with girls' hair braids (she can totally do a workshop on this!). Sheryl, Hui Yi and Mui Hong are always responsive when we need information. Last but not least, a big thanks to Ms Veron and Chai Laoshi for their passion, dedication and leadership. With principals who love children and education, plus a great team who share the same passion, we believe we will have many more memorable moments for our girl's pre-school journey with MindChamps Punggol., Mindchamps Northshore has effectively organized their classroom to accommodate all lesson materials, and the display of students' handiwork reflects the enjoyment your child experiences at school. Thanks to the efforts of the teachers at Mindchamps Northshore for creating such a positive environment., The MindChamps experience has been very memorable for my 2 children, not only in terms of curriculum but also the enrichment aspects in music, theatre etc so I don‚Äôt have to send my children to other enrichment activities. The emphasis on phonics and hanyu pinyin will greatly help my children in their transition to primary school!, Mindchamps Preschool Punggol is truly a remarkable institution that goes above and beyond in partnering with parents. Both of my kids attended this school from N1-K2, and I am incredibly impressed with the level of support and collaboration they have provided.  Under the guidance of Ms Veron, the principal, the school thrives as a nurturing and inspiring environment, with low turnover rate of teachers. This stability has allowed my kids to form deep connections with their teachers, fostering a sense of trust and support throughout their time at the school. Thank you.  I am grateful to the vice principal, Êü¥ËÄÅÂ∏à. She genuinely cares about the well-being of every child. She was no doubt, my kid‚Äôs favourite person in school! Her dedication I‚Äôve seen for the past 6 years was truly commendable.  I also would like to take this opportunity to give thanks to: Êù®ËÄÅÂ∏à, Mr Tze, Mr Jerome, Ms Katherine, Ms Kat, Ms Elsie, Ms Hui Yi and Mr Kelvin! You guys have played a pivotal role in my children‚Äôs growth and learning!  Lastly, I want to mention the recent graduation concert, which was a resounding success!  Thank you, Mindchamps Preschool Punggol, for providing an exceptional educational experience for my kids the past 6 years! Well done, Team Punggol!, A huge thank you to all the teachers and students for making the graduation concert a memorable one! We truly enjoyed every single minute of it. Special thanks to Mr Tze, who has been the pillar of support to both my child and our family from the day we joined the school üòÅ ‚Ä¶, 3 months since my girl in Mindchamps Preschool. Everyday I can see my girl is growing! Nice and safe environment for young child like her.  MC have curriculum update weekly alternate with English and Chinese, so parents can gets update what have they learnt in school.  My girl is currently at Playgroup level, i believe that her class teacher, Ms Nicola and Xie Lao Shi is taking care of her very well as she will be looking forward to school to meet her classmate and both of her teacher even thought she can‚Äôt really talk very well currently.  Kudos for the MC@Punggol Northshore teams! If there is any improvement that I can made comment of it, will be 1) I hope they will be more ‚Äúparents and child day at school‚Äù on some special occasion such as festival celebration/ father‚Äôs or mother day‚Äôs celebration etc. (but to be fair we are only at MC for 3 mths, they might hv planned it on diff occasions)  2) More photo update to parents esp for younger age group as is hard to ask them how‚Äôs their days in sch due to their language aren‚Äôt fully forms yet.  Otherwise I am happy that I have sent my girl to Mindchamps üòå, Hereby to send my heartfelt gratitude to MindChamps Team of inspiring teachers at Punggol Northshore, your dedication to nurturing young minds is truly commendable. Thank you for your unwavering commitment to excellence in education.  - Zayden K2R Parents 2023, Wanna say a Big Thank You to everyone in Mindchamps Punggol for putting up a world class musical production for this yr K2 graduation. It's a wonderful experience and good exposure for my girl for her graduation concert. Watching her performed confidently on the stage give us so much joy. It's a perfect ""finale"" for her life in preschool and looking forward to Pri phase.  My girl joined MC since N2 and she always enjoyed her school. Never I had a problem sending her to class. She has grown to be a confident and well-mannered Champ.  We wanna thank all the teachers, helper teachers, staffs who has poured their lives to make her Preschool journey a fruitful and joyous one.  Special mention to Yang Laoshi, Mr Tze, Ms Katherine, Mr Jerome, Mr Kelvin who make learning so fun and meaningful. Thanks to Ms Veron, Chai Laoshi, Ms Huiyi for taking care and creating a welcoming and positive environment in MC Punggol. All of you are the Mighty Champs too!!!  Thank You MindChamps!, I recently had the pleasure of attending a school tour conducted by the school and I couldn't be more impressed. From the moment I stepped onto the campus, I was greeted with warmth and enthusiasm. The facilities were top-notch, with bright and inviting classrooms and plenty of engaging play areas. What truly stood out, however, was the dedication and passion of the teachers. They not only showcased a deep understanding of early childhood development but also exuded genuine care and excitement for their work. The curriculum presented during the tour aligned perfectly with our family's educational values, emphasizing hands-on learning and fostering a love for exploration and discovery. One particular moment that touched me was seeing my son performance with his friends. Overall, our experience on the tour was great. Look forward to more of such activities in school with my son., I want to extend my heartfelt thanks to Teacher Tiffany, Â∞èÊÅ©ËÄÅÂ∏à, and all the Mindchamps Punggol staff for the incredible guidance and support they have provided to my son during his time at school. He joined in June, and I have already noticed a significant improvement in him. He enjoys sharing his school‚Äôs daily routine and stories about his friends with us when he comes back home. I can truly feel that he is genuinely enjoying his time at school., I am very pleased in this school in terms of the staff, teachers, curricilum, and the environment. We send our 2 kids there and every time we pick them up they will share to us how exciting their day was. Teachers always update us our kid's progress every week. I like how they teach not only in academics but also how they mold the students to be independent and confident. There's so much good to tell about mindchamp northshore., MindChamps @ Punggol Northshore successfully organised a musical yesterday afternoon whereby preschool children from as young as 18 months to 6 years of age performed confidently on a huge stage, with bright stage lights and hundreds of audience! It was really amazing to see these brave young children doing their best on a stage like this. Kudos to the entire staff from MCPN for preparing the children so well. Special thanks to Â®úÂ®úËÄÅÂ∏à, Ms Lara, Ms Regina,  Ms Hanah , Mr Calvin for teaching and guiding my child and to the staff (for instance Principal Ms Veron, Êü¥ËÄÅÂ∏à, Mr Jerome) in the musical core organising committee, well done! Shoutout to the admin team for ensuring a smooth run of the event, particularly Ms Sheryl , who could recognise the parents upon admission. This added a personal touch.  As a parent, it was heartwarming to see my child, not even 3 years of age, singing, dancing and playing a musical instrument on stage! He dressed up in a costume that was partly hand-made by him as well! üëçüèªüëçüèª, I speak from the experience of being a father of two who are attending Mindchamps Punggol Northshore, and this is my honest opinion of the establishment.  Location wise it might not be the most convenient to some, but the environment and infrastructure together with real estate space more than makes up for it. I have been impressed by the general state of cleaniness and hygiene control of the school whenever I visit the place, and the seemingly much lower rates of HFMD/Influenza spreads within the school is probably a good tesitmony of that.  While as with every establishment we cannot expect the quality of every single teacher to be of the highest standard of excellence, I have observed that generally most if not all of the staffs have displayed a good level of understanding with regards to how they should effectively carry themselves in various situations. It is clear that training is prioritized on a management level for that to be achieved (think Hai Di Lao, but for schools).  A huge plus point is it's not uncommon to see staffs who are truly passionate about what they do and enjoy being surrounded by kids. Annoyance or irritation from the staff is an extremely rare sight if any. I am impressed by how most of the staff make the effort to know every child's name and even attempt to build rapport with each of everyone of them. It's comforting to know that there are multiple staffs and teachers who approach their work with their hearts daily.  I do not think this would be possible without the likes of Ms Veron, Mr Jerome and Cai Laoshi (to name a few but there's more), who have definitely helped in creating a healthy culture and environment within the establishment for children to grow and shine in.  I dare confidently say that most children who graduate from Mindchamps Punggol Northshore will enjoy a headstart in their primary school journey. Would highly recommend if cost is not a factor, as I'd see it as a foundational investment in our children and their future., Both my kids are with Mindchamps Punggol Northshore. The teachers are very dedicated and takes really good care of the students wellbeing. Most importantly my kids enjoy school!, Kudos to the teachers for their patience handling young children into school.  It‚Äôs not an easy  task. It's amazing to see the teachers greet the kiddos by their name. Nice to see the progress in my daughter, from a shy to confident girl today.  She shared many happy moments daily about her teachers and friends in preschool., All teachers in Punggol Mindchamps are very warm and put in alot of effort in guiding the students. No regrets at all for putting both my kids there!, Mindchamps Punggol organizes great activity like the Chinatown heritage tour that involves parents with great bonding time with our champs to go through the activities together., Putting 2 of my children here is one of the best decision we have made. My daughter (eldest) has been there since PG till K1 now. Teachers are passionate and genuinely caring. The program is designed to address various aspects, not just academic, this includes musical, gourmet, art & craft and few others.  At the same time, we also want to commend and express our gratitude to the teachers and staffs for the recent Family Fiesta on 1st June. It was thoughtfully planned and executed, both our kids had great fun there!, I'm a parent of 2 kids who are currently in this branch for about 4 years and lucky to have found this branch for our kids.  The branch has a strong curriculum and always has the kids' well-being as their priority. While there is a strong curriculum in place, they also teach based on the class's interest. This is important to sustain kids' curiosity in learning.  For example for N1 classes learning about farm animals, The teachers will hold conversations with the kids and find out their interests. With this, class A would have a slightly different aspect from class B based on their kid's interests. With the opening up from covid situation, they have increased their excursions, such as theatre play, goat farm, crocodile farms as well! The kids enjoyed themselves a lot.  The teachers are dedicated and always go above and beyond their primary responsibility. They always provide timely and valuable feedback on your kids and allow parents to know how they are in school, etc. The principal and admin staff are very responsive as well.  All in all, I would say that this branch is indeed a flagship branch of mind champ where they have a good curriculum, good systems and processes, good teachers, and admin staff.  Do note that not all mind champ branches are the same. After hearing about the experiences that my friends had with other branches. I'm lucky to have found this branch., First time joining the school excursion with my son. It was a fun day at Chinatown. Thank you to all teachers for planning this outing., The year end performance was a delight with the kids putting in their best performance. The school and the teachers put in their upmost effort in making this memorable performance for the kids and parents!, Today's parent workshop affirmed my choice of choosing Mindchamps for my children. Mr Tze and Guo Laoshi has displayed their dedication and professionalism , and shared with me fun ways of reading with my children. GREAT WORK MINDCHAMPS !, I couldn't be happier with my daughter's experience at this MindChamps Punggol . The teachers and staff are caring, creative, and dedicated to providing a nurturing environment for all of the children. The facilities are safe, clean, and well-equipped for learning and play. My daughter has made so many friends and has developed crucial social and educational skills, thanks to the exceptional instruction she has received. I would highly recommend this kindergarten to any parent who wants the best for their child., It‚Äôs the best decision ever to place my daughter in Mindchamps Punggol. Ms Jodee has been very attentive to her needs and is constantly providing us with updates on how she‚Äôs doing in school.  I recall once when my daughter was having a really bad cough. Ms Jodee called and told me that I should bring her to the doctor for early intervention as she felt that something wasn‚Äôt right with the way she was coughing back then.  Thank you Ms Jodee and Ms Veron for holding the ‚Äòfort‚Äô when the working mummies are at work., A big shout out to MindChamps Punggol Team!  I have heard so much about MindChamps and, through a friend‚Äôs referral, decided to enrol my daughter.  The parents‚Äô workshops gave me a deeper understanding of the curriculum and how to support and guide my daughter‚Äôs learning from home. I am now 100% assured of MindChamps curriculum and teachers preparing my daughter for her further learning journey., MindChamps Punggol Team is always responsive to feedback. My happy child is always full of smiles when we pick her up. I attribute this to the exemplary teaching and community feel of the school., It's been a very enjoyable few years at Mindchamps Punggol Northshore, where our child has had a very enriching curriculum taught by very caring teachers.  Ms Huiyi, Mr Jerome, Ms Elsie, Â∞èÈõ®ËÄÅÂ∏à, Ms Nor, Ê¢¶ËÄÅÂ∏à, Ms Katherine, Ms Lash and Mr Kelvin are just some of our child's teachers, whom we would really like to thank for their patience and dedication.  The recent Fiesta was also a great success! It was fun for everyone and encouraged greater bonding among families and friends. Thank you teachers for all the hard work! :), My son has been with Mindchamps Punggol Northshore for close to a year. He has been having a great time and learning a lot.  Thank you to all teachers and staff! ü•∞  We also enjoyed the Family Fiesta Day with the teachers and staffs. It was a great event. Well organized, thoughtful and fun!, Happy and pleased with the school environment, as my boy has been with MC for almost a year, I can say that he has shown progress and improvement on his learning and attitude. Teachers are very patience and friendly as well. My son likes the classroom setting, especially the teachers that he keeps on mentioning at home. Would like to express my thanks to Ms Yvonne, Nana Lao shi for being patient with my son during school time and all the teachers/staffs that are present every morning and evening time during pick up time üòä, My daughter attended Mindchamps Punggol since Playground and she is in N2 now. The teachers are caring and attentive. Senior Principal is experienced. My daughter enjoys and looks forward to school everyday. The curriculum is wonderful and classes are conducted in lively and fun manner but strict when required. The music class conducted is more than learning music and very impressive. A highly recommended preschool!, I am incredibly impressed with MindChamps Pre-School and the exceptional level of care they have provided to my child.  Recently, we had expressed concerns about our child's behavior at school, and the school principal and teachers immediately took action to address our concerns. They were very attentive and empathetic, and we felt heard and understood. With their help, our child has made significant progress in just one month, becoming more self-assured, confident, and happy.  We are grateful for the exceptional level of care and guidance provided by Ms. Si Ying, Li Laoshi, Chai Laoshi, Huihui Laoshi and Mr Jerome and all the other teachers who have played a vital role in our child's development. I also want to give a special shout-out to the school principal Ms Veron for her immediate actions and caring of my child. Her support and involvement were greatly appreciated and have made a significant impact on our child's progress.  The school really cares about every single feedback and takes immediate actions from all the staffs. Overall, we highly recommend MindChamps Pre-School to any parent looking for a safe, nurturing, and stimulating learning environment for their child. Thank you for your dedication and positive impact on our child's growth and development., My 4 year old is enrolled here and waking up for nursery is one of her daily highlights. The teachers and the admin stuff have so much energy and patience for the little ones. It is the details that make this environment stand out. Apart from just nurturing the children, they are equally passionate in guiding us parents through workshops, bite sized info and just heartfelt pointers when we pick our children up. Great educational activities, lovely staff and a huge recommend., My son joined Mindchamps playgroup in March 2023 - he‚Äôs not the easiest nut to crack, he‚Äôs always been a rather sensitive boy, very attached to me and very slow to warm up to new situations, but he very quickly got over the initial tear-filled transition period and fell in love with the school.  These days, seeing him eagerly and excitedly reach for his teachers to baobao / run into the gate in the morning, beaming widely at pickup everyday and speaking fondly of his friends and teachers in school really puts an anxious mother‚Äôs heart at great ease. He‚Äôs truly grown and learnt so much in a short span of 6 months.  An enormous thank you - especially to his 2 main teachers Ms Sonia and Pan Laoshi, enrichment teachers and all other teachers (including Mr Jerome, Ms Hanah, Mr Calvin, Chai laoshi) who have undeniably one by one won my little boy‚Äôs heart over - for giving him the warmth and security and patience and love to help him settle in fully and find a second home in Mindchamps @ Northshore!

Not forgetting my boy's teachers, Teacher Tiffany Âíå Â∞èÊÅ©ËÄÅÂ∏à, Thank you for caring for our son so that we can feel at peace at work.

Through the months we can see her opening up, becoming a cheerful and outgoing girl. She enjoyed school so much, even ran in some days without saying bye to us.

Thank you for making the school a safe and fun place to be in! :), MindChamps Northshore had recently organised a numbers of Workshops to provide parents with insights on the core and enrichment curriculum from PG to K2. I had attended 2 workshops - Music and Natural Literacy; where I learnt to recognised scale pattern and musical rhythm (MindChamps unique creation) taught to Champs in music enrichment classes. And, Natural Literacy, where I took away mindful tips in communication with my child.  Goal of the workshops is to encourage and equip parents with know-how to achieve consistent learning with Champs outside of school.  The parents engaging workshops is an initiative by MindChamps Northshore Principal and Teachers as they hope to improve and achieve consistent learning throughout the Champs preschool journey.  Parents engagement to this level is rare. I am appreciative of the Principal ‚Äì Ms Veron and Teachers who constantly create and encourage a good environment for learning to the Champs and parents. I have endless compliments. Thank you for all you do! Looking forward to more engagement program for parents!

We have full trust in MindChamps Northshore teachers and staffs that our daughter will be nurture to ""being the true Champion to be the best she can be""!, The school is very well-managed, and provides a holistic environment for the children to develop and thrive in both academic and non-academic ways.  We see a lot of efforts being put in by the school in many aspects: keeping the environment clean and safe, ensuring hands-on and interactive learning (both indoor and outdoor), nurturing the child‚Äôs character development, and engaging parents through timely communications, workshops and activities etc.  Its outdoor playground is sheltered, which gives children the opportunity to outdoor play even with unpredictable weather conditions. Excursions and school-learning activities are well-planned, having the children‚Äôs interests at heart is behind the core of the school‚Äôs planning and design for many things.  Most importanly, the school gives a great sense of transparency, and both teachers and staff are caring and nurturing with a passion. We have seen how our child grown to be an independent and confident individual who enjoys learning and looks forward to school.  A very big thank you to Ms Veron and everyone at Mindchamps Punggol who have put in relentless efforts to create a safe and conducive environment for the children!, My eldest daughter is of pre-school going age. I was nervous and anxious to ensure that she goes to the best pre-school to equip and prepare her for primary school. With so many choices of pre-school out there I was unsure which is the best for my daughter.  One of the reason why I chose Mindchamps Pre-School@ Punggol is because they offer workshops that parents can attend.  The parent workshop was very informative and explained the challenges faced by pre-schoolers as they transit from pre-school into primary school. In addition to teaching the basic academic skills, the workshop explained how they build the children‚Äôs confidence to face these challenges.  I‚Äôm very impressed by the teachers in recognising that there are more to education than just  academic abilities. A holistic education including building the children EQ and confidence is also required. This puts Mindchamps workshops apart from the other educational providers. It‚Äôs well worth my time in attending the workshop., I‚Äôm Luka‚Äôs Dad and my son has been in MC from the beginning of this year. I‚Äôd really say that the caring and enthusiasm of all the form teachers(Ms Regine, Ms Guo and Mdm Chai) enable my son to be a much more sociable and interactive child who used to be at his own all the time. Despite the fact that my son had made huge progress in both linguistics, math and other aspects, I‚Äôm really grateful that he had a great time and being accompanied by the best teacher group in the world. Thank you MindChamps!, My girl attended Mindchamps since playgroup till now she is K1. We absolutely love the school environment, teachers and school curriculum.  1. School environment Every class has their own classroom which is really important during covid period. The school compound is large, allowing children to move around easily. There are 2 huge playground for the champs to play. My girl loves them a lot. She also enjoys experiencing outdoor learning since they are close to the sea view.  2. Since playgroup, she is blessed to meet very nice and caring teachers who took care of them and see her grow from a little girl who needs to wear diaper to a little girl who is learning how tonuse toilet and now finally she is able to use toilet independently. We are very thankful to her teachers for everything that they have done to make school so fun for my daughter. We are not worry of her attending school as we know that she is in good hands. Shout out to Ms Nicola, Xie Laoshi, Xiaoyu Laoshi, Ms Cheryl and Qing Qing Laoshi, thank you!  3. We are happy with the school curriculum. My girl enjoy going to school everyday. She learnt a lot and I can see improvement in her every week. She enjoys learning Chinese, phonics, neuromoves, music, gourmet class, etc., While our daughter is one that has issues adapting to a new environment, we were constantly assured by a team of dedicated and caring teachers. For the past month, they have been our dependable partner in ensuring that our little one continue to be resilient in stepping out of her comfort zone. We would like to specially thanks Chai Laoshi for receiving my crying girl and coax her patiently during arrival in school every morning.

It was a fun and great learning experience for parents., My boy has been attending playgroup in Mindchamps Punggol Northshore Center since early Jan. As parent, we are amazed to witness his amazing improvement in terms of behaviours and language development.  We are surprised to see that he is able to say simple words and numbers just after one week attending school and he is able to speak those words newly learned in school. He becomes more and more talkative even greeting strangers in the lift since attending school.  Secondly, we observed that he has developed some good habits. He can return the plates and cups after eating and drinking at home. And when we say wash before having meals, he automatically go to washroom and stand on his stool and open water tap to wash hands. Thanks to school to nurture them be more independent.  Moreover, teachers provides us timely updates in terms of their learning progress, this is also essential for parents to facilitate to enhance their memory and understanding mutually.  Most importantly, we found that he is so excited to go school every single day.  We are grateful to his teachers Ms Nicola, Ë∞¢ËÄÅÂ∏à, Yao laoshi, Ms hanah, Ms Regina,Êü¥ËÄÅÂ∏à together with the whole team Principal Ms Veron, Ms Mui Hong, Ms Huiyi. They are pretty professional and efficient to handle all the queries and provide assistance., My son Brayden has been attending Mindchamps Punggol Northshore since PG and I have never regard sending him there. In the past, as the like of many parents with child of 18 months, my wife and I have been searching high and low for a pre-school and Veron has been a star to provide us with a guided tour and  clearly explain the school curriculum which is tailor towards holistic development (SMILES). Looking back, Brayden has developed self-confident, being vocal and learning languages/Counting/Music etc. Of course, all these coaching comes with the care and patient from his teachers!! Kudos to all of them.  The school also have an APP, which provide the parent with temperature checks, attendants, happenings, events, interaction with teachers etc, which makes easy access to updates.  Overall, from my personal view, Mindchamps Punggol Northshore is highly recommended to parents looking for pre-school in North East.  Special thanks to teachers such as Teacher Ana, Zhen Lao Shi and Xie Lao Shi, for part of Brayden learning and growing journey !! Also thanks to Ms Veron who is always readily to support parents who have any question/request., Would like to thanks the teacher for all the effort given to the champ. Was a great experience for my little champ and ourselves. Great job, Really appreciate the teachers putting in time and effort to prepare a class for parents to better understand how they're learning in class as well as to provide ideas and tools to continue student's learning at home. It's a pity this is the first time they've done so though because of COVID. But it's definitely much appreciated. The app recommendation was also great..thank you., Very well planning and good show for young kids to performance so well üëè Good job for Senior Principal & Teachers and Team .üòç ‚Ä¶, Fantastic event and very warm heartening to watch all the kids performing in their most natural ways :), I'd like to affirm the good work that the teachers and staff have done, especially those mentioned below:  Thank you foremost to my son's class teachers - Ms Siying, ÊùéËÄÅÂ∏à, and Ms Huihui. We as parents are well aware that handling a very active and restless child like my son isn't the easiest, but the teachers try their best and are transparent about how they manage and at times discipline him. My special thanks to ÊùéËÄÅÂ∏à - her updates (through phonecalls and chats  during pickup) are always very astute, sharp and insightful. It only goes  to show she isn't just child minding - she is thoughtful about the children's behaviour and tries to interpret what they might mean. It means a lot to me that she takes the time to troubleshoot issues with me, and never once comes across as judgemental. This is so important to a parent.  2) Thank you to the enrichment teachers too - Mr Jerome, Ms Lash, and Ms Hanah. My son comes back telling me all sorts of things he's learnt ‚Äî log rolling in gym class, takadimi rhythm in music class, and spheres (!) in literacy class. It's really funny and heartening at the same time. And he's only 3!  3) And lastly to everyone else - principal Ms Veron, admin staff and the other teachers : thank you for always being welcoming and smiley during drop off (even when us as parents are not! üòÇ). It makes a difference how kids are welcomed.  Thank u Mindchamps Northshore :), My child has been studying here for half a year. He has changed a lot and learned a lot. The teacher is also very caring! The school activities are also very rich, and the children like it very much!, Mr Tze is an energetic and passionate teacher. He is creative and always goes above and beyond to ensure the champs enjoy learning! He has been spot on about my sons challenges despite it being very early into the year and we have tremendous trust that he will push our child to his highest potential. Mr Tze relates to parents very well being a father himself and is always reassuring! We are very lucky to have Mr Tze teach our son this year and hope many other students get to benefit from him !, My daughter has been with MC Northshore for about 2 years already.  Apart from the comprehensive curriculum, healthy and varied meals and conducive learning environment, what impresses me most is the quality of both teaching and non-teaching staff and the way the school is run. My daughter loves her class teachers from now and before and has learnt so much since she started school. All thanks to Ms Nicola, ÈÉëËÄÅÂ∏àÔºåË∞¢ËÄÅÂ∏àÔºåÂ∞èÈõ®ËÄÅÂ∏à, Ms Lash, Ms Regina and Ms Katherine for teaching and nurturing my daughter and her classmates!  Random but commendable point to note - MC Northshore‚Äôs disease/virus control is pretty good. Deep cleaning is done almost after the discovery of a covid case and parents are updated timely on any infectious diseases cases (covid, hfmd, etc)., I was amazed by the Centre Tour @ Mindchamps MCC. The reception was welcoming coupled with the admin staff' friendly and affable attitude. The Principal was knowledgeable, showing intelligence and strong depth of understanding in children's cognitive development in their formative years., Our daughter started MindChamps at Punggol at the start of this year. The teachers here were very patient and my daughter enjoys going to school everyday. Will like to take this opportunity to thank all her teachers in N1G, Ms Si Ying, ÊùéËÄÅÂ∏àÔºå Ms Lash, Ms Hanah, Ms HuiYi, Mr Jerome, XinEn Lao Shi and Ms Hui Hui, not forgetting Principal Veron as well. We can see the confidence in Toni and the progress she's making. She has learnt to be independent as well. She will tell us that she likes Ms Si Ying and ÊùéËÄÅÂ∏à. Teachers are very important in a child's learning journey. We are glad that her teachers had taught her well. Thank you teachers!, My son has been with Punggol Northshore Mindchamp for more than a year since he was 22 months old.  What first made me chose this school is the curriculum of Mindchamp, the good reputation and the school‚Äôs cleanliness & environment.  I am glad to have sent my boy to Mindchamp punggol because I observed how well-run this place is, passionate teachers and how well-thought lesson plans their have.  1. The teachers truly cares for the students through small little actions that I have observed. They are patience, caring and well-trained. My boy feels very comfortable with them. 2. What impresses me is that all teachers receiving and sending off the kids at the reception remember each and every student names! How attentive it is. 3. The principal, Ms Veron runs the school very well. She is hands-on, decisive, attentive, and approachable. She impresses me with how she handles every covid situation - transparent reporting, clear instruction and personally calling parents to follow-up. With her running the school, it gives me assurance.  I strongly recommend Mindchamp Punggol as the school of choice., Love ‚Äúa million dreams‚Äù outstanding performance! Appreciate the teacher and staff million effort!, My daughter has been attending Mindchamps Punggol Northshore since she was 2 years old(PG).  If you are looking for a school with comprehensive curriculum, this is the school that you can consider.  The champs learnt and gained knowledge through enquiry learning, which I think it is a fun way of learning.  Their focus is not only on academic wise, they also build the champs' character, self-esteem, emphasising on mannerism.  There are always timely updates on latest cases on HFMD/Covid on teacher-parent apps, which is really assuring especially when they ensure deep cleaning is carried out each time.  Special thanks to all the teachers that Annabelle has crossed paths with during her learning journey in Mindchamps Punggol, especially her current teachers Ms Elsie and Wang Lao Shi.  Through the committed educators' guidance, Annabelle is a happy, confident, independent child., We sincerely like to thank Ms Veron for giving our daughter an opportunity to join MindChamps PreSchool @ Punggol Northshore, which had made a vast impact on her developmental journey which is extremely important to a young child growth.  As parents, we witnessed our child distinctive improvements on her social interactive skills, speech and language developments within the first 6-months especially in K1.  Lastly, we would also wish to express our deepest gratitudes to all the teachers and Ms Veron support team whom have also helped our daughter through for her developmental milestones journey with MindChamps PreSchool @ Punggol Northshore.  Appreciate and thank you very much., I enrolled my son in Mindchamps Northshore when he was 23 months old. Though his development was slow for a start, it began to improve in leaps and bounds under the guidance of the esteemed team of educators.   My son is blessed with wonderful teachers who provide timely feedback. The curriculum offered by Mindchamps is comprehensive. My son has enjoyed his journey at Mindchamps thus far and is looking forward to the coming days., Wonderful team of teaching staff. My son look forward to school everyday, It‚Äôs a good school with a lot activities, my kid is having fun at school!, I want to special thanks principal and teachers in MindChamps punggol especially Ms Ayu and Ms Ma(chinese teacher) for their efforts and special attention towards my child and also towards all other kids in the school.My child had been with the school for the 2nd year and is so comfortable and cheerful when in school, she also appeared to be happy whenever attending school every morning, she learnt how to speak and also like to sing before going to bed, I known she enjoy her day in MindChamps punggol and before that I had intention to move to the west and try to locate another pre school for my child, but after some careful consideration that she may not have the same feeling and standard in other school so I decided to let her stay and continue her learning development with MindChamps. Thank you so much Ms Veron, Ms Ayu and Ms Ma and all teachers in MindChamps punggol for your care, teaching and attentions to all the kids out there., My son has been with Mindchamps Punggol Northshore since PG,it has been a fruitful learning journey these 4 years. School supported us by equipping him with lifeskills in self management during the early years. With the rich learning from the core and enrichment programme,he truly enjoy himself in the full day programme. He is well taken care of by the team of caring staff and dedicated teachers. Special thanks to all staff and teachers in Mindchamps Punggol Northshore., Â≠ôËÄÅÂ∏à from Northshore Mindchamps has touched us immensely during the difficult period of constant Covid outbursts in the country. Alongside the principal, she would not only call us to show concern when we are unable to send our child, with low immunity, to school, she would send us comprehensive notes of study and slides of the chinese classes missed to ensure our child is able to catch up with the syllabus. All these efforts spent despite her being heavily pregnant. Our English speaking child now sings Chinese songs, recites Chinese poems and is able to recognise and read Chinese words when back home from school. Truly a relief in this duo-language educational system from an academic progress perspective. Most of all, Â≠ôËÄÅÂ∏à has demonstrated the true spirit of an educator every student deserves., I enrolled my son in MC Punggol when he was 22 months old. Four years along the way, he has been blessed with awesome teachers who understand his challenges, strength, and nurture him with great passion and patience.  The facilities in the centre are great too, with a big outdoor playground equipped with slides, castles. There is also one music room and gym room in the centre. My son was encouraged to explore his curiosities to learn Languages, Music, and Sciences. From a shy little boy to a K2 ‚Äúgraduate-to-be‚Äù, we saw how he had grown up with great confidence and happiness. Most important of all, he had built up great relationships with his friends and teachers and interacted with them with love and respect. Big applause to the entire teaching staff and management team in MC Punggol Northshore! Special thanks to Chai Lao shi, Wang Laoshi,Ms. Veron, Ms. Elsie, Ms Ayu, Ms Catherine and many more!, I had the opportunity to visit Mindchamp Punggol past week . Ms Veron the senior principal of the centre was kind enough to show me around. I was enthralled by exburence of centre ..the creativity and imagination of the centre children guided by the dedicated teachers was awesome n .refreshing..Kudos to Ms Veron and the teachers, Teachers are passionate and patient to students. Very happy with sending our child to this school. Thanks Teachers!!, Thank you to every teacher at Mindchamps Punggol Northshore, it's really great! Great centre with friendly and professional staff. The centre is well presented and very clean, the areas for the children have great toys and amazing large outdoor yard., Massive campus with big classrooms to facilitate learning. Huge outdoor playground and surrounded by the shoreline and greenery that makes learning a lot more engaging., Highly rated center where teachers go over and beyond and kids benefit from the nurturing culture. The champs grow up to be confident and vocal with a never-give-up mindset., A Great workshop that allowed me to learn more creative ways to teach my child, and for my child to build more interest in storytelling. A different way of learning through storytelling as well., A frustrating ordeal for me to simply have my deposit balance refunded after my son‚Äôs withdrawal on 31 Dec 2022. Admin keeps on saying will call us back but no one called and no update. Had to call HQ and again told me to wait for another 7 days.  I‚Äôve had my share of ups and downs with this preschool., Best choice of preschools in Punggol - enrolled my boy into it since his PG and the school has been nurturing him with good care and their best-in-class curriculums. A fun, fruitful and enjoyable learning experience for preschoolers.",0.2972164727633475,4,"['teacher', 'school', 'child', 'ms', 'mindchamps', 'thank', 'punggol', 'parent', 'learn', 'northshore', 'staff', 'good', 'year', 'great', 'experience', 'kid', 'daughter', 'son', 'champ', 'environment']",MindChamps PreSchool @ Punggol
"Switched my child when she was in N2 for the main reason of exposing her to Mandarin. Overall, the school provides a nurturing and stimulating environment. Teachers are knowledgeable, patient, and creative, ensuring that every child receives individualized attention and support. The curriculum is engaging and age-appropriate, promoting holistic development. Communication with parents is excellent, fostering a strong partnership between home and school.  There is some room for improvement as I do note the high turnover rate of the staff. Overall, Mindchamps Thomson is a wonderful place for children to learn, grow, and thrive. My child loves school and looks forward to the lessons, My daughter (now in K1)  has been at this school since playgroup and my son just started playgroup this year. Enrolling my son was an easy decision seeing how my daughter has blossomed over the years at mindchamps. The smaller class sizes ensure that students get personalised attention from teachers, who are truly invested in their learning. Lessons, while conducted within the theme/topic for the term,  are nonetheless adjusted to the children‚Äôs interests, ensuring that the children remain excited to keep on learning. Indeed, the teachers make mindchamps special. It is clear from conversations with them that they are extremely dedicated to their craft and caring for the children, not just the children in the class they teach but the children across all levels. My son‚Äôs current teacher, who also taught my daughter in her nursery years, still interacts with my daughter regularly and provides me with feedback. My daughter‚Äôs teachers are also constantly looking out for my son and providing me with updates on how he is adjusting to school. I‚Äôm ever grateful and thankful to my mindchamps village for providing such a safe and loving environment for my children to learn and grow. The school has certainly gone through rough patches with higher teacher and principal turnover. But the teachers that remain are true gems and I sincerely hope the administration does everything they can to retain the teachers and provide greater and longer term stability., This preschool has inept, unresponsive franchise owners, whose poor management has caused high staff turnover and distrust from many parents.  Our child was with MindChamps Thomson Chinese Preschool for K1 and K2, graduating in 2023. We chose this school as we wanted a Mandarin-immersion programme near our home. While our child had good teachers throughout the two years there, unfortunately, the school was very poorly managed. During this period, 4 principals resigned (the 5th principal will be starting in late-Jan 2024), along with all 6 of our child‚Äôs teachers.  What is worse is that these 6 teachers left with little to no notice period given to the parents or children. This is despite the management being aware that they resigned several months ahead of time. They deliberately required the teachers not to tell the parents, giving no time for a proper farewell and showing little regard for the relationship between the teachers and the children. The school environment was therefore very unstable, making it difficult for children to form a relationship of trust with their teachers. Just imagine how your child would feel if they started trusting a teacher, only to see her suddenly depart, time after time.  During the first wave of resignations in 2022, we were among a group of 9 families who collectively wrote a letter to the franchise owners to express our grave concern. We were deeply dissatisfied with the high staff turnover and their decision to announce the teachers‚Äô departure at very short notice (i.e. 1 day before her last day). Notably, the owners did not bother to respond to us at all. Instead, the new principal tried to assure us she would right the ship. She worked hard and seemed sincere, but soon resigned as well. While we certainly considered changing school, eventually we kept our child there because of the existing friendships and the new teachers were good. It‚Äôs also rather disruptive to change school with just a year to go.  The K2 year was more stable ‚Äì we thought the management had finally met minimal standards. Unfortunately, that was not to be the case.  In mid-December 2023, both the K2 teachers left the school abruptly. Once again, the management kept the news from us until 3 days before the teachers‚Äô final day. This was baffling, given that the parents had already paid the school fees for December, so they could have given more time to allow the children to process the end of these treasured relationships.  From these actions, it is clear that the franchise owners of MindChamps Thomson are lacking in management and people skills. Worse, they do not listen to feedback. Principals did not stay more than 6 months, they could not explain the decisions of the franchise owners, and good teachers left very suddenly, in an unnecessarily disruptive manner. We have no confidence in the franchise owners, and believe parents should know about their history before deciding to enrol.  Ultimately, while the teachers are good and committed, the preschool management is not child-centric. Here is a final example: MindChamps Thomson scheduled the K2 graduation concert on 3 December, obviously to get parents to pay for that month‚Äôs enrolment. Several families planned to travel in Dec to visit family overseas etc and thus appealed to have the concert earlier. However, the management rejected the appeal. As a result, several children were not allowed to join the graduation concert, even if their parents were willing to pay the $373 concert/graduation package. This is simply mean and profit-obsessed. Most other preschools hold their graduation concerts in November, and even October.  We think teachers, parents and children deserve much better., My wife and I couldn't be happier with our experience at Thomson MindChamps Chinese Preschool! Our first born has been attending for several months now, and we have been consistently impressed with the quality of care and education provided. The teachers are all incredibly dedicated, knowledgeable, and patient, and they truly go above and beyond to make sure every child is thriving. Our child has learned so much during their time at the preschool, from Mandarin language skills to socialization and problem-solving skills. We also appreciate the emphasis on play-based learning and hands-on activities. The facilities are clean, bright, and well-equipped, and the communication with parents is excellent. Overall, we would highly recommend Thomson Chinese Preschool to any parent looking for a nurturing, enriching, and fun environment for their child's early education., I wanted what is best for my first born that this why I never hesitate to bring him to MindChamps. I have heard a lot of positive reviews about this center and I wanted to see for my self. Facilities are indeed child friendly and conducive for learning.  They have this systematic scheme that the child would be learning and enjoying because they thought that they were only playing. Teachers are also fun loving too. My child really enjoys to follow what his teacher sings and dances. That is worth of every dollar I spend., Kids learn faster than adults and, being 50% Chinese, I believe it is essential that our children be exposed to the Chinese culture and language early on. This will enable them to tap into the advantages of being proficient in one of the most widely spoken languages in the world today.  We were concerned initially whether our child would feel overwhelmed being thrown into a new environment with a new language. However, young children adapt quickly and before we knew it, he started acquiring new vocabulary and was responsive when I communicated with him in Mandarin.  Since he started attending school at MindChamps Chinese PreSchool @ Thomson, he learned many words, both in Mandarin and English. He can converse with a basic level of understanding and enjoys the songs and stories in both languages. I'm very much satisfied with the learning we got from MindChamps., MindChamps guarantees  Quality Preschool Education that my child deserves. At the age of 4, he can speak fluently all because his teacher is so dedicated to let my child learn without pressuring him to do so. Play is also a part of their curriculum and I am happy that my child is having best childhood memories at MindChamps., The Office Was So Beautiful In The Inside!ü•∞üòò ‚Ä¶",0.1942081665201966,3,"['child', 'teacher', 'school', 'parent', 'mindchamps', 'preschool', 'learn', 'thomson', 'management', 'time', 'year', 'owner', 'good', 'chinese', 'provide', 'concert', 'mandarin', 'franchise', 'daughter', 'language']",MindChamps Chinese PreSchool @ Thomson

A good foundation for kids., Great curriculum and caring teachers! Regular updates provided and most importantly my child is happy ! Thank you MindChamps Fusionopolis !, Great school with good facilities. My kids had learnt alot during their time there., Good school near my office. Teachers are warm and kind, not to mention who but the teachers in this school does not deserve the price we pay for. When my child was in N1 ,my child peed on his pants while sleeping ( the school said that must let the students learn how to sleep without diaper ) and sleeps in the aircon room fro two hours. May i ask what for training them and letting them fall sick at such a young age ? When he go to N2 , he was scolded again for that once peeing on his pants and he was gloomy for the rest of the day and did not participate in any activities , the teacher also did not care and just let him stand at aside , excuse me ? aren't you suppose to encourage him ? Plus can teachers not point finger at students ? it is rude . thank you, Dedicated teachers and great curriculum!",0.3417701863354036,0,"['teacher', 'child', 'school', 'kid', 'sleep', 'let', 'good', 'great', 'pee', 'pant', 'student', 'learn', 'curriculum', 'care', 'thank', 'happy', 'dedicated', 'age', 'team', 'activity']",MindChamps PreSchool @ Fusionopolis
"Amazing teachers with so much heart and caring mindset. It's wonderful seeing our daughter get excited to go to mindchamp. The teachers really make an effort to engage the kids and develop them in an individualised way. The school is committed to providing a safe, fun and loving environment and we are thankful to Shermaine(principal), Ms Cammy and Han Lao Shi and of course the rest of the awesome teachers at Paragon Mindchamp. WE do observed the development in our daughter and planning to send our son too. Keep up the good work :-), We are glad to have found such a tight-knit, loving first school for our daughter. She enrolled to PG and settled in quickly, alleviating a lot of our worries as very sticky first time parents.  She speaks of Ms Jac, Yang Laoshi, Ma Laoshi, Ms Shermaine, Ms Fiqah, Ms Nadia and her time at school with a huge grin on her face. Teachers and staff are always very responsive and pleasant in our communications.  She's learned a lot during her short time at MindChamps, and is growing to be an independent young lady. We look forward to the next year!, It‚Äôs been a wonderful experience for us to see our daughter learn, develop herself and bond with the Mindchamp Paragon family. We are truly grateful for all the teachers -Ms Jacq, Ma Laoshi, Yong Laoshi, and more - who have dedicated to our daughter the level of care, love, and attention that we could only wish for. Ms. Jacq‚Äôs leadership throughout has been very strong, and critical to her development. She has been able to build deep bonds with the school, and we are very grateful to everyone! PS. very special thanks to the entire staff for expertly handling all our daughter‚Äôs allergies!, We moved our daughter to Mindchamps Paragon when she was entering N2 due to some unpleasant experience with another Mindchamps branch. We were very sceptical at first, but Ms Shermaine (principal) has shown not only her professionalism and expertise in her field but also her ability to understand each champ character and challenge.  We re very impressed with Ms Cammy and Han Lao Shi for being very attentive, passionate, caring , and firm in the same time to our daughter.  She enjoys going to Mindchamps Paragon and loves her friends and Teachers.  Our daughter enjoys learning and showing tremendous growth on her study and character., Our experience with Mindchamps has been great! Ms Shermaine and the PG teachers (Ms Jac, Yong Laoishi and Ma Laoishi) really care about the champs and are amazing. They are attentive, caring, highly qualified and responsible. They also tailor the learning experience based on the champs need and preferences. Thank you for taking care of our little one! We are grateful and appreciative of everything you do., My twin kids joined the amazing school since K1 when we come back from China. We made decision to let kids in because their professional education experience especially from headmaster Ms. li, Sherlyn and teacher Bingbing. They know how to let kids learn what they need based on a friendly, respectful,and happy relationship.[ÊØîÂøÉ], We deeply appreciate MindChamps as a preschool where our kids learned, had fun, and made friends! The teachers go above and beyond to make sure each and every Champ develops. A big THANK YOU to teachers Leong Laoshi and Kaysee for taking care of our youngest son Quentin this year!, We are so grateful for the love and care teachers have given our toddler in playgroup. She went as a little 18 month old and is now confident , speaking fluently and a little lady. Ms Jaq, Ma Laoshi and YangLaoshi thank you for the love and care you have shown our daughter., Dedicated teachers and wonderful facilities. A great environment for kids to learn and play. My daughter absolutely adores coming to school. I highly recommend this preschool!, Eliza attended Mindchamps Paragon from PG to K2. We witnessed how she achieved many great milestones along her PS Journey and unleashed much of her potential through the all rounded, multi faceted programmes that inspire, educate and empower her as a mindchamp! All Her teachers and the principal Showed great dedication and heart to nurture and groom her! Kudos and continue to shine like diamonds and be an inspiration to all the champs! üíé Gambatte!, Ms. Jac, Yang Lao Shi and Ma Lao Shi have been phenomenal in nurturing and educating my child at kindergarten. Their blend of professionalism, creativity, and cultural inclusivity fosters a love for learning. We've seen remarkable growth in my child's confidence and skills. They're truly exceptional educators and mentors."", Sending my children to MindChamps Paragon is easily one of the best decisions I‚Äôve made as a parent. The school is located in a convenient and accessible location - a plus point if you don‚Äôt have a car. The heart of the preschool is really the teachers. They are passionate, caring, patient and loving, and not once have I had to worry about my children‚Äôs well-being or safety. It is a wonderful, warm and safe haven where children are engaged in a structured but purposeful way. My kids always leave the school smiling and happy, and that to me, is the best testimony of a good preschool., I want to share my experience for the past few months with MindChamps Paragon.  Some background of my son, who is turning five this year. He has been attending an International school in Brunei since he was two and a half years old before returning to Singapore on the 31st of November. The school with huge compounds, three canteens, excellent facilities, and large playgrounds, even just for kindergarten level.  When he was in the international school, he was neutral, neither eager nor enthusiastic about school. During covid lockdown, he didn‚Äôt care whether he would be going to school the next day or not.  After returning, I decided to enroll my son in Mindchamp Paragon. At first, I wasn‚Äôt very optimistic due to the limited area to play compared to the international school in Brunei. But this is what it is when we are in a scarce land city-state.  As I would like my son to master his mandarin better, at home, we are only allowed to converse in mandarin as I would want my son to master at least in his mandarin speaking.  During the enrolment, I specifically emphasized to the Teachers to encourage my son to speak more mandarin to him instead of English.  To my surprise! After the first day of school, my son loves going back to MindChamps Paragon. Every day, even on weekends, without fail, he will ask me if there‚Äôs school tomorrow. He had shown so much interest in going to school that he did not have that enthusiasm in his previous school.  After the first week of attending Mindchamps paragon, he has improved his mandarin speaking.  In the following weeks, my son has shown significant improvements in his eagerness to write and draw, which he has lack of previously.  Besides, the teachers went above and beyond to ensure the children were comfortable and well taken care of. This is the first time I have seen such a high level of dedication by the teachers, especially Fan Laoshi, Ms. Cammy, and Ms. Lee.  After a long absence from lockdown, when school reopens, toddlers will typically take about a week to accept and adjust to new environments and routines. What took my son a week in the previous school, in mindchamps paragon, only one day.  To my surprise, he was eager to go back to school the following day without the first day crying drama or pleading to go home, etc.  It‚Äôs such a pity that we will be relocating again in the coming month. If it weren‚Äôt for relocating, we would be glad to continue with mindchamps paragon as long as the highest level mindchamps provides...  My son and I are going to miss this excellent school!  Thank you so much, teachers, for your dedication and efforts to create a positive learning environment for the children.  Thank You So Much !, Love how this school is a complete balance of learning, exploring and fun! My boys love going to school. Thanks for helping them grow ‚Äúsmarter‚Äù(quote from my son) üòÑ. ‚Ä¶, We truly love this school that my son goes to since he was 2.5 years old. He had a cheerful, caring and wonderful teacher named Miss Azizah in his early years. She played an important role shaping and guiding my son to be who he is today i.e a very positive, confident, smart, kind, loving little man :) He also had a sweet and attentive Chinese teacher named Pei Pei Laoshi, that took extra time to teach him Chinese cause he wasn‚Äôt very good at it. Then later he had Mr Jay who is just as caring and wonderful as his first teacher. Mr Jay is a very generous and kind hearted soul. Have a talk with him and you can see how passionate he is about kids and teaching. I highly recommend this school for the teachers that are the main building blocks for our children‚Äôs future. Do give thanks to them when they have done a great job! We need to give praise and recognition to such awesome teachers!, Our family is new to Singapore. Before we applied to the school, Principal Shermaine is so helpful and willing to answer our questions. I am grateful that the children met so many friendly teachers in Mindchamps Paragon, especially Mr Jay, who takes good care of the children and is enthusiastic about his work. My daughter said he is the best teacher ever! My heartfelt thanks to every teachers in this school., Ms Shermaine is a very responsible and dedicated preschool principal. She puts efforts in understanding every champ‚Äôs habits and behaviours both in school and at home, thus as a parent I feel that communication with Ms Shermaine and the teachers has been a good experience so far. The teachers are also professionals in early childhood education who take care of children with fairness and tender loving care. My daughter is happy to go to school and she likes to share with me what she learned in school every day. Thank you Ms Shermaine and the Teachers!, Mindchamps Paragon has been a safe and nurturing environment for my son since 2019. He will graduate this year and we are sure he will miss all the kind and caring teachers & staff @ Paragon, also his classmates for the last 4 unforgettable years! We are extremely pleased with this investment we have made for his future. The camaraderie forged with the other parents is also invaluable., Both my girls attended Mindchamp @Paragon. One graduated in 2015 and the youngest one graduated in 2022.  Every day when I sent them to school, they are always hopping into the school with a smile. And on non-school days, they would tell me that they missed school. At the end of the day, they are always eager to share with us what they had learnt/ what they did in school. And their sharing sessions are always full of excitement. And all these are signs to tell us how much they had enjoyed their pre-school journey!  Their positive preschool experience will not be made possible without dedicated teachers. I would like to thank the teachers, especially Mr Jay for their patience, constant encouragement, creativity and love for my kids.  Thank you for making a great difference for the children. Because you care for them, you have directed them to trust themselves in all they do and to become all that they dream., My son started his K1 @Mindchamps Paragon. We notice his progress in writing, reading & spelling for both English & Chinese. Mr Jay (K2) and Pei Pei Laoshi (K2) were his teachers that make huge positive impact. The teaching dedication is outstanding. Last but not least, my son also made alot of good friends. We are quite happy to have him at Mindchamps during his pre school years., Our son has been going here since December and I have to say within a couple of weeks of being here he started learning to count, started saying the days of the week and also started to communicate his needs better. The teachers are attentive and really care about toddler overall development. The way they design the curriculum is so impressive and I am so happy that we chose this school for my toddler. The teachers‚Äô frequent communication with the parents about the toddler‚Äôs development is also something we really appreciate. Thank you teachers!, How to begin .. I can honestly say that we ( me and my son ) both miss Mindchamps very much. Liam practically grew up with this preschool since he was before 2 years old. From PG to K1 .. We appreciate the attentiveness that most of the Teachers give to the Champs professionally and the time they took to brief us every single day during pick up time. Some teachers would do the extra miles to attend to champs with special needs and to be able to understand that each house hold is different. Their roles at school were as equally important as mom‚Äôs roles at home, they are giving knowledge and implanting discipline that sometimes parents failed to do at home. We are VERY grateful for the Teachers. I apologize if I missed some names but I honestly hope that it won‚Äôt affect any of their good dedications and caring, from Miss Eunice, Wu Laoshi, Fan Laoshi, Miss Bev, Miss Cam, Ms Cleris, Ms Nadia, Ms Jasmine, Mr Jay .. even the previous Ah Yis who used to work there at PRG. I hope the COMPANY can further notice all of Teachers contributions and dedications to the children, can appreciate and care for the Teachers as well, since they play the most important roles in the school ( brand ) development and champs qualities. Nevertheless, we are thankful., My kid has been attending classes at Mindchamps for the past one year and I have been really impressed with the school! The entire experience has been positive - from the student-teacher ratios, to the attentiveness of the staff and also the school‚Äôs thoughtful approach in managing safety - everything has been top notch. I‚Äôll be sending my younger kid here for sure! Keep up the good work., Both of my girls went to mindchamps preschool paragon at 18 mth old. Apart from the comprehensive academic curriculum and the clean, neat, safe environment, the teachers we have encountered were amazingly patient, committed and caring. I must say I was totally worry-free when my girls were left to the care of the Mindchamps teachers, even during Covid period. A special thanks to my second daughter‚Äôs K2 teacher- Mr Jay, for going the extra miles to care for the kids and even arrange play dates for the graduating class during the holidays. Mindchamps Preschool (Paragon), highly recommended üëçüèª, We have nothing but G R A T I T U D E!‚ô•Ô∏è‚ú® Grateful for all the Teachers(Ms Cammy,Fan Laoshi,Mr Jay,Ms Fiqah,Ms Nadia,Ms Jasmine and Miss Shermaine!) Our kid is on remission and it hasn't been easy for us to just leave him in school especially on a full day basis.We thank each and everyone who made Zen's journey an enjoyable one.Since he went to Paragon(coming from Chinese Pre-School at Cecil) he maintains the same level of enthusiasm and he loves his teachers dearly,esp Fan Laoshi and Mr Jay.Thank you for caring for Zen and for always giving us updates on diseases that's been going on in the school.(we are very particular since Zen's immune system is not that strong due to his history.But he's much better now!Fully recovered and enjoying life to the fullest!) Im sure his childhood memory bank is full of happy memories with you all there.üíï  We would also want to commend everyone who taught the kids during their ""I'm Proud of You "" Champs Fest, we can see how confident and comfortable they were on stage even without teachers teaching the steps in front of them.We are also proud of you Teachers of Mindchamps PARAGON!üëèüèªKudos everyone üëèüèªüëèüèªüëèüèªüëèüèªüëèüèª, My kid enjoyed her N1 class but when she got to N2, things changed. She became annoyed and kicked up a fuss for going to school every morning. Caring and nurturing had deteriorated significantly at the N2 class. She was scolded and ridiculed repeatedly for not being able to write proper Chinese characters. My kid left the Paragon school and now attends another preschool. The change was so drastic. She now looks forward to having school days.  The quality of teachers was not consistent. It was good at N1 but became inferior at N2. The moment your kid consistently dreads about going to school, you know something isn‚Äôt quite right., I can still remember the time when I was trying to find the best preschool in Singapore for my then two-year-old boy. I visited a few schools, but none could beat the ‚ÄúThis is the right one‚Äù feel of MindChamps PreSchool at Paragon. The school was brimming with positivity and light. Children wore big smiles on their faces, greeting their friends, teachers and even schoolmates‚Äô parents; teachers were warm and energetic, and the ambience was bright and colourful. They had me at ‚Äòhello‚Äô.  Within a year in MindChamps, he is not only speaking in full sentences but spewing out bombastic words that I‚Äôve never heard of in my life. When asked what he likes best about his school, his response is, ‚ÄúMy friends and teachers‚Äù. I think he doesn‚Äôt know how to say it yet, but I believe it‚Äôs more than just these two fundamental reasons for him liking school. I think to him, schooling in MindChamps is like an adventure or a journey to exciting discoveries. My husband and I too, are very fond of MindChamps. We have witnessed the great exercise of care and diligence to our child and other children. And we can never be too proud of our son's achievements thus far., My girl looks forward for school, learns well and has a great time with friends and teachers, MindChamps at Paragon was a great help to me two weeks ago. My partner and I need to attend some important matter in our work and business. No one will look after our 5 year old son. I remember that MindChamps offers Child Minding Service. Even if I am worried that he might have tantrums while on the center,  We drop him off. When we returned to fetch him around 3:00 P.M., we were amazed that he did not cry at all. He enjoy the activities while we are away plus he have a complimentary book. Thanks, MindChamps!, Great school with attentive teachers who brings passion and compassion to teach the children, Very lovely and kid‚Äôs friendly learning environment., My son has been there for several years. He has been enjoying the time there., Kids are well treated here , teachers young and energetic, Mr. J and Fan Lao Shi is the best teacher, teachers are very warm and considerate, Nice education, teachers and staff!!, The teachers at mindchamps are very friendly and caring.

I have no regrets in sending them to this school and will be forever grateful for this wonderful learning environment that this school has provided for my children., Its been at least 5 years with all 3 of my children attending (& attended!) MindChamps @Kinex. Grateful to have them grow and learn in a safe space with a holistic curriculum, a comfortable learning environment  and more importantly teachers who genuinely care about their progress and well-being with regular communication and support for parents in my parenting journey.  Thank you MIndChamps @kinex!, Teachers and other staff are just lovely, caring and welcoming to kids. This helps to create a positive environment. Ms Yeo knows all the student by their name, and she greets the parents and students with a smile every morning. This shows how they build relationships with students, even my second daughter, who started school one month ago now she is comfortable with her too.  We are glad to choose Mindchamps preschool at East Coast. My two girls, one in PG and another one in N2 now. Teachers (Ms Neesha, Ms Yin and Ms Mae) and the other staff are very affectionate towards the kids ,which makes learning easy and fun.  The principal also pays personal attention to every detail and attends to parents need , which is worth appreciation., Our 2 kids started attending MC at 18 months. 7 years have passed in the blink of an eye. It has been great having MC partner with us in this journey! MC excels in many areas, such as a holistic approach of balancing academic learning and inculcating a love for learning through fun and varied activities, working with us (including connecting fortnightly despite their busy schedule) to correct bad behaviour in school and at home, and most importantly, the Teachers make all the difference! The Teachers can be both firm and fun-loving (depending on what the occasion calls for). The kids love their Teachers! Bearing testament to this was how the children spontaneously hugged their teacher as she ushered them down the stage at the year-end concert! We have  peace of mind when sending the kids to preschool every morning, knowing they are in good hands! Kudos to the MC team!  If there is an ask, it would be lovely to restart the ‚Äúone-night-sleepover‚Äù program ( üôã‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è for me-time!) üòâ, Dear beloved teachers and classmatesÔºå I am regret to say that this Thursday will be Yuwen‚Äòs last day at Minchamps family. On behalf of herÔºåI would like to take this moment to reflect upon the incredible journey she has shared togetherÔºå4 years at Mindchamps has been nothing short of magicalÔºåshaping her earliest memories and setting the foundation for her educational journey. The guidanceÔºåpatienceÔºåand unwavering support have played an instrumental role in her growth. Your creative teaching methodsÔºåwarm smiles and encouragement  will be etched in her heart. You‚Äôve not only taught her lessons from books but also lessons about kindnessÔºårespect and the journey of expiration. To her dear classmatesÔºåeach of you has been a source of joy and inspiration. From shared laughter and adventuresÔºåyou‚Äòve made her everyday at school unforgettable. The bonds you have formed are specialÔºåand I am grateful for the friendship that have taken root during your time together. I want to express my heartfelt gratitude to all of you. The memories created will always be cherishedÔºåand the lessons learned will continue to guide her. Thank you for being an exceptional mentorÔºåand thank you her wonderful classmatesÔºåfor being the best companions anyone could ask for. With sincere gratitude and fondest memories., My daughter has been attending mindchamps for 4 years since PG and I‚Äôd like to thank all staff, teachers and the principal for everything. My daughter has become more independent and also developed a keen interest in reading and writing. I couldn‚Äôt be more pleased with all the recent developments., Highly recommend Mindchamps Kinex. Mrs Koh, Ms Christina and their team of teachers are very professional and committed to delivering the best for the kids. The school provides regular updates on my kids, both academically and on any behaviours / habits, which is something that I really appreciate. My K2 son's reading and writing abilities has improved tremendously within a short period of time and I would like to thank Ms Camille for that. He has also taken an interest in Legos which I believe is due to the exposure he has in school. My PG daughter was able to settle down in school quickly with the help of Ms Neesha and Xu Laoshi, who have their ways to handle the little ones. On top of that, the school has many activities arranged for the children, and my kids look forward to go school everyday. You should definitely consider Mindchamps Kinex if you are looking for a quality preschool., A wonderful preschool with caring and loving teachers. Been a parent/patron for the past 4 years. Great system and procedures in place. Would strongly recommend!, MC Kinex has done a fabulous job in equipping my children with the foundation and lifelong skills they need to embark on their educational journey. It has been very satisfying to experience having to coax my children to go to school to them eagerly awaiting the start of the new school week.  Watching how my eldest was able to transition seamlessly from kindergarten to primary school proves that the decision to send my children to mc kinex was the right one and is a testament to the dedication and professionalism of all the staff there., Our child is currently with the Mindchamps for 9 months already. So far, we have been very happy with our preschool decision.  We only have one child, and she is very active. As such, we are often anxious and always skeptical, if any school can guide her well. The Teachers have been very kind and supportive. We can always see improvements in her languages, behavior and social attitudes. She often gives us surprises, for example, keeps her own toys, asked for permissions to do certain things, know how to be kind or apologize when something goes wrong, speak proper sentences, able to share her toys and food‚Ä¶ etc  On top of that, the school activities also help her to further develop the mind, writing her very first alphabet and initiate to sit at one corner to flip the books and using her little fingers to go through all the sentences. We did not imagine our active child who just turned 3-year-old, is capable to do all these by herself.  We look forward for more of her good character being build up in this school.  We would like to thank all the teachers for your patience, effort and also your unconditional love and care for her., We‚Äôve been with MindChamps Kinex for 5.5 years. The principal and teachers have been very helpful and sensitive to my children‚Äôs needs, and have gone beyond their duties to groom and nurture them. The principal and teachers also guided my husband and I on methods we could use at home to encourage positive behaviors. My eldest have matured emotionally over the years, and this wouldn‚Äôt have been so without the help and support from the team at MC Kinex! Thank you! ‚ù§Ô∏è, I would definitely recommend MindChamps Kinex to families and friends with kids. The principal and team are very professional and hands on with the kids. My little one started school with them when she turned 18months.  Ms Christina, Ms Neesha and Xu lao Shi did a fabulous job in easing the little one into school. My wife and I get daily updates on the progression and photos of the little one via the school‚Äôs app.  The working relationship between parents and Teachers aren‚Äôt limited to school issues, the team of Teachers also check in with parents on the child‚Äôs behaviour and habits at home. This enables the team of teachers to better understand the little one. The Teachers also share with parents what is taught and enforced in school such that parents can try doing so at home.  Mindchamp Kinex has many activities and hands on learning opportunities for the kids. We are happy to see the development and improvement of our little one given that she only started school for 3 months.  Thank you very much to the principal and Teachers for guiding and teaching our little one. We were fortunate to have enrolled her into mindchamp Kinex., As a new mother, I was apprehensive about sending my son to school. At 18 months, he‚Äôs a bit rowdy and not less than what I would consider obedient.  Wasn‚Äôt sure how the schools, especially the teachers would be able to handle him.  Coming close to 6 months now, I am very happy with the experience in MindCamps @ OneKM.  The teachers there are very good with kids and have consistent technique to manage various situations.  Management is also responsive and patient to adddress our concerns.  Overall, happy to see my son learning and enjoying himself in school., I highly recommend MC at Kinex, where my two sons have been attending for about a year. Having had bad experience at two other private preschools before this, my family and I are relieved to finally find a preschool that my boys enjoy attending while we are at work.  Under the strong leadership of Mrs Koh, the team of teachers work together with great synergy and a common vision. As such, the ‚Äúattrition rate‚Äù among teachers seems to be pretty low compared to other schools we have been to. The teachers are passionate, patient, caring, yet firm. We are grateful to all the teachers who spent much effort keeping the children safe (during covid19) and helped the boys to progress in their development. Special mention to Ms Hidayah and Hui Laoshi who went over and above their duties in guiding my boys. Thank you!, We are so lucky to have found MindChamps@one km. Dedicated teachers who not only take care of my girls and correct bad behaviors, but also genuinely have fun with them in the process. I like that the teachers are transparent and always welcome parents into school. My kids are comfortable with any of the teachers, not just with their own class teachers. Turnover ratio of the teachers is also low. Plenty of events and excursions in one year with a sleepover during children‚Äòs day. I‚Äôm not endorsing the MindChamps brand, just endorsing the team behind this particular preschool., We were strongly recommended by our good friend to send our 2 year old toddler to Mindchamps PreSchool @ KINEX (East Coast). Our friend has 3 kids herself and they all attended Mindchamps PreSchool @ KINEX (East Coast) too. She told us that Mindchamps PreSchool @ KINEX (East Coast)stood out from all other preschools due to the dedicated teachers who have been with the centre and school principal for many years. Indeed the PG Teachers have been very caring, patient and attentive towards my son and his classmates.  Personally, it was not a easy decision to send our very young son to a preschool in the first place. After all, he will be spending many hours in the preschool and it will definitely have an impact on his behaviour and development. Luckily, a high quality preschool like Mindchamps PreSchool @ KINEX (East Coast) have brought about positive outcome for my son. My son is a well-adjusted child who enjoys going to school and likes spending time with his Teachers and friends. Thank you Mindchamps Teachers for looking out for my son KJ! Really appreciate it!, I sent my daughter to MindChamps Kinex when she was just starting K1. Prior to MindChamps Kinex, my daughter was attending another childcare centre for her N1 & N2 years. The teachers were very patient and understanding. They helped my daughter to transit into a different environment with ease. She used to dislike going to school but ever since attending MindChamps Kinex, she looks forward to her lessons every day. On top of that, there were huge improvements in her academically. She can read and write very well. Her Mandarin improved tremendously too. Lastly, the teachers are very prompt in their communication and the centre, helmed by Mrs Koh,  is very orderly and well organised. I am most impressed with the well thought out curriculum and its efficient delivery method during the Circuit Breaker period. All in all, I highly recommend MindChamps Kinex to all parents!, My child has been in this school since PG. All the staff and teachers have been great. We always felt comforted knowing our child is in good hands. Teachers are caring and communicate to us regularly regarding our child's progress. A big thank you to everyone at  Mindchamps Preschool@East Coast., Started my boys at kinex mindschamp since 2019. Amazing experience with caring and effortful teachers and staff. Special shout out to Ms Camille and Feng Lao shi and ms yeo! Very personable and staff cares alot for each child. Strongly recommend!, My Child experience was good in past few years. Teachers are very caring, lovely and patient. Hope will continue in the future., Great teachers at MindChamps PreSchool @KINEX- professional and pleasant.  My child has been with them since PG, and with continued encouragement from Mrs Koh, his principal, I have seen positive emotional growth in him over the years.  Not only has he blossomed in terms of his confidence, the way he interacts with his friends, also being able to express himself. Highly recommended school!, First class teachers and management team. Lauren progression went beyond our expectations within a short span of 2 years. She absolutely loves school now. Also communication is great as the parents are always updated. Besides in house learning, lots of outdoor activities to keep the kids constantly engaged. A peace of mind when your kids are with MindChamps. Thanks you!, Our 2 kids have been with MindChamps East Coast since they were 18 months old. As with most other kids, the first few months were very stressful as the kids were wailing and crying when we send them to school. The teachers and principal handled the situation well and we were informed constantly of our kids‚Äô progress and also discussion were held to evaluate how we can best overcome the kids‚Äô reluctance to go to school. We appreciate the attention that has been given to our kids and applaud the dedication that team of teachers has demonstrated that is led by Mrs Koh., Think no more if you are considering MindChamps East Coast to enroll your child. Both my children are attending this preschool and I have absolutely nothing to complain about. Teachers are attentive and prompt to update, low turnover rate and care for the children with big hearts. I go to work with peace of mind knowing my children are well taken care of by this stellar team., I love this PreSchool. Teachers are experienced, friendly, committed and very innovative! The outdoor playground is great and even better when it gets converted to water play at times! My son is outspoken and academically well. The teachers have taught him well. He learns responsibilities, manners and patience. Most of all, he is happy and loves attending school!, Wonderful preschool! My first child has spent 3 year here since we moved to Singapore. He is still missing the preschool and teachers although he is in primary school now. Teachers are experienced and patient. They not only took good care of my child, but also got him well prepared for his next journey in primary school. We will send our second baby to this school soon. I would like to say THANK YOU to the principle and teachers for their great efforts and excellent job!, I would highly recommend Mindchamps Kinex to any potential parents looking for a holistic preschool for your child. The outdoor play area is great for the kids to get some sun and run around. The teachers are kind and caring. The principal helms the centre efficiently and is friendly yet professional with parents. What I especially like is that Mrs Koh emphasises on the importance of discipline and having good moral values and not just on academics.  The teachers did a great job during the circuit breaker and went above and beyond their call of duty to ensure the charges under their care were still learning from home and having fun. The mgmt has taken many steps to ensure the children are safe and happy in school given the current constraints. Kudos to the team at Kinex!, Thank you to the teachers in Mindchamps @ One KM. I noticed that my child, Leanne has improved so much when it comes to her learning. I know her achievements today are because of your dedication and passion. Really appreciate that the teachers actually take time to speak to me regarding Leanne's ability to focus in class (glad that it is better now), correcting bad behaviours and picking up on little things that we as parents do not notice at home. I love how the teachers always come up with ideas for school activities, excursions and bringing the children out for musicals and plays. Of course, not forgetting the signature sleepover event... Thank you so much for partnering us in nurturing the child‚Äôs future! It feels good to know that my child is learning and growing in an environment like this, It is my second year here, but I have witnessed the teachers' dedication and love in teaching the children. Thank you and may you continue the good work!, We love this PreSchool. Both my children are here from PG to K2 and never once do we have to worry if they would be mistreated or whatsoever at school because the teachers here are experienced and delicated. The outdoor playground is huge and there is water play from time to time. Both my children started off shy and reserved but the teachers managed to help them build up their confidence till they moved on to Primary school as confident individuals. We are so grateful to the teachers here who helped us mound their character so well. They learnt responsibilities, to care and to share. Most importantly, both built up a deep love for attending school, they both were happy and loves attending MindChamps to the extent that they just wish they can turn back time and stay on as babies. Thank you, MindChamps East Coast (OneKm - Kinex)., Both my kids are with mindchamps@onekm. What makes the school special is that it has a strong sense of family. The bigger kids would help the little ones and they have friends across levels. The main teachers are also with the school for a long time. Been with the school for the past 5 years, we have become friends with the teachers and some of them taught both my kids. The kids are not only well prepared for p1, they are also exposed to current affairs and values (eg. The recent Thai cave incident was discussed in class). Thank you teachers for all the efforts and going the extra mile to create special moments for the kids!, Our children (K2 and N1) are with Mindchamps Preschool @OneKM, or Kinexis, both started at 1.5yrs. They loved every bit of it and looked forward to school every morning, as they never complained about having to attend school. We've seen how well they progressed over the years and we are very pleased to have made this wise choice. We'd highly recommend Mindchamps Preschool to parents who prefer a more holistic approach to teaching and learning. This is particularly important to nurture lifelong interest in learning and to help my children cope with the world ahead of them. Besides, we are also happy with the activities-filled curiculum, perhaps that is the reason why our kids were often entusiatics learning new things. The teachers are always helpful, patient, kind and cheerful, which never failed to amaze us with their passion and dedication to their job. Kudos to the Principal Mrs Koh who did a fantastic job! Definitely a big thumbs up for them and should no.3 come along, we wouldn't hesitate but stick to Mindchamps! If there is only one thing to ask: please stay affordable... üòÅ, My two kids each had 4 good years of care and education at the preschool. It first started out in a little homely corner along East Coast Road with a great team of teachers. The principal Mrs Koh is always jovial and full of energy. There are many fun events with the support of the teachers and PSG. The teachers are also attentive to the needs of the kids. Thank you for the great memories!, We enrolled our son with Mindchamps Kinex during the circuit breaker through a friend‚Äôs recommendation and we never looked back. We were apprehensive initially because of the timing that we enrolled our son, but that quickly dissipated. The school took social distancing and personal hygiene very seriously, requiring the children to wash their hands frequently. They even specially sourced a face shield for them. Pre-covid days, the parents were able to sit in with their child during the first week of school for a smooth transition.  This was something we couldn‚Äôt do. Rachel understood our anxieties and for the first week, she attached Miss Pearlyn with our son to slowly warm him up to the environment and they gave us constant updates to assure us.  Rachel and her whole team of teachers are very loving, passionate, dedicated and nurturing. Every single teacher regardless of the level that they were in charged of, were familiar with every child in Kinex from PG to K2. The feeling they gave us was that the entire school was one big happy family. All the teachers there have been teaching there for a considerable number of years. Attrition rate is low and they have a great seamless system and clockwork going on. This has to be attributed to Rachel‚Äôs strong leadership.  No child or parent gets left behind. They were there every step of the way with us right from the start, responding to our many queries, allaying our fears and making sure our child and every child gets to fulfill their best potential in their time. They were there to encourage them when needed, yet being firm with him and rewarding him when he does something positive.  Besides focusing on the curriculum, Rachel and the teachers also made sure the childrens‚Äô social skills and inculcation of values were not missed out on either. Those to us were more important than the curriculum itself.  We did not have to worry one bit putting our son with Mindchamps Kinex whilst working. We know that he was in the best hands.  It was very sad and heartbreaking that we had to leave kinex for another branch because we relocated to the other end of the island. We have Rachel and her stellar team to thank for setting such a good foundation in our child that he transited well in the new school.  I cannot thank especially Rachel, Miss Neesha, Miss Anna, Miss Pearlyn, feng lao shi, Miss Camille enough. Thank you all girls for all the heart work that you do. ‚ù§Ô∏è, Thanks to the amazing team of teachers who put in efforts to create a safe and nurturing environment for the children to grow and develop in. My daughter has enjoyed her lessons and loves her teachers here so far., We signed up with them since PG and have not looked back since. They are dedicated and caring, yet strict in reinforcing rules and correcting proper behaviours. The school is very clean and we have not had any major episodes of viruses (touch wood) so far. My two kids enjoy going to school everyday and we appreciate MindChamps in preparing our kids for their primary school journey., Our little one has been with MindChamps @ OneKm (East Coast) for the past 4.5yrs (PG to K2) and we were glad we made such an excellent choice. We had heard so much about how good the principal and teachers were at Mindchamp (East Coast), now at OneKm even before we sent our kid there and decided to check the school out. Not only did the preschool left a good and deep first impression on my husband and I; the holistic and safe environment backed by the team of dedicated teachers was what we deeply appreciate throughout the years.  Ethan Choo would not have come this far and transit so smoothly into his Primary 1 if it had not been for the love and guidance from his teachers. You have our heartfelt thanks, Mindchamps @ OneKm (East Coast)!, Started with MindChamps East Coast in 2012 for my eldest girl. And now into 3rd year for my younger son. The school is well managed with very low attrition rate. Teachers are experienced and prompt at addressing parents concerns. Students are well nurtured with empowerment and leadership. I‚Äôm glad that i picked MC East Coast. Look no further if you want a school with high quality care served by this dedicated team., My son was enrolled into mindchamp for 4 years. The teachers are very dedicated and provide regular feedback on the child's behaviour, interaction with friends, performance etc. The curriculum includes gourmet, gym, phonics etc. Which makes learning fun and engaging for the kids. Strongly recommended., 5 years ago, I was a 1st time parent looking for a preschool for my 1st child. Had walked into Mindchamps East Coast randomly and was blown away by what I see as compared to other centers I visited. There was no turning back since then. Teachers are sincere and whenever I have issues with my kids ( both academic and behavior) I will not hesitate to discuss it with the teachers. They will give advice and also reiterate the same to the children in school. 2nd child is now in the same school and I know he is in good hands. Thank you MC East Coast!, We visited more than a handful of preschools in 2014 when we were looking for one to send our daughter to. Definitely a no brainer amongst those we visited! 2 years later and it was time for us to send our younger son and again a no brainer! Excellent team of core teachers and principal who gives feedback both for academic and non academic, wanting the best for the Champs both at home and in school! Our daughter is graduating this year and she has already mentioned that we will miss all her friends and teachers!! ‚ô•Ô∏è Thank you teachers for your love!, A caring and dependable team of teachers from Mindchamps Preschool (@Kinex)! The principal is always on the go, responsive to our queries and helpful. I really appreciate the help, support and cooperation by the team all these years, since my boy enrolled for PG in 2017. Will strongly recommend this preschool to my friends & colleagues!, We highly recommend MindChamps @East Coast. Mrs Koh is a very capable principal and with her leadership and a group of dedicated teachers, we feel our daughter is in good hands. We feel the staff are highly organized and understand every aspects of the children in great details. - N2 Jiang Yutong's Dad, My boy is with mindchamp east coast since PG. The school has a team of dedicated teachers with low turnover, led by Mrs Koh, the same principal since enrollment. I feel assured to leave my boy in this child care and knew that he is in good hands and strict discipline. Teachers also provide regular feedback to parents via the App and face to face meetups., I transferred my girl from Mindchamps CBP to Mindchamps East Coast when we moved house 2 years ago. Both Mindchamps are good because of several factors of importance in my consideration: 1. Staffing -  Principal, Teacher with low attrition and change. And Professional in communication and the program plan (English proficiency eg. grammar, Chinese proficiency eg. For engaging children with little interaction with Chinese at home) 2. Safe Environment - how they handle misbehaviour, cleaning and sanitisation, and separate bathroom for boys and girls to protect their modesty from young. 3. Holistic education - Not just academic focused but overall exposure to different learnings at their young age (eg. Gym class, confidence in speaking in front of peers, simple cookery class, artwork, playtime in playground, music etc) 4. No homework for parents except for K2 (spelling only). U can tiger on weekends if that's what you need but not for me. I am particularly happy with Mindchamps East Coast as I can entrust my children with very caring teachers and principal in this branch., Attentive and professional teachers who care for the children. Always prompt to update me on happenings regarding my two year old boy and sharing tips on how to better his development. School even gave me a handwritten note to congratulate us for a newborn baby girl. Very good staff and management (not to mention the comprehensive syllabus), hence highly recommended, I have never regretted leaving my two kids in the good hands of the team of teachers  at Mindchamps at One KM(Kinex mall). They have on many occasions gone out of their way to help my kids adjust to each phase of their development - be it toilet training, overcoming their fear of a dark Theater or even ensuring that my Son does not come into contact with certain foods he is allergic to. Thank you Teachers!, Placing my child at a Mindchamps One KM is the best thing that I ever did . Mrs Koh the principal is very conscientious and she goes all the way out for the children and parents . My respect and kudos to her . Also appreciate all the Teachers for their patience and genuine love for my child. As he is slow, but the Teachers are ever so encouraging and a good impetus to improvements in his life., Teachers are kind and patient with my little one ‚ù§Ô∏è good open lines of communication and we trust them., Would highly recommend Kinex Mindchamps. Mrs Koh & teachers are very dedicated,attentive and good people who can teach,guide and prepare young kids for their next stage. Really thankful for their efforts. And will definitely sign up for my coming newborn as well., Would highly recommend MindChamps PreSchool (East Coast) @Kinex to all parents! Both the principal and teachers there are capable, committed and caring. My husband and I feel assured leaving our kids in their care and had never once regretted our choice!, Good school and environment. Teachers are attentive and caring. Thank you to Ms Christina Ms Camille Zhao Laoshi, Ms Yeo, Mrs Koh and all the lovely teachers, My son joined Mindchamps just last year. In less than one year I find a big positive change in him. He was a very shy kid, now he talks openly even challenges me some times. He had shown a big leap in academics as well. Thanls a lot to the teachers.., Would definitely and highly recommend Mindchamps@1km to all parents out there. Both my kids started with them since PG. The Principal and Teachers are highly reliable, caring and I have absolute trust leaving my children in their care. Thank you all! :), Teachers are very professional and very responsive. My boy couldn't really understand not could he speak any English when we first put him to Mindchamp Onekm. Now after 2 years, he could speak good English and sometimes could even correct us if we said anything wrong. Environment wise I personally like it a lot compared to other pre-schools as it is clean and comfortable. Highly recommended!, My daughter has been in Mindchamps since she is 20 month-old (in 2014) from when they were at East Coast to the new premise at oneKM. They have an awesome team that is dedicated and provide really quality care. As a working mother, it puts me at ease knowing she is in good hands., Am impressed by how much my 2 year old has learnt since starting school 6 months ago. Constant updates from teachers on his progress and behaviour. All the children in the school all seem happy and seem to enjoy school so much. Thank you teachers and staff of MindChamps for the hard work!, Always prompt to update me on happenings regarding my daughter and sharing tips on how to better her development.  A peace of mind when your kids are with MindChamps. Recommended! Two thumbs up!, Excellent core team of Principal and teachers. Both my kids are there from PG. One will be graduating this year, no preschool is perfect but this one ranks as one of the better ones around. Keep up the good work!, My daughter has been with them for over two years. She has enjoyed it a lot. Teachers are very responsible and caring for her. I would recommend this school to anyone that is looking for a good preschool for their kid., A team of experienced and dedicated teachers. I have seen the improvement in my girl since she entered Mindchamps preschool @ onekm. We love the School's curriculum too!, Teachers there take great pride in their work! Have no regrets signing up my kid in this particular school., Good learning environment and teachers.. recommend üëç ‚Ä¶, Centre has relocated to Kinex shopping mall at Paya Lebar MRT, premises is clean,  and curriculum is well paced and structured, A caring and responsible preschool, We came to Singapore from China and have been attending kindergarten in Majors on the East Coast for a year. Compared with the previous school, we can see many differences. The teachers here have a strong sense of responsibility and communicate quickly with parents. Every time the teacher finds something that needs improvement in the child, he will communicate with us in a timely manner and give us good advice. As a parent, I enjoy seeing the changes and growth in my children this year. The most important thing is that the child is happy than anything else!, Thanks to the management team and teachers of MindChamps@east coast. Under your careful care and guidance, Yutong quickly adapted to school life and looks forward to going to school every day. The school's awareness and enforcement of safety and hygiene measures effectively ensure that children can learn and play in a safe environment. In addition, the school teachers‚Äô cultivation and attention to good behavior among children allowed me to hand over my baby to the teacher with great peace of mind. As a mother, I feel confident that my children will be properly cared for at MindChamps@east coast. As a mother of two children, when my second baby grows up, I will still choose MindChamps!  Feng Lin N2 Jiang Yutong‚Äôs mother, The teachers at the school are very serious and responsible. We are from China and our English is not very good. The teachers arrange for the children to have contact with English-speaking children and teach them to have strong self-care skills. The teachers can also communicate in a timely manner about the children's situation at school. In the school The environment is also very good. Overall, I am very satisfied., We are from a Chinese family and we rarely use Chinese at home. However, since Wang Guangxi came to school, he can now speak a lot of English. As long as he can speak, he chooses to speak in English. The teacher will teach him in different ways and is very patient. Thank you.",0.27027488504142866,0,"['teacher', 'school', 'child', 'mindchamps', 'kid', 'year', 'good', 'preschool', 'thank', 'kinex', 'team', 'parent', 'care', 'coast', 'principal', 'east', 'recommend', 'love', 'environment', 'son']",MindChamps PreSchool @ East Coast
"Both of our kids go to Mindchamps ORP and we could not recommend more. We looked at many other preschools including Mindchamps other branches as we move home but ORP sets the bar so high that we simply cannot find another place that we could feel the same sense of belongings and peach of mind as here. There are teachers coming to school to get their pay check which is totally understandable; but at ORP we see the genuine love for children. The teachers here bond and put their emotions into the students which make huge difference from doing it simply as a job. Chuang Laoshi, Ms Qiwen, Cheng Laoshi, Mo Laoshi, and Ms Kristine, Pan Laoshi..yes we can name many teachers because teachers in this center know the kids across the center. The love does not stop by the walls of classrooms. Comparing to bigger centers, ORP may not have the first class facilities, may not be the most spacious. But what is more important than these are the people! We have full trust in the teachers here. With Love and Light, Feedback from Nathaniel‚Äôs Parents ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è  Thank you Tr Yati and Chen Laoshi for taking care of Nathaniel and as parents we are indeed very satisfied with his 360 degree development during his N2 class.  We have seen tremendous improvements in his social and emotional development.  His vocabularies and overall speech literacy has improved a lot as well.  We have noticed his confidence level that‚Äôs always on a high after joining MindChamps.  Although he is still weak in his numeracy and letters writing or sentence formation, we do believe with consistency in training him and assuring him on his capabilities, we are sure he will catch up on this soon.  We seek your kind support to our child and we as parents are willing to assist at home in any way we can to help Nathaniel to continuously thrive and be happy in school.  Many Thanks üòä, Ever since he joined ORP mindchamps, our son has made remarkable progress in his fine motor and language skills. He never fails to amaze us with the things he learned in school! The teachers‚Äô regular updates on his development also assure us that he will be able to learn and grow on a safe and caring environment. Thank you to all the PG teachers for making Declan‚Äôs journey so enjoyable and delightful!, Teachers were very kind to my daughter but turnover rate was too high. We seemed to have staff leaving and coming every quarter while we were there.  The operations manager was slow to respond to our emails and also wrongly calculated the ECDA due to us.  Principle is very passive and communicate via emails only. During school events, she remains quiet at the side - sorry if this seems offensive but I had thought she was only an admin staff or support teacher.  Again this review doesn't do the teachers like Mo Lao Shi justice but the other aspects of the center was simply a let down., Inspiring and caring teachers. Spontaneous staff. Mindchamps ORP is a happy preschool.  Special thanks to Ëé´ËÄÅÂ∏à for encouaging and cultivating the 'speaking Mandarin' habit in my daughter which she had issues in the beginning. She has also showed great interests in Chinese language now and would sing ÂÑøÊ≠å happily after school.  She has become an independent and self-directed learner.  Thank you Mindchamps ORP!, I am happy that Mindchamps offers Writing Programme suited for our 7 year-old son. Their programme focuses on the understanding and creative aspects of writing which makes it more fun and interesting for him. The activities are designed to complement the MOE Curriculum which make me think that my child is in good hands. Thank you MindChamps for creating useful programmes like this one., Hi,  During this 2020, my daughter has show improvements, especially in the second year.   I can observe tremendous progress in English & Chinese writing & reading.  Greatly appreciate and my heartily thanks to teacher Siti and teacher Song for their extraordinary efforts.  Good work.  Best regards, Richard Fung, My daughter has shown great improvements in her reading and writing.

"My son has been in MindChamps since he was 20 months old but transferred to MindChamps Sengkang in June 2023 when he was in N2 because he didn't seem to enjoy his last centre as much as I had hoped he would. Transferring him here was the best decision I've ever made. The teachers in this school are outstanding in every way - they are a truly passionate, nurturing group of educators who love what they do and the children that they teach. And this love is quite evidently reciprocated by the students, who can't seem to get enough of school! My son longs to return to school even on weekends. Thank you for making school a very happy place to be at, as it should be. :) Shout out to Ms Hepzi, Ji Laoshi, Ms Ross, Mr Jeremy, Ms Anne, Ms Amenda and Ms Sharlene for always being so warm and attentive. If you're looking for a preschool that not only excels in its curriculum but provides a safe, nurturing and genuinely compassionate environment, look no further. The champs in this school are a happy troop who are always so polite, thoughtful and pleasant in their mannerisms - a testament to the quality education they receive here. :), My kid is usually slow to warm up in schools. He appeared very comfortable with the teachers and school in just 3 weeks. The things he learnt is in 6months is way much more than the 7 months he was in the previous school. I believe that school is not just about phonics, language, math and words, but also about knowledge around the world. He often comes back sharing about what he learns and some happenings in school. This is something which was not observed in previous schools.  All these attribute to the committed teachers. They genuinely want to know more about the kid and make the effort to engage the kids. The support and nurturing environment is definitely one of the factors that allow him to open up faster.  They help the kids to excel further in their strengths while encouraging them to work on their weaknesses. The curriculum in the school emphasises all aspects of development. The kids also get some exposure to performances that helps to build up their confidence.  I love the open communication with the teachers. The teachers are very approachable and we do get regular updates about their progress in school.  No regrets in sending my kid to the school. Highly recommended!, Xochitl started the mindchamp‚Äôs in June 2023. Since then, we have noticed positive changes from our daughter. She used to be slightly introverted and have since gained much more confidence in group settings. From being reluctant to turn up for school, she is now excited about learning new things and through positive reinforcement from her Teachers, she gained a newfound interest academically. Xochitl form teacher Ms Lydia is a very helpful and kind teacher‚ù§Ô∏è,Meng Yao Lao Shi also trying her very best to let my daughter interest in her Chinese.  Listening to her sing praises about the Teachers makes us feel at ease, along with how our relatives have seen her notable changes, we would want to thank mind champs from the bottom of our hearts. A huge thank you for seeing our daughter through such a crucial stage of her life, nurturing her in a positive way which lays her foundation for her future development.  Thank you! Sincerely, Wei Nan & MichelleI‚Äôm, We enrolled our boy into Mindchamps Sengkang when he was 18 months old. 2 months had past and he had shown significant improvements in his fine motor skills, ability to listen to instructions and gained more confidence in his speech. The engagement and support from staff and teachers is excellent. Aside from updates through the App, face-to-face conversations are genuine and teachers are extremely approachable. Through our observations and communication with the teachers, we can feel that they genuinely love children and want the best for them.  We love the curriculum as well which is pretty comprehensive even for PG level children, where they get to explore the various themes in music, gym, gourmet lessons. It has been an overall positive experience for our family, where we now see our boy showing much more interest in communicating and responding with people. He eats better than before, always wanting to attempt to feed himself. I can‚Äôt wait to see more of such positive changes. Enrolling our boy into Mindchamps Sengkang is the best decision we had ever made for our boy to date. Highly recommend the preschool to other parents!, My boys have been very happy and enjoys school since we transferred them to Mindchamps  in Jun 2023. The teachers are professional, committed and care for the children. No regrets transferring to Mindchamps!, My experience with this preschool has been nothing short of exceptional, and I am beyond grateful for the positive impact it has had on my sons.  When my older son first started at MindChamps, he never spoke a single word of Mandarin. However, with the incredible guidance of his Chinese teacher, Ji Lao Shi, he has opened up to the language in a way that I couldn't have imagined. It's truly remarkable to see how he has progressed and embraced Mandarin under Ji Lao Shi's care and instruction.  One of the things I really love about this school is the extensive exposure it provides to children. My sons have had the opportunity to explore various interests, including learning musical instruments like the violin at such a tender age. They even had the chance to perform at a public venue, and I could see how much they enjoyed the experience. It's heartwarming to witness their enthusiasm for learning and self-expression.  The teachers at MindChamps, especially Ji Lao Shi, Miss Lydia, Miss Chantille, Miss Joy, Li Lao Shi, and Ling Lao Shi, are exceptional. They played a pivotal role in easing both my sons' transition into the school. It's evident that they genuinely care and love my children, which, as a parent, is what matters most to me. The support and nurturing environment they provide make all the difference.  I must also commend the principal, Miss Amenda, for her attentiveness towards parent feedback. It's truly amazing to have a principal who values and listens to parents' opinions and concerns.  Academically and holistically, my sons have shown significant improvement since joining MindChamps Preschool Sengkang. I wholeheartedly recommend this preschool to other parents seeking a nurturing and enriching environment for their children. It's been an incredible journey, and I am excited to see how my sons continue to thrive at this wonderful institution.  Thank you, MindChamps Preschool, for your dedication and commitment to nurturing young minds. We are grateful to be a part of your school community!, In June, we enrolled our daughter at MindChamps, and the transformation we've witnessed in her has been truly remarkable. She now effortlessly manages her daily routines and eagerly looks forward to attending school each day.  One of the aspects we appreciate the most is the thoughtfully designed curriculum. It caters to the holistic development of our child, addressing her social and emotional skills, which we hold in high regard. MindChamps excels in guiding her social behaviors and provides ample opportunities for her to shine in public settings.  Under the leadership of the dynamic Principal, Ms. Amenda, MindChamps has organised community outreach events for the children to participate in. In a short period, our girl has been involved in events such as the ""Grand mall opening ceremony"" and the ""Mid-Autumn Festival performance.""  The teaching staff at MindChamps is truly exceptional. Their dedication and professionalism shine through in every interaction. We would like to express our heartfelt gratitude to Ms. Lydia and Ji laoshi, our daughter's form teachers, for their unwavering patience and timely feedback, which have played a significant role in her growth. We also want to extend our appreciation to Ms. Chantille, our daughter's English program (MRW) teacher, for her guidance and support, which have enabled our girl to read English books fluently at her level.  When it comes to Music, Mr. Jeremy has been a fantastic mentor, and our daughter now enjoys playing the violin and other instruments. Last but not least, a big thank you to Ms. Hepzi, who consistently adds a fun element to Nuro Move. Your contributions to our daughter's overall development are greatly appreciated.  Every day, our daughter discovers something new at this preschool. It's the perfect environment for her to learn, explore, and flourish.  In conclusion, we wholeheartedly recommend MindChamps @ Sengkang to other parents seeking a nurturing and comprehensive early learning experience for their children. It has been a truly rewarding journey for our family, and we are excited about the bright future it is shaping for our daughter., I enrolled my son to MindChamps @ Sengkang and this preschool has exceeded all our expectations! All the teachers and staff are caring and attentive!, MindChamps PreSchool @ Sengkang is a new centre that was opened in April 2023. We enrolled our second boy, Thomas to this new centre from day-1 and he was the first student in his N2 Passion class. Given the short duration of 1.5 months, we already observed fast growth on Thomas through the centre‚Äôs well-designed curriculum and learning system/ process with highly qualified teachers. Initially, Thomas was a bit reluctant to go to school because this is his first pre-school. Now, he enjoys himself very much to go to school every day. Thank you so much to the school principal, teachers and staffs at MindChamps PreSchool @ Sengkang. Special thanks to N2 Passion form teachers, Ms Hepzibah & Ms Ji Kai Li and support from Ms Zhang Ji Xing. Appreciate all effort from everyone and look forward to an excellent learning journey for Thomas., My girl is happy to go to school every day after we transfer her  to MindChamps in sengkang., Extremely good!, In the blink of an eye, my 5-year-old sister has been attending mindchamps@Seng Kang for more than three months. I have become accustomed to watching her rushing into the school gate every day and listening to her happily sharing all kinds of random thoughts after school: We went to the supermarket to buy some food every day. Fruit, I made yogurt after getting up in the afternoon; when I played in the water today, I shared toys with my friends; today a certain classmate gave me a gem (plastic), üà∂Ô∏èthe colors of the rainbow, etc., etc... And these three In the past few months, with the help of the teacher, my sister's independent reading ability in Chinese and English has also been greatly improved. Occasionally, she would make superfluous remarks in the conversation, play the piano to an ox; or take out a Level 4 Oxford tree and relish it in the corner. When reading, the old mother felt really happy. After all, every parent hopes that their children can develop a good habit of independent learning as they grow up, and have a happy and splendid childhood. I would like to sincerely thank Ms. Lydia and Teacher Ji for their careful teachings, allowing my sister to become a better version of herself; thank you to Principal Amenda and all the teachers for creating a happy and friendly atmosphere for the children's growth.

"MindChamps is truly a remarkable learning environment for children. The dedication of their staff to nurturing young minds is evident in every aspect of the preschool. The engaging and creative curriculum they offer helps children develop not only academically, but also socially and emotionally. It's inspiring to see how they create a safe and supportive space where children can explore, learn, and grow., I sent both my children to this preschool. Very positive experience. Nice and friendly environment More importantly the kids seem to enjoy it., Academic wise very strong. When my son graduated, he brought back so many exercise books that I felt amazed. Learned a lot of diverse content including speech and drama, music, gymnastic, etc. Thoughtful and experienced teachers. Clean environments. Good communication too. Overall good experience., I am so grateful that I have found this preschool for my girl. I can see lots of improvement of her after attending the school for almost a year now. I have enrolled her to mindchamps MBC when she was 2 years old and 8 months.  When she just started that time, she didn't really engage and join the activities with her peers and also quite picky on the food. I need to prepare lunch and snack for her to eat at school. The teachers there are very dedicated , caring and patience with her. They spent lots of effort and encourage her to join the activities with her peers and adapt to the school environment and routine.  Now she can eat all the food provided by school and even at home she also not picky with the food anymore. After playing with her toy or read her book, she will put back the toys and books to the place where she took it. I can see a lot of behaviors changes within this period and she is so looking forward to preschool every morning and always return home with her happy and smiley face.  Thanks mindchamps MBC teachers for all the guidance,  love and caring that you have given to my girl. Much appreciated., Mindchamps @ MBC have been great for our girls. We initially chose the location for its convenience, clean environment and great outdoor space. But what we got out of it was a whole lot more from engaged and effective Teachers to very caring and attentive teaching assistants. Our girls enjoyed their years at the preschool tremendously., I have entrusted all my 3 boys to Mindchamp in mapletree. Teachers here are kind, caring and well trained. They know how to engage and teach the children well. My 2 older boys have no issue coping with the primary school transition. Good and clean environment with individual room for each class so K1 and K2 are not distracted by the younger children., MBC's teachers are well trained and they not only utilises the mindchamp app but also provide face to face updates of my son's educational progress.  Their app includes the latest info and progress reports with photos to allow parents to know everything. The food is catered by reputable caterer vendor and guaranteed the champs' health and well being.  the location is impressive. MBC is a grade A building with natural amenities like park, eco pond and allow the champs to walk to nearby mrt station, shopping mall and even supermarket to learn more things and gain more knowledge.  MBC prestige location has grade A security and even has periodic police task force patrolling to ensure the deveopment's safety. there are banks and government agencies occupying the devlopment spaces and hence, the champs can be guaranteed world class safety.  i love my son when he sings ""preschool so much fun"". i know that he has enjoyed himself not only in school, but in a renowed preschool with a world class programme.  if i ever get another kid, mindchamps @ MBC will definately be my first and only choice for my kid., Dedicated teachers and caretakers. Very clean and conducive class and environment. Our children are always looking forward to Preschool with MindChamps. üëçüèª ‚Ä¶, My kid has attended this school for three years.

"My daughter has been in MindChamps Marina since she was in Playgroup. My daughter is now in Nursery 2. I have seen her progression through her way of interpretation about what happens in school. From yoga poses, to counting 1-10 using manipulatives, to teaching us her dance moves, to singing, to pushing me to get her to cook! She proudly talks about her teachers at home. There is never a day that has gone by without talking about her experience in school. Even if I have any concerns, you will see responses even after school hours. I don't have to go through every nitty detail about a school when my child is able to express it as a story each day with facial expressions. MindChamps Marina has been closest to our hearts from day 1 till now., My daughter adores the teachers here! She had a wonderful and enriching experience at MindChamp Marina Square. It's a nurturing, interactive, engaging, and loving environment! We are impressed with her newfound skills in reading, writing, singing, dancing, storytelling, and even playing songs on the keyboard!  A heartfelt thank you to all the teachers for brightening my daughter's childhood!, We enrolled our son starting from K1 and he really enjoys the school curriculums and very good interactions with the teachers.

My daughter loves it, so do we, her parents! We love the positive and nurturing learning environment, and amazing staff with so much passion and heart. When I pick my daughter up from school, she often says, ""Mummy, I love my school!"" And it does matter a lot that she does. :), I have lots of fun today performing for my friends, my family and my teachers! The energy from the children were high. I love Mindchamps! üíéü§¥üë∏ü¶Ñüíñ ‚Ä¶, Good job to the team of teachers for preparing Champs for their year-end showcase!

Responsible and dedicated teachers, kudos to the team!, Love the showcase today and thanks dor the guidance that all teachers have given to my girl:l, My son has improved his cognitive abilities by leaps and bounds. No regrets with MindChamps MSQ, I was at Marina Square gain city doing my shopping when I heard this lady saying she from Mindchamps wanted to but some speakers for her event. She kept pressing the poor salesperson for discount. Hello , lady people also earn a living ok . Some more dare to said so loud for the whole world to know she is from mindchamps . Shame to the school for having such LOW CLASS executive., Mindchamps has been instrumental in nurturing and instilling valuable knowledge to my kids. I never have to worry when my kids are in school and I cannot thank the teachers enough for taking such good care of them. The fact that my boy who has left Mindchamps, still misses his preschool teachers says so much! Thank you to the awesome teachers!, It‚Äôs was amazing n fantastic shows. Great jobs teachers!, Good performance put up by my daughter. Good visual arts showcase., My son just loves going to Mindchamps everyday! At home, he will start talking about his day in school, about his friends, his teachers, about what he learnt and how he's having fun at school. He's now a very expressive kid and not shy to share his views, engaging in talks with adults. Having joined Mindchamps Marina Square since PG, he knows all the teachers and of cos, we do not see much turnover for teachers. In summary, we are so glad to have our son at Mindchamps Marina Square., Performing Arts school enable the champ trained to be confident from young., Excellent workshop. Thank you very much!, As with the old African proverb, ‚ÄúIt takes a village to raise a child‚Äù, MindChamps has been the ‚Äúvillage‚Äù that shaped  our kids during their formative years. The academic foundation at MindChamps has prepared my son well ‚Äì not just with a smooth transition to primary school, but also in tackling new challenges and learning more complex concepts at school. With my daughter, through the close involvement of the teachers in her learning journey, she has grown to be more independent and picked up skills such as reading and math, as well as developed an appreciation for nature, art, play and mindfulness, all at a tender age. The teachers at MindChamps are attentive and caring, and they nurture a love for learning. With a well-balanced learning environment, my children have gained the skills and confidence to take risks, make mistakes, and learn from them. I am confident my children has a great head start in their education and in life!, Great musical performance! Thanks to all the teachers!, The teachers in Mindchamps are awesome. They cares for the children and my son looks forward going to school everyday. Highly recommend Mindchamps at Marina Square., Great music workshop held by mindchamps to help parents appreciate the school‚Äôs music curriculum. Big shoutout to the teachers for the effort!, My boy is enjoying and very happy teachers in MSQ MindChamps‚ù§Ô∏è, Curriculum The MindChamps curriculum and values are unmatched, from day 1 of enrolment, the Mindchamps team addresses your champ by name, and in time to come, my kid addresses each and every one of his subject teacher by name, mutual respect at a young age!  Location One of the rare locations in the city where you can literally drop off your kid at the driveway and walk 5 metres to the school, no need to rush into carparks and basements, drop off and pick up is a 1 minute affair, not to mention the MindChamps team makes the effort to recognise your vehicle so your kid is ready to go the moment you walk up to the door, never had to wait longer than a couple of minutes.  City Campus The centre lacks an inhouse indoor playground but they do make use of Marina square's public playgrounds for the kids to enjoy themselves, a hidden benefit - my kid seldom goes goo-goo over indoor playgrounds anymore as he does it on school time anyway, and getting him to leave one is easy, the school has conditioned him well.  Talk about raising a city kid!  Staff Hospitality I recall the first time we visited the centre in the morning, most of the kids were running into the school, and it's with no surprise, there's always a very warm welcome at the door greeting every kid good morning as they get ready through the health checks before school, so they get all hyped up about school the moment they step through the doors.  Chinese Education There is a dedicated chinese lessons and teacher for every level, for a family that speaks only English at home, my kid picked up a remarkable amount of Chinese words for his age.  Summary A famous chinese proverb goes ""‰∏âÂ≤ÅÂÆöÂÖ´ÂçÅ"", if you're looking for a place for your kid to develop with the right values, principles and literal/motor competency, I'll bet my last nickel with the folks here at Marina MindChamps.  Update: My sister saw the development in my kid and registered both her elder daughter in the Mindspace program and transfered her younger daughter to a Mindchamps near her place, kudos to the MindChamps team!, The curriculum is very fun and interesting. My girl really enjoy the lessons., Very enjoyable performance put up by my grandchildren!, My son enrolled for 1 year enrichment class. Results does not improved. I asked to cancel and refund my deposit. Only $200, The consultant is delaying my deposit for almost 2 months. I received the email that I will receive within 1 month. Till now Coming 2 months soon but no news. So desperate until cannot refund just $200. I paid $8000 plus one shot for year. Take money so fast. Refund deposit keep quiet. Not recommended to enrol, once you cancel their programme, reluctant to pay you back the deposit. After 28 jan, I haven‚Äôt received my money, i will report Mindchamps to consumer case. Customer service also very rude, when i told her i will consumer case, she quickly hang up the phone by saying thank you for calling. Education enrichment but no EQ from their employees. How to train the kids with their mindset?, I love MindChamps PreSchool as they taught them very well. They are well behaved., Dedicated school staffs and friendly teachers makes the whole school environment feel very positive, my boy looks forward to school everyday üòä ‚Ä¶, My champ has very big progress, Nice school n nice class teacher, Caring teachers, great facilities and amenities, wonderful environment for kids to grow and learn!, Fun at music workshop to understanx what the champs are experiencing., The teacher is nice.My kids like to go to school., Nurturing and learning environment, Nice teachers üëè ‚Ä¶, Wonderful experience, Great school for preschoolers!, Awesome school!, Ms Yumi's violin workshop was very good.

"Do not recommend . I would say there are better childcare , pre school out there. The building is not the most conducive. And parking is bad. Too tight the lobby, and the entrance into the school is not very welcoming. I recommend going to other childcare centers . At times, I have encountered that the security guards are rude and do not do their job. The traffic is also always congested and the building mgmt does not do anything. Teachers also have changed multiple times, no stability., The best preschool in the CBD area in my opinion; and possible the best Mindchamps chinese prschool branch even! A true gem! it may not be the biggest centre of Mindchamps but they deliver quality care and execution of the mindchamps curriculum. Principle + Teachers are great - very personable, patient and loving. My 3 kids enjoys going to sch everyday (im so thankful), i think that is the true indicator of how good this centre is! lunch is cooked in-house, not the catered stuff. Thank you teachers and staff for running the centre so well, this is the reason i continue to send through throughout covid until today! im just so glad that they are happy to follow me to work , happy to be dropped off and happy to be picked up at end of day. ‚ù§Ô∏è, One of the best decisions we‚Äôve made for our children is sending them to MindChamps at Cecil Street. They are so comfortably bilingual, it‚Äôs really worth all the time and effort to send them there.

Building is old , small , no parking , lifts breakdown , smells on level 1 with security guards who think they are meeting and greeting ü§°.  Take you money elsewhere ‚Ä¶, The only chinese preschool that is located in the cbd. Really appreciate mo laoshi and wang laoshi for being so dedicated to teaching the right values to my kid and taking care of him! My kid went in not understanding mandarin and he could understand instructions in chinese in just a week! Kudos to josephine as well for always putting a smile to every kid who checks into the school no matter what., My wife chose MIndChamps because the also offers Chinese Preschool which we think our child will greatly benefit him once he reach primary years. After three months of attending preschool classes at the age of 5, he can recognize Chinese characters which his teacher patiently taught him in a creative manner.  Maths and English were also given equal focus to equip our child in the future. We know that he is in good hands with MindChamps",0.2754939209726444,5,"['chinese', 'good', 'kid', 'teacher', 'preschool', 'school', 'building', 'time', 'centre', 'child', 'send', 'happy', 'mindchamp', 'think', 'mindchamps', 'go', 'guard', 'possible', 'staff', 'understand']",MindChamps Chinese PreSchool @ Cecil Street
"My girl joined MindChamps PreSchool PG class when she was 18 months old. I wanted to take a moment to express my deepest gratitude to Mrs Koh and her team on everything that they have done for my girl. Their support and kindness have meant more to us than words can express, and I am truly grateful for their help in taking such good care of my mighty champ in school. I never fail to receive timely updates on my girl and that ensures the ease of mind at work. Their unwavering commitment to parents and our children is truly inspiring, and we are so lucky to have the wonderful team ensuring the safety and wellbeing of our little ones at all times. Thank you again for everything. My girl will tell me every morning that she wants to go to school. I believe she truly enjoys herself in school with all the lovely teachers and friends., A heartfelt thank you to Mrs Koh and her team of teachers for taking such good care of both my daughters in school. Both my daughters love going to school and sharing things with their teachers and friends. It was definitely a pleasant experience working with the school from transiting from another preschool to achieving developmental milestones. Kudous to all teachers and staff of this preschool for a job well done! Highly recommended to anyone who is looking for the first preschool for your child., Our girl had been with the school since PG class. We saw her grow over the years into an confident, independent child who is capable of completing tasks such as getting dressed, going to the washroom, helping to put her own plates away after a meal at a tender age of 4! She had also learnt how to manage her emotions well with patient and constant guidance from her amazing teachers and Principal.  We love the school environment and we love the Principal and teachers even more! They are encouraging and know how to guide the preschoolers to take on new skills. The school also has a very comprehensive curriculum which includes culinary, gym and music on top of academic topics. Our girl never fails to share how much she enjoys school, reciting new songs she learnt, bringing back yummy treats she created in school and showing us what new numbers, alphabets and Chinese characters she was taught in class. We are confident these will build a solid foundation when she eventually transit to primary school., This MindChamps PreSchool is superb! Teachers and staffs are super caring and professional! I‚Äôll definitely plan to bring my kids over, just hope that they provide enough uniforms for the kids!

Teachers and staffs are calm and careful when handling children. Environment are safe and clean. Just that uniforms for the kids are not enough, best is the school can provide 4-5 sets for the kids then it will be perfect !, The teaching team & principal of the preschool are very professional and committed towards delivery of childhood education & development.

Moreover, the preshoool is located at an excellent environment !, We are glad that we made a right choice to register our girl in mc sentosa. She has been in the preschool for 3years. Our child started in PG and now, she is in N2. We have seen her developed so much in character shaping, confidence level, languages. It is definitely one of the top preschools that readily prepares students for primary.  In terms of outdoor activities, the school has a huge playground and a shared massive compound for the children to run around. They get to go out daily except on rainy days.  There are also excursions and water play sessions planned by the principal Mrs Koh and her spontaneous team of teachers. They will constantly upload the pictures and  keep parents updated.  In terms of academic, the teachers in-charge of the class will send a weekly update for English and Chinese via the app. Whenever we have something to clarify/inform, the teachers will promptly read the messages on the app during break time. There is always a two-way communication platform between the school and parents. As for school work, we always look forward to seeing their craft/assignments done in class. MC sentosa teachers indeed put in much effort and guidance. Teachers are  well groomed and staff turnover rate is low.  We would like to take this opportunity to thank Mrs Koh, all N2 teachers, Feng lao shi and Ms Pearlyn. Thank you for all the hard work and dedicating your passion in these.

He started in N1 and he is now in K1, and we were blessed he found his tribe here at school, from the great teachers to his classmates. He is fulfilled with joy and we are happy that his mind is both stimulated (structured teaching) and playful. We have now enroll our second kid as we are confident he will also be happy there.

It provides all rounded education and have nurtured my child‚Äôs love of nature, arts and music too! So glad to be part of this family!, My son enjoyed his time at Mindchamps. He is reserved and quiet but after attending Mindchamps, he became sociable and talked more. Teachers were kind and allowed him to experience a day as a monitor. It made his day and he told me about it. Thank you., Mindchamp Sentosa is a well organised preschool. I love the clean classrooms with huge windows,  They also have a big playground for kids to play outdoor. Dedicated and professional staffs and friendly teachers makes the whole school environment very positive. My daughter has been a N2 student at Mindchamp Sentosa for 8 month. She is going to K1 next year. I am impressed by the professionalism of the principal, Mrs Koh, as well as Ms Anna and Teacher Feng  and Teacher Sun, my child‚Äôs teachers. I feel very safe to send my kid to school everyday., We really appreciate Mrs Koh and her team, working alongside us as first time parent, guiding and supporting us in our parenting journey, especially during our kid's challenging stages, showering comfort and instilling confidence in us., The school is easy to access and has new facilitates for the children. Compared to other pre-schools in Singapore, the curriculum seemed solid and really enticing for toddlers.  This is why we decided to enroll our first child at MindChamps Sentosa. Our daughter loves her school and her teachers! The environment for the kids is great and lots of care and attention are dedicated to their individual self-development. We received regular and detailed feedback through the reports shared and parents-teacher zoom call are hold to keep the parents abreast of the child development.  We are happy with the school, thus, it was an obvious choice to enroll our second child at MindsChamp Sentosa.  Thank you for looking after the development of my children., Our child has been going to Mindchamps Sentosa for close to a year now. He has made so much progress thanks to the well structured learning programme. The teachers are professional and they truly care for the children very much. Mrs Koh, Ms Pearlyn, Ms Kudeep, Ms Casey, Ye Lao Shi, Ms Yuva and many others are excellent teachers! We have complete peace of mind sending our child there everyday., Thank you Ms Yuva, Ye Laoshi, Zhang Laoshi, Ms Belle and all other MC Sentosa teachers for being so patient and loving in nurturing my son. My son started PG in May and he is very much enjoying school (sometimes even refusing to leave!) Appreciate the regular photos and school updates via the app/FB which brightens our day and gives us a peace of mind that our children are in good hands and having fun :), Currently the only preschool on Sentosa offering a curriculum based on our local schools calendar. It‚Äôs comparably more academically focused, probably with the intention of having its graduates assimilate into primary school better. Our daughter likes her teachers - says they are ‚Äúfunny‚Äù, which is the highest compliment coming from the 3 year old., Our daughter is almost 3 years old and has been attending for 3 months now. Previously she attended a well regarded day care as well. We are very happy with MindChamps Sentosa. Top reasons: 1. The Teachers are very organised and the curriculum is well structured with Chinese and art. Children thrive on structure. 2. Very large facilities with much options for play, exploring, and physical exercise. Please tire her out! 3. The app and pages give us lots of visibility of what is going on and our child‚Äôs happiness. 4. The mix of children are friendly and active.

Our little girl just finds it more enjoyable here., Our child attended Mindchamps Sentosa since PG and we have seen her tremendous growth over the years, turning into an amazing child full of knowledge, confidence and life's zest. A great thumbs up to the amazing school team and a big thank you for their great passion and professionalism., My daughter joined MindChamps Preschool @ Sentosa since N2. Prior to that, she was really shy and refused to speak up. We weren‚Äôt too confident of her developments as well. MindChamps provided a solid platform on both academic and physical fronts. She now interacts and speaks well, and likes going to school to hang out with her classmates., We enrolled our two year-old at MindChamps Sentosa for one month while traveling for work. Mrs. Koh, Mrs. Casey, and all the staff and teachers were wonderful. Working with the admin was fast and efficient and they were always very responsive. Most importantly our son LOVED his experience. He was always excited to go to school and would come home and enthusiastically share things he'd learned or done. He made some real leaps in his verbal/conversational abilities as well. To be honest we weren't sure what to think of the school at first because it's a commercial chain and located in a resort hotel; however, we would definitely enroll our son again if given the chance (for comparison we were also looking at Eton House but they were not very flexible in terms of either enrollment or shorter term instruction, and would have been much more expensive). Overall, the educational and cultural experience was great for our son and he will forever be a MindChamp!, We were very fortunate to find MindChamps at Resorts World Sentosa.  We looked at a number of schools available in the area and are very pleased we elected for our 3 year old daughter to start with MindChamps in June of this year and now also our 18 month old son who started in October.  Mrs Koh is an amazing Principal. From the moment we met her, we have been amazed at the way in which she connects with all of the students, teachers and parents. Very professional, diligent and always approachable.  Each of the students are encouraged to develop independence and responsibility. We have found our 3 year old thrives on the responsibility and it has assisted in her growth. Ms Joyce is our daughter‚Äôs teacher and we are so fortunate to have such a loving and committed teacher. She always seems to make time to communicate end of the day messages and share very specific insights into our daughter‚Äôs day.  We highly recommend any parent looking for an early stage schooling option to meet with Mrs Koh and spend time with her to understand her passion and competence of not only herself but all of her staff and the amazing program that is offered at MindChamps., My kid has been attending for 2 months, and we can see a positive change in him. His temperament has become better. He is also very cheerful, and loves the teachers there. Thanks to Teacher Pearlyn and Mrs Koh who have shared with us about tips on parenting tips at home so we can align and allow our kid to transit faster. They are very observant with our kid too, hence allowing him to learn and play in the best way suitable for him. We also love the welcoming environment to receive the kid everyday at school. Thanks to Teacher J and all the other teachers who played a part too!, My child has been in the school for close to 1.5 years. The teachers are responsible and caring. Updates of the kids progress in school are prompt.  Feedbacks given to the principal Mrs koh are taken seriously. Lots of improvements are being seen in school. The school practice very good hygiene as well.  The fact that my child looks forward going to school daily shows she is very happy settling in the school and enjoy the class activities.  Thankful to Ms Sya, teacher Feng, Ms pearlyn and any other teachers that I have missed out.  Thank you for being so patient and kind to the children., We love the clean classrooms with huge windows that let in plenty of natural light. We are also impressed by the passion and professionalism of the staff - Mrs Koh, the principal, as well as Sun Lao Shi and Ms Casey, our child‚Äôs teachers. Our child enjoys going to school everyday., The teachers are very professional and timely in their communications with parents. I can also sense that they genuinely care for the well being of the children and show a lot of patience and interest in what they do. My daughter has benefited from this environment and I would like to give a big shout out to Mrs Koh and her team for a job well done!, My boy went in last year when he was N1 and he barely spoke a couple of words but through the patience and guidance of the teachers in 2 months he became a very chatty boy whose vocabulary has increased tremendously. My little one always had a seperation anxiety and would cry and cry when he entered school. In his previous school he cried for months before he got used to it. But with the love and assurance of his teachers and principal Mrs Koh, he walked in proudly to school within a couple of months. In addition, when he first entered the school he was not potty trained and not ready for potty training but the teachers were convinced he could get it off and within 3 days he was off the diapers and officially potty trained. He now loves to go to school so much he would go on the weekends if the school was open. Thank u to Mrs Koh and all the Mindchamp teachers!!, I can see the genuine love and care that the principal Mrs Koh and the teachers have for both my girls especially Ms Anna and Ms Sabrina. This gives me a great relief knowing that my girls are in great loving hands. Thanks for their support, my girls can adapt pretty well and they loves going to school.  I'm happy with the constant updates from the teachers and management through various platforms puts my mind at ease when it comes to their learning and development in school. We're very glad that we enrolled the girls in Mindchamps Sentosa! Love the excellent environment!, Mindchamps sentosa is a wonderful school with very dedicated teachers and a brand new facility. There is a great mix of play and interesting ways that the school inculcates knowledge, habits and self-help skills. All the teachers in the school go above and beyond and they are really committed in helping students succeed., We had gone through less ideal experience with previous childcare centre, hence we were stringent about finding the right one for my girl who is currently in K2 to prepare her well for primary school next year. Thankfully, we found MindChamps Sentosa and we are glad to have made this decision.  Thumbs up to all the Mindchamps teachers and principal for the attentiveness they give to my girl. She loves going to school and came back sharing her learning and fun moments she had in school. Love the location with fun environment and also the spacious gym area!, Amazing school, great teachers and support. This is my son's second school, he loves school and talks about his teaching and learning at home which was totally the opposite as his first.  Teacher helps him to settle magically which made me super happy and relieved. Thank you!, MindChamps sentosa is a great place for any child to grow, learn and love! The school teachers and principle are very professional. My experience as a first time parent sending my 18 months toddler to school was made so relaxed because of how wonderful the team is. They took their time to answer the ample questions I have as a first time parent sending my kid to school and I appreciate that a lot. Teachers gave a lot of updates on my child‚Äôs progression. They diligently check back on how she is also doing at home so both parties know that we are on the right track. They not only care about if she is learning, they also care how she is doing it.  I believe the reason why my daughter transited very well in school was because the team made her comfortable, trust was established well, the environment was clean and happy with a awesome colourful gym which she absolutely love.  It‚Äôs been only 8 months now that my child has started school, she has since picked up a lot of good habits, learned a lot while being really happy doing it. She loves going to school everyday.  Excellent communication from the principle Mrs Koh and Ms Pearlyn and the rest of the team!, This is our son‚Äôs second week with MindChamps @ Sentosa and I am proud to say that my husband and I have definitely made a wise decision to enrol our son to this preschool.  It is our honor and utmost pleasure to have a group of very passionate teachers around our son. Every morning during the drop off, Chu ËÄÅÂ∏à and Yuan ËÄÅÂ∏à never fail to greet us with smiles despite being ‚Äúpunched‚Äù and ‚Äúkicked‚Äù by our son (separation anxiety +++).  Ms Pearlyn and Âè∂ËÄÅÂ∏à are our son‚Äôs class teacher. We have to say that the both of them are extremely loving and caring teachers. They have been great in sharing information and providing interim updates on Atlanto‚Äôs progress in school. We cannot be more assured to leave our baby in their hands. Though we haven‚Äôt had much opportunity to interact with our son‚Äôs enrichment teacher - Ms Belle, we have a good sense that she share similar traits as the former two.  We are extremely grateful to the Senior Principal, Mrs Koh, for accepting our son into the school on a short notice. If you are still searching for a preschool, look no further - MindChamps @ Sentosa is no doubt an excellent choice., Love all the teachers and staff here! My son has progressed a whole lot in all aspects in a short time. Should have registered him sooner üòÇ  The teachers always put in extra effort and do all they can for my son to receive the best care and education. Really appreciate it. Thank you!  Will definitely recommend to family and friends who have young kids ‚ò∫Ô∏è, The teachers are superb. They are extremely attentive to the children‚Äôs development. I like that there is a lot science behind MindChamps‚Äô philosophy. I also have a lot of trust that the school will keep my child safe at all times. The only aspect that can me improved further is more frequent with parents on how the kids faired throughout the week. Perhaps a more detailed weekly report / feedback on the app could be a convenient  way of communicating., My daughter attends Mindchamp (Kinex), which is also cared by the same team under Mrs Koh. We love how our daughter enjoys the endless enrichments in school. In her first year preschool, she can name me both teachers and friends, who she loves to play with.  The teachers are very attentive and yet firm. They are up-to-date with what's happening to her and we work both ways towards her needs. A very supportive and welcoming environment and we are glad to have her in this school.  Now that there is a Sentosa branch cared by the same team, I believe that we will get the same vibes as well. Love to arrange a school tour, just in case we are shifting back to that area., Both my children attend Mindchamps and they truly enjoy their time in school with the teachers and friends. Throughout 2020-2021, there were a lot of disruptions to the classes due to the pandemic.

Truly appreciate the tremendous effort by the school to keep the children occupied and safe at the same time. Thank you !, My boy joined Mindchamps since PG and now already in N2. I‚Äôm amazed to see how much he has developed, in terms of language, numeracy, the way he speaks and behaves, really just wowed me away.

It‚Äôs a bittersweet feeling because I think the Teachers in MC are amazing - I know my child is in good hands, the Teachers are caring, loving, nurturing and they are extremely passionate about what they do. They always go above and beyond, putting an extra mile in making sure that no one gets left behind, socially, emotionally and academically.

"Teachers are patient and responsible. They has a great bond with the child and create an engaging learning environment. My child is having a great time in the center. Not to mentioned the great food variety that cater to taste bud of the kid. All in all a great space for the little champs., Mindspace impresses with its nurturing environment and dedicated staff. The facility prioritises safety and engages children with creative activities, fostering both cognitive and emotional development. Parents appreciate the transparent communication and personalised care plans. Mindspace stands out as a trusted choice for families seeking a supportive early childhood experience., The centre is well equipped (eg nicely furnished classroom, indoor playground and water park) coupled with specially designed curriculum and teaching methods, providing the champs with a conducive learning environment. In addition, there is constant engagement from a dedicated team of administrative and teaching staffs on the happenings and update on the champs., My daughter enjoys her time at MindSpace. She learns techniques which aids in her academic. The curriculum is well balanced with relaxing time for the students. Holiday programs are well planned with interesting activities to keep them entertained and interested.  Teachers are responsible and they give feedback whenever necessary.  The environment is conducive and comfy. My daughter likes to gather around the cafe area with her friends during playtime. There are board games where they can play with.  I know my daughter is in good hands with such a responsible team in this student care. Highly recommend MindSpace @ Bishan!, The centre is clean and well-maintained, with healthy meals for the kids. The  teachers not only help ensure homework is completed but also offer guidance when my child needs extra support. This has been incredibly helpful in freeing up our evenings and weekends to spend more quality time together with my child, without having to worry about homework. There are also books, board games, indoor playground and water play area which adds an extra element of fun!, Mindspace not only teaches academic subjects, but also teaches students the right attitude to learn, keeping trying and never give up. That is an important learning aspect., We were choosing between Mindspace and another after school care centre in the same area when my daughter was about to commence her primary 1 education. After the school tours, we were convinced that Mindspace will be the right place for my daughter.  Firstly, we were impressed with the state of art classrooms, healthy meals from Nature Farm, indoor water playground and indoor playground and garden.  Secondly, Desmond and Marie were very professional and it‚Äôs obvious they take great pride in the branding of Mindspace. Marie also did some tests for my daughter to assess her pre-primary school capabilities.  Thirdly, we like it that Mindspace also provides Chinese enrichment class so we do not need to bring my daughter to an external vendor for Chinese class.  So far, my daughter always sounds very excited when we fetch her from Mindspace about her time in Mindspace and she will share with us things that she learnt, including idioms and books she read in MindSpace Cafe. Keep the good work up, Desmond and team!, my child loves to attend mindspace and he is happy that he is learning and having fun at the same time! great place to be since they will be engaged and not wasting time as usually for lower primary not much homework!, My child enjoyed her lessons in mindspace. It gives me assurance that my child is in good hands. Thanks mindspace midview city team, Have been a delight to send my child to MS @ bishan. Very attentive teachers and superb program. My child can‚Äôt wait to go for student care!, Mindspace is a place to be, closest being second home for the children, Kids seem to enjoy their time there.

"I am satisfied how MindChamps helps my child develop his writing skills. He started attending sessions at the age of 6. The management introduce to us their curriculum which we are really impressed because it is inclined with MOE English curriculum standards. Their Writing Tool Box is effective because we can see how our son improves his writing composition. His passion in English writing grows fonder with the help of his teachers at MindChamps and I am running out of words to thank them for their effort., Admin staff attitude really really really very very very lousy. As 3 years loyalty customer, I'm really disappointed, especially the Indian staff, really no manner, hand up the phone during my talking time.

"Deciding to send our kid to MindSpace @ Tai Seng, Grantral Mall was a game-changer; we were glad we made that decision.  The dedication and hard work put in by the center managers and trainers is nothing short of remarkable. From coaching the kids to managing the center's operations, planning events, and keeping us informed about our child's progress, they handle it all with such finesse, it's like watching a well-oiled machine in action.  Before MindSpace, our child seemed to exhibit learning challenges and behavioral hurdles: throwing tantrums when asked to do home work, unable to comprehend basic arithmetic, and disliking classes.  We were pleasantly surprised that after going to MindSpace, he is actually looking forward to attend MindSpace. His attitude towards homework has improved, and he is showing significant improvement in behaviour. We were happy when the school teachers told us that they noticed an improvement with our child.  It's got me thinking-if MindSpace can work wonders for our child, maybe they have a secret recipe for adults too. MindSpace, any chance of an adult program? Sign me up; I'm ready to experience that transformation firsthand!, The centre is well organised and teachers are friendly and knowledgeable. My kid is adapting well in the centre and would recommend anyone who is interested in signing up for Mindspace to consider this centre., Sending my niece to Mindspace@Tai Seng is the best education decision I have made!  My niece (a typical heartlander) became more interactive, can articulate and express herself better.  When I run into logistics coordination problems, the business owner, Ching & her team staff helped me with sincere and stress-free assistance with great initiative. It had helped me in dual capacity as in improving both education where I can focus on work concentration.  Their enrichment  are aligned with MOE and to my knowledge the only enrichment programme  currently with PSLE results verified by KPMG in Singapore which is quality controlled.  Many thanks & keep up with the great work :), We had a wonderful experience at Mindspace Tai Seng. The trainers are very dedicated in nurturing our son even though this is a after school care. The school work hand in hand with parents to optimize the on the learning environment for our son. It's sad that we had to leave due to relocation, but we are very much looking forward to put our son back upon return. Thank you all the trainers in MindSpace Tai Seng for providing a conducive environment for our son., My son had some difficulty to new environment and was not adapting well in previous school hence i chance upon and read up on MindSpace and decided to make the change midyear for my son. I was amazed by the professional teachers handling my son on his very 1st day. When i picked up my son he was already looking forward to go back to MindSpace the next day! Thanks to the awesome admin team and teachers for the great service! Highly recommended!!, I am glad that we decided to place our child in this Centre. The teachers are attentive and most importantly, they are trained on proper ways to handle children. I have my peace of mind placing them here. My child‚Äôs grade also show good improvement after joining the center. Thank you and pls keep it up!!, MindSpace (Grantral Mall) provides a very nice and conducive environment for learning. The trainers are also prompt in providing updates on my son's progress.  He is enjoying himself a lot in the centre and is doing well in terms of curriculum and homework. I would highly recommend parents to try out MindSpace!, I would like to express my heartfelt gratitude to Mindspace for their outstanding dedication and commitment to taking care of my 2 children. Their tireless efforts to review homework with my children have reduced the amount of time and effort I need to spend on them after work. The art of learning and champion mindset programme teaches them life skills that they can apply in an evolving environment, beyond formal education years. They have provided a nurturing and safe environment for children to learn, grow and have fun., My daughter used to dislike going to student care. She didn't like the teachers and centre that she used to attend. Until we switch over to mindspace at Grantral Mall (tai seng)  The centre is very clean and organised.  The teachers are friendly . My daughter totally love going to student care now. She will come home to share with me what she do in school. Teachers not only teaches in an interesting and interactive way. My daughter have so much fun . My daughter now become very organised and will love to do her homework . More discipline now too.  Thank you so much to the teachers in mindspace, I chanced upon this after school student care through a leaflet sent in my mailbox. Initially, I did not think very much about it till I met my sister who then just recovered from a nasty episode of COVID. I could see that she was definitely not as fit as before and on top of that, she shared that her grandson is attending several after school enrichment programmes in the week. Being the day carer for this boy, she has to make multiple trips per day.  There I was looking at the leaflet for the second time that week and realised that this could solve some of the issues my sister was facing. I called up the centre and expressed my concern on behalf of my sister and Ms Ching Ching has been very attentive and empathetic of our situation. She assured me that her centre is able to help us overcome the challenges that we are facing.  We attended the open house last December and we liked the place as the setup of the centre is conducive, is bright and the layout is fairly spacious. Everything in there are new as we understand the centre is at its start-up phase and most importantly, it is very convenient for us either by MRT or bus.  Without much hesitation, we signed him up and since then, we have been in touch with the trainers, who are also very responsive with our queries and concerns on the day to day basis. The trainers update us frequently on his learning, behaviour as well as suggestions for areas of improvement which we can work with him at home. Due to the close working relationship between the trainers and us, we do see a significantly improvement in his social skills and his academic achievements. I did notice that he is now willing to work with a more challenging peer in this small group setting which otherwise he would avoid even being near to them in a school setting. This value is definitely very well inculcated and many thanks to the trainers in this centre who constantly remind them about peer inclusion and showing empathy towards others.  Lastly, we really appreciated the variety of the lunch menu and the quality of the food. The picky eater (my grand nephew) is now open to eating out of his comfort zone. This is definitely a bonus for him and us.  To date, we are pleased with his development and we will continue to work with the trainers for the betterment of him., The systematic approach and caring demeanor of teachers provide a sense of reassurance to parents., Went to see the centre and it was so well organised and kept clean and spotless. As I am aware of the values that mindspace represents, I am convinced that this will be the place for my children to be at after school.  Solves my issue of having to make sure that my children are well looked after and that they spend productive time after school., School is nice & clean.

A heartfelt thanks to my son's teachers in PG & N1, Ms Yuva, Ms Belle, Ms Hidayah, Ms Veronica but especially to Âè∂ËÄÅÂ∏à who is instrumental in my son's development. From understanding his character and being firm with him when need be in order to shape him into a caring and understanding boy, to sharing constant updates on his eating, sleep, toilet training, little milestones which parents may not always notice or be around to see it. Now in N2, he has blossom into a talkative and articulate boy thanks to Ms Sya, Ms Joyce, Ms Cheryl, Ms Naz, ÈÇµËÄÅÂ∏à. My son enjoys school everyday and he surprises me with words and sentences I dont expect at his age, all thanks to the hard work of his teachers to make learning fun! One of the most amazing moments was doing friendly Fridays where parents can enter the school to see how our kids in their classrooms and all the kids were watching the Chinese teachers act out the story of the 3 little pigs, with props that they created themselves. They were so engaging and held the children's rapt attention. Such a fun way to be learning and getting them interested! I have always recommended my friends to Mindchamps as they have always been providing my whole family with an amazing experience.

In terms of academic, the teachers in-charge of the class will send a weekly update for English and Chinese via the app. Whenever we have something to clarify/inform, the teachers will promptly read the messages on the app during break time. There is always a two-way communication platform between the school and parents. As for school work, we always look forward to seeing their craft/assignments done in class.

"MindChamps sentosa is a great place for any child to grow, learn and love! The school teachers and principle are very professional.

"Curriculum The MindChamps curriculum and values are unmatched, from day 1 of enrolment, the Mindchamps team addresses your champ by name, and in time to come, my kid addresses each and every one of his subject teacher by name, mutual respect at a young age! Location One of the rare locations in the city where you can literally drop off your kid at the driveway and walk 5 metres to the school, no need to rush into carparks and basements, drop off and pick up is a 1 minute affair, not to mention the MindChamps team makes the effort to recognise your vehicle so your kid is ready to go the moment you walk up to the door, never had to wait longer than a couple of minutes. City Campus The centre lacks an inhouse indoor playground but they do make use of Marina square's public playgrounds for the kids to enjoy themselves, a hidden benefit - my kid seldom goes goo-goo over indoor playgrounds anymore as he does it on school time anyway, and getting him to leave one is easy, the school has conditioned him well. Talk about raising a city kid! Staff Hospitality I recall the first time we visited the centre in the morning, most of the kids were running into the school, and it's with no surprise, there's always a very warm welcome at the door greeting every kid good morning as they get ready through the health checks before school, so they get all hyped up about school the moment they step through the doors. Chinese Education There is a dedicated chinese lessons and teacher for every level, for a family that speaks only English at home, my kid picked up a remarkable amount of Chinese words for his age. Summary A famous chinese proverb goes ""‰∏âÂ≤ÅÂÆöÂÖ´ÂçÅ"", if you're looking for a place for your kid to develop with the right values, principles and literal/motor competency, I'll bet my last nickel with the folks here at Marina MindChamps. Update: My sister saw the development in my kid and registered both her elder daughter in the Mindspace program and transfered her younger daughter to a Mindchamps near her place, kudos to the MindChamps team!",0.23554029304029306,5,"['kid', 'mindchamps', 'school', 'chinese', 'city', 'door', 'time', 'team', 'playground', 'moment', 'goo', 'teacher', 'morning', 'young', 'place', 'centre', 'indoor', 'walk', 'address', 'ready']",MindChamps Performing Arts PreSchool @ Marina Square

"""My son has been in MindChamps since he was 20 months old but transferred to MindChamps Sengkang in June 2023 when he was in N2 because he didn't seem to enjoy his last centre as much as I had hoped he would. Transferring him here was the best decision I've ever made. The teachers in this school are outstanding in every way - they are a truly passionate, nurturing group of educators who love what they do and the children that they teach. And this love is quite evidently reciprocated by the students, who can't seem to get enough of school! My son longs to return to school even on weekends. Thank you for making school a very happy place to be at, as it should be. :) Shout out to Ms Hepzi, Ji Laoshi, Ms Ross, Mr Jeremy, Ms Anne, Ms Amenda and Ms Sharlene for always being so warm and attentive. If you're looking for a preschool that not only excels in its curriculum but provides a safe, nurturing and genuinely compassionate environment, look no further.

"My kid is usually slow to warm up in schools. He appeared very comfortable with the teachers and school in just 3 weeks. The things he learnt is in 6months is way much more than the 7 months he was in the previous school. I believe that school is not just about phonics, language, math and words, but also about knowledge around the world. He often comes back sharing about what he learns and some happenings in school. This is something which was not observed in previous schools. All these attribute to the committed teachers. They genuinely want to know more about the kid and make the effort to engage the kids. The support and nurturing environment is definitely one of the factors that allow him to open up faster. They help the kids to excel further in their strengths while encouraging them to work on their weaknesses. The curriculum in the school emphasises all aspects of development. The kids also get some exposure to performances that helps to build up their confidence. I love the open communication with the teachers. The teachers are very approachable and we do get regular updates about their progress in school. No regrets in sending my kid to the school.

"In June, we enrolled our daughter at MindChamps, and the transformation we've witnessed in her has been truly remarkable. She now effortlessly manages her daily routines and eagerly looks forward to attending school each day. One of the aspects we appreciate the most is the thoughtfully designed curriculum. It caters to the holistic development of our child, addressing her social and emotional skills, which we hold in high regard. MindChamps excels in guiding her social behaviors and provides ample opportunities for her to shine in public settings. Under the leadership of the dynamic Principal, Ms. Amenda, MindChamps has organised community outreach events for the children to participate in. In a short period, our girl has been involved in events such as the ""Grand mall opening ceremony"" and the ""Mid-Autumn Festival performance."" The teaching staff at MindChamps is truly exceptional. Their dedication and professionalism shine through in every interaction. We would like to express our heartfelt gratitude to Ms. Lydia and Ji laoshi, our daughter's form teachers, for their unwavering patience and timely feedback, which have played a significant role in her growth. We also want to extend our appreciation to Ms. Chantille, our daughter's English program (MRW) teacher, for her guidance and support, which have enabled our girl to read English books fluently at her level. When it comes to Music, Mr. Jeremy has been a fantastic mentor, and our daughter now enjoys playing the violin and other instruments. Last but not least, a big thank you to Ms. Hepzi, who consistently adds a fun element to Nuro Move. Your contributions to our daughter's overall development are greatly appreciated. Every day, our daughter discovers something new at this preschool. It's the perfect environment for her to learn, explore, and flourish.

"My experience with this preschool has been nothing short of exceptional, and I am beyond grateful for the positive impact it has had on my sons. When my older son first started at MindChamps, he never spoke a single word of Mandarin. However, with the incredible guidance of his Chinese teacher, Ji Lao Shi, he has opened up to the language in a way that I couldn't have imagined. It's truly remarkable to see how he has progressed and embraced Mandarin under Ji Lao Shi's care and instruction. One of the things I really love about this school is the extensive exposure it provides to children. My sons have had the opportunity to explore various interests, including learning musical instruments like the violin at such a tender age. They even had the chance to perform at a public venue, and I could see how much they enjoyed the experience. It's heartwarming to witness their enthusiasm for learning and self-expression. The teachers at MindChamps, especially Ji Lao Shi, Miss Lydia, Miss Chantille, Miss Joy, Li Lao Shi, and Ling Lao Shi, are exceptional. They played a pivotal role in easing both my sons' transition into the school. It's evident that they genuinely care and love my children, which, as a parent, is what matters most to me. The support and nurturing environment they provide make all the difference. I must also commend the principal, Miss Amenda, for her attentiveness towards parent feedback. It's truly amazing to have a principal who values and listens to parents' opinions and concerns. Academically and holistically, my sons have shown significant improvement since joining MindChamps Preschool Sengkang. I wholeheartedly recommend this preschool to other parents seeking a nurturing and enriching environment for their children.

And these three In the past few months, with the help of the teacher, my sister's independent reading ability in Chinese and English has also been greatly improved. Occasionally, she would make superfluous remarks in the conversation, play the piano to an ox; or take out a Level 4 Oxford tree and relish it in the corner. When reading, the old mother felt really happy. After all, every parent hopes that their children can develop a good habit of independent learning as they grow up, and have a happy and splendid childhood.

She often gives us surprises, for example, keeps her own toys, asked for permissions to do certain things, know how to be kind or apologize when something goes wrong, speak proper sentences, able to share her toys and food etc On top of that, the school activities also help her to further develop the mind, writing her very first alphabet and initiate to sit at one corner to flip the books and using her little fingers to go through all the sentences. We did not imagine our active child who just turned 3-year-old, is capable to do all these by herself. We look forward for more of her good character being build up in this school.

I would highly recommend Mindchamps Kinex to any potential parents looking for a holistic preschool for your child. The outdoor play area is great for the kids to get some sun and run around. The teachers are kind and caring. The principal helms the centre efficiently and is friendly yet professional with parents. What I especially like is that Mrs Koh emphasises on the importance of discipline and having good moral values and not just on academics. The teachers did a great job during the circuit breaker and went above and beyond their call of duty to ensure the charges under their care were still learning from home and having fun. The mgmt has taken many steps to ensure the children are safe and happy in school given the current constraints. Kudos to the team at Kinex!,0.3521875,2,"['ensure', 'have', 'great', 'child', 'kinex', 'teacher', 'parent', 'potential', 'caring', 'mgmt', 'koh', 'moral', 'outdoor', 'go', 'value', 'good', 'academic', 'take', 'helm', 'friendly']",MindChamps PreSchool @ East Coast
"Thank you to the teachers in Mindchamps @ One KM. I noticed that my child, Leanne has improved so much when it comes to her learning. I know her achievements today are because of your dedication and passion. Really appreciate that the teachers actually take time to speak to me regarding Leanne's ability to focus in class (glad that it is better now), correcting bad behaviours and picking up on little things that we as parents do not notice at home. I love how the teachers always come up with ideas for school activities, excursions and bringing the children out for musicals and plays. Of course, not forgetting the signature sleepover event... Thank you so much for partnering us in nurturing the child‚Äôs future! It feels good to know that my child is learning and growing in an environment like this, It is my second year here, but I have witnessed the teachers' dedication and love in teaching the children.

"We love this PreSchool. Both my children are here from PG to K2 and never once do we have to worry if they would be mistreated or whatsoever at school because the teachers here are experienced and delicated. The outdoor playground is huge and there is water play from time to time. Both my children started off shy and reserved but the teachers managed to help them build up their confidence till they moved on to Primary school as confident individuals. We are so grateful to the teachers here who helped us mound their character so well. They learnt responsibilities, to care and to share. Most importantly, both built up a deep love for attending school, they both were happy and loves attending MindChamps to the extent that they just wish they can turn back time and stay on as babies.

They loved every bit of it and looked forward to school every morning, as they never complained about having to attend school. We've seen how well they progressed over the years and we are very pleased to have made this wise choice. We'd highly recommend Mindchamps Preschool to parents who prefer a more holistic approach to teaching and learning. This is particularly important to nurture lifelong interest in learning and to help my children cope with the world ahead of them. Besides, we are also happy with the activities-filled curiculum, perhaps that is the reason why our kids were often entusiatics learning new things. The teachers are always helpful, patient, kind and cheerful, which never failed to amaze us with their passion and dedication to their job. Kudos to the Principal Mrs Koh who did a fantastic job!

"We enrolled our son with Mindchamps Kinex during the circuit breaker through a friend‚Äôs recommendation and we never looked back. We were apprehensive initially because of the timing that we enrolled our son, but that quickly dissipated. The school took social distancing and personal hygiene very seriously, requiring the children to wash their hands frequently. They even specially sourced a face shield for them. Pre-covid days, the parents were able to sit in with their child during the first week of school for a smooth transition. This was something we couldn‚Äôt do. Rachel understood our anxieties and for the first week, she attached Miss Pearlyn with our son to slowly warm him up to the environment and they gave us constant updates to assure us. Rachel and her whole team of teachers are very loving, passionate, dedicated and nurturing. Every single teacher regardless of the level that they were in charged of, were familiar with every child in Kinex from PG to K2. The feeling they gave us was that the entire school was one big happy family. All the teachers there have been teaching there for a considerable number of years. Attrition rate is low and they have a great seamless system and clockwork going on. This has to be attributed to Rachel‚Äôs strong leadership. No child or parent gets left behind. They were there every step of the way with us right from the start, responding to our many queries, allaying our fears and making sure our child and every child gets to fulfill their best potential in their time. They were there to encourage them when needed, yet being firm with him and rewarding him when he does something positive. Besides focusing on the curriculum, Rachel and the teachers also made sure the childrens‚Äô social skills and inculcation of values were not missed out on either. Those to us were more important than the curriculum itself. We did not have to worry one bit putting our son with Mindchamps Kinex whilst working. We know that he was in the best hands. It was very sad and heartbreaking that we had to leave kinex for another branch because we relocated to the other end of the island. We have Rachel and her stellar team to thank for setting such a good foundation in our child that he transited well in the new school. I cannot thank especially Rachel, Miss Neesha, Miss Anna, Miss Pearlyn, feng lao shi, Miss Camille enough.

For engaging children with little interaction with Chinese at home) 2. Safe Environment - how they handle misbehaviour, cleaning and sanitisation, and separate bathroom for boys and girls to protect their modesty from young. 3. Holistic education - Not just academic focused but overall exposure to different learnings at their young age (eg. Gym class, confidence in speaking in front of peers, simple cookery class, artwork, playtime in playground, music etc) 4. No homework for parents except for K2 (spelling only).

"I want to share my experience for the past few months with MindChamps Paragon. Some background of my son, who is turning five this year. He has been attending an International school in Brunei since he was two and a half years old before returning to Singapore on the 31st of November. The school with huge compounds, three canteens, excellent facilities, and large playgrounds, even just for kindergarten level. When he was in the international school, he was neutral, neither eager nor enthusiastic about school. During covid lockdown, he didn‚Äôt care whether he would be going to school the next day or not. After returning, I decided to enroll my son in Mindchamp Paragon. At first, I wasn‚Äôt very optimistic due to the limited area to play compared to the international school in Brunei. But this is what it is when we are in a scarce land city-state. As I would like my son to master his mandarin better, at home, we are only allowed to converse in mandarin as I would want my son to master at least in his mandarin speaking. During the enrolment, I specifically emphasized to the Teachers to encourage my son to speak more mandarin to him instead of English. To my surprise! After the first day of school, my son loves going back to MindChamps Paragon. Every day, even on weekends, without fail, he will ask me if there‚Äôs school tomorrow. He had shown so much interest in going to school that he did not have that enthusiasm in his previous school. After the first week of attending Mindchamps paragon, he has improved his mandarin speaking. In the following weeks, my son has shown significant improvements in his eagerness to write and draw, which he has lack of previously. Besides, the teachers went above and beyond to ensure the children were comfortable and well taken care of. This is the first time I have seen such a high level of dedication by the teachers, especially Fan Laoshi, Ms. Cammy, and Ms. Lee. After a long absence from lockdown, when school reopens, toddlers will typically take about a week to accept and adjust to new environments and routines. What took my son a week in the previous school, in mindchamps paragon, only one day. To my surprise, he was eager to go back to school the following day without the first day crying drama or pleading to go home, etc. It‚Äôs such a pity that we will be relocating again in the coming month. If it weren‚Äôt for relocating, we would be glad to continue with mindchamps paragon as long as the highest level mindchamps provides... My son and I are going to miss this excellent school!

We appreciate the attentiveness that most of the Teachers give to the Champs professionally and the time they took to brief us every single day during pick up time. Some teachers would do the extra miles to attend to champs with special needs and to be able to understand that each house hold is different. Their roles at school were as equally important as mom‚Äôs roles at home, they are giving knowledge and implanting discipline that sometimes parents failed to do at home. We are VERY grateful for the Teachers. I apologize if I missed some names but I honestly hope that it won‚Äôt affect any of their good dedications and caring, from Miss Eunice, Wu Laoshi, Fan Laoshi, Miss Bev, Miss Cam, Ms Cleris, Ms Nadia, Ms Jasmine, Mr Jay .. even the previous Ah Yis who used to work there at PRG.

"I can still remember the time when I was trying to find the best preschool in Singapore for my then two-year-old boy. I visited a few schools, but none could beat the ‚ÄúThis is the right one‚Äù feel of MindChamps PreSchool at Paragon. The school was brimming with positivity and light. Children wore big smiles on their faces, greeting their friends, teachers and even schoolmates‚Äô parents; teachers were warm and energetic, and the ambience was bright and colourful. They had me at ‚Äòhello‚Äô. Within a year in MindChamps, he is not only speaking in full sentences but spewing out bombastic words that I‚Äôve never heard of in my life. When asked what he likes best about his school, his response is, ‚ÄúMy friends and teachers‚Äù. I think he doesn‚Äôt know how to say it yet, but I believe it‚Äôs more than just these two fundamental reasons for him liking school. I think to him, schooling in MindChamps is like an adventure or a journey to exciting discoveries. My husband and I too, are very fond of MindChamps.

"Sending my boy, Asher to MindChamps has been a great decision that both of us as parents have made. Mindchamps has been a great platform for Asher to develop in terms of cognitive and personality. Prior to sending Asher to Mindchamps, he was shy and quiet but Mindchamps has moulded him into an outgoing little boy after 3 years. Apart from that, he has developed into a boy who is observant and shows interest in many things that are around him that has also helped in turning him into a more outgoing person. His frequent questions and enquiries on his surroundings have also contributed to his creative mind because Mindchamps has provided many opportunities for Asher to grow up at his own pace but not forgetting to assist him step outside his comfort zone. In term of cognitive development, Asher has enhanced in language skills especially in English when he learned a lot of vocabulary, syntax and communicative skills through the well-designed syllabus that Mindchamps has developed for the kids. Most importantly, Asher is not a great user of Mandarin but his Mandarin has improved tremendously for the past years, allowing him to be able to communicate more effectively with others. Asher always compliments and enjoys the story telling sessions by the teachers in Mindchamps and he always comes back home telling us what he has learned from the story telling sessions. Sharing has not been his strength but Mindchamps makes him a better one and also builds him to be a conscientious person plus an all-rounder. We are looking forward to see more greatness in him as he progresses to K2.",0.2591049382716049,5,"['asher', 'mindchamps', 'boy', 'great', 'tell', 'develop', 'person', 'outgoing', 'story', 'learn', 'year', 'mandarin', 'term', 'session', 'skill', 'send', 'cognitive', 'strength', 'effectively', 'frequent']",MindChamps PreSchool @ Holland Village

"Time flies so fast. In the blink of an eye, this is already Jiayi‚Äôs last year at Mindchamps. In more than four years, she has grown from a babbling baby to a lively and cheerful girl. School has a great attraction for her. Every morning when she wakes up, she wants to go to school as soon as possible. When she picks her up every day, she ""complains"" about why her mother comes so early and she is reluctant to go home. Fortunately, every teacher at school gave her enough patience and tolerance, and helped her grow better in her study and life. When Jiayi comes back, she often talks about the gentle and patient Mother Zhou, the cheerful and enthusiastic Miss YuSing, the serious and responsible Ji Laoshi, the meticulous Teacher Frances, the humorous Teacher Klement, the talented Teacher Hui Sin, the story-telling Teacher Jasmine... too many The teacher helped her become a better version of herself. Jiayi is a child with a lot of personality, and her thinking is relatively mature. She often shares her anecdotes at school with us like a little adult, and often borrows the words of teachers or parents to argue with us. She likes to ask more and more ""why"" when it comes to learning. She likes to read books, listen to stories, and share the knowledge she learned in school. When getting along with her friends, she likes to share every detail of life with the children, and she also learns to be polite and humble and actively help others. In life, she is a veritable ""little housekeeper"". While doing her own thing well, she also worries about all the things around her. Sometimes she often brings us unexpected surprises. She likes the study tour activities organized by the school, which can help her broaden her horizons and increase her knowledge. We are very happy to see Jiayi‚Äôs growth, and we are very grateful to the school and teachers for their efforts. We also hope that she can better enrich herself in the remaining time. Kindergarten is her first step in contacting the society. We are very happy and Let‚Äôs work together with Mindchamps to describe her best moments and leave her with the most unforgettable memories!""",0.3286174242424242,4,"['teacher', 'school', 'like', 'help', 'jiayi', 'well', 'come', 'life', 'learn', 'share', 'grow', 'happy', 'knowledge', 'little', 'mother', 'time', 'thing', 'year', 'cheerful', 'child']",MindChamps PreSchool @ Holland Village

"My daughter (now in K1) has been at this school since playgroup and my son just started playgroup this year. Enrolling my son was an easy decision seeing how my daughter has blossomed over the years at mindchamps. The smaller class sizes ensure that students get personalised attention from teachers, who are truly invested in their learning. Lessons, while conducted within the theme/topic for the term, are nonetheless adjusted to the children‚Äôs interests, ensuring that the children remain excited to keep on learning. Indeed, the teachers make mindchamps special. It is clear from conversations with them that they are extremely dedicated to their craft and caring for the children, not just the children in the class they teach but the children across all levels. My son‚Äôs current teacher, who also taught my daughter in her nursery years, still interacts with my daughter regularly and provides me with feedback. My daughter‚Äôs teachers are also constantly looking out for my son and providing me with updates on how he is adjusting to school. I‚Äôm ever grateful and thankful to my mindchamps village for providing such a safe and loving environment for my children to learn and grow. The school has certainly gone through rough patches with higher teacher and principal turnover.

"This preschool has inept, unresponsive franchise owners, whose poor management has caused high staff turnover and distrust from many parents. Our child was with MindChamps Thomson Chinese Preschool for K1 and K2, graduating in 2023. We chose this school as we wanted a Mandarin-immersion programme near our home. While our child had good teachers throughout the two years there, unfortunately, the school was very poorly managed. During this period, 4 principals resigned (the 5th principal will be starting in late-Jan 2024), along with all 6 of our child‚Äôs teachers. What is worse is that these 6 teachers left with little to no notice period given to the parents or children. This is despite the management being aware that they resigned several months ahead of time. They deliberately required the teachers not to tell the parents, giving no time for a proper farewell and showing little regard for the relationship between the teachers and the children. The school environment was therefore very unstable, making it difficult for children to form a relationship of trust with their teachers. Just imagine how your child would feel if they started trusting a teacher, only to see her suddenly depart, time after time. During the first wave of resignations in 2022, we were among a group of 9 families who collectively wrote a letter to the franchise owners to express our grave concern. We were deeply dissatisfied with the high staff turnover and their decision to announce the teachers‚Äô departure at very short notice (i.e. 1 day before her last day). Notably, the owners did not bother to respond to us at all. Instead, the new principal tried to assure us she would right the ship. She worked hard and seemed sincere, but soon resigned as well. While we certainly considered changing school, eventually we kept our child there because of the existing friendships and the new teachers were good. It‚Äôs also rather disruptive to change school with just a year to go. The K2 year was more stable ‚Äì we thought the management had finally met minimal standards. Unfortunately, that was not to be the case. In mid-December 2023, both the K2 teachers left the school abruptly. Once again, the management kept the news from us until 3 days before the teachers‚Äô final day. This was baffling, given that the parents had already paid the school fees for December, so they could have given more time to allow the children to process the end of these treasured relationships. From these actions, it is clear that the franchise owners of MindChamps Thomson are lacking in management and people skills. Worse, they do not listen to feedback. Principals did not stay more than 6 months, they could not explain the decisions of the franchise owners, and good teachers left very suddenly, in an unnecessarily disruptive manner. We have no confidence in the franchise owners, and believe parents should know about their history before deciding to enrol. Ultimately, while the teachers are good and committed, the preschool management is not child-centric. Here is a final example: MindChamps Thomson scheduled the K2 graduation concert on 3 December, obviously to get parents to pay for that month‚Äôs enrolment. Several families planned to travel in Dec to visit family overseas etc and thus appealed to have the concert earlier. However, the management rejected the appeal. As a result, several children were not allowed to join the graduation concert, even if their parents were willing to pay the $373 concert/graduation package. This is simply mean and profit-obsessed. Most other preschools hold their graduation concerts in November, and even October. We think teachers, parents and children deserve much better.",0.0693823831535696,2,"['teacher', 'child', 'parent', 'school', 'management', 'owner', 'concert', 'time', 'franchise', 'good', 'preschool', 'principal', 'graduation', 'day', 'give', 'pay', 'leave', 'resign', 'mindchamps', 'relationship']",MindChamps Chinese PreSchool @ Thomson

"Kids learn faster than adults and, being 50% Chinese, I believe it is essential that our children be exposed to the Chinese culture and language early on. This will enable them to tap into the advantages of being proficient in one of the most widely spoken languages in the world today. We were concerned initially whether our child would feel overwhelmed being thrown into a new environment with a new language. However, young children adapt quickly and before we knew it, he started acquiring new vocabulary and was responsive when I communicated with him in Mandarin. Since he started attending school at MindChamps Chinese PreSchool @ Thomson, he learned many words, both in Mandarin and English.

Her creative teaching methods and ability to connect with children make learning enjoyable and meaningful.

"Our girl‚Äôs PG to K2 journey in MC Punggol is coming to an end this month and it has been an extremely enriching experience for her. We could see significant improvements in her behavior in the past 2 years and the MC Punggol team deserves a shoutout for it. Regular updates on our girl‚Äôs development from the app, parent-teacher meetings and quick 5-minute chats with teachers after school has been very helpful as it allows us to ‚Äúcontinue‚Äù the learning with our child at home. Post-Covid, the school began to resume a lot of activities such as farm visits (crocodile, fish, goat, vegetable etc.), excursions (Changi Experience Studio), outdoor activities (Splash @ Kidz Amaze), Sports Day and cultural celebrations to make learning fun and enjoyable at the same time. As parents we also looked forward to taking part in some of these activities with our kids. The curriculum in my opinion is quite well-balanced and focuses on different areas of development. While preparation for Primary 1 is important, the champs also spend substantial time on learning various musical instruments (violin!), arts and crafts, cultural diversity and outdoor activities to stimulate development in other areas and build up their character. Our girl was fortunate to be taught by several wonderful and dedicated teachers who are always looking out for her. The principal Veron, form teachers Mr. Tze and Êù®ËÄÅÂ∏à constantly updated us on her meltdowns in school and this helped us greatly in correcting her behavioral issues. Mr. Tze's encouraging and motivating attitude is really ""contagious"" and we could see our girl being influenced positively by him. Êü¥ËÄÅÂ∏à, whom we know so well by now and possibly the active longest-serving teacher there, will personally watch over her whenever she has her bad days and calm her down. Jerome and Katherine have also been proactive in sharing feedback on our girl‚Äôs development in music and reading. Our boy who is in Nursery was assigned to the young and vibrant pair of Â∞èÊÅ© and Tiffany who could match his energy levels and we could feel their genuine attachment to the toddlers under them from their dedication and efforts towards the preparation for the Year-End Musical showcase. Location wise, the school may not be conveniently accessible but having its own little gym, library, and outdoor playground more than makes up for it. It can be quite a pain during wet weather as the walkway from the main road bus stop to the school is unsheltered. To sum it up, MC Punggol team really outdone themselves in making the 2 biggest events of the year, the Family Fiesta and the Year-End Musical, a great success. I believe a lot of parents were touched by the performances and proud of their champs. The hours spent on choreographing the dance, rehearsals, handmaking the costumes and props is a testament to the passion and dedication of the whole MC Punggol team under the leadership of Veron. We are really grateful to the teachers who will be departing the school after leading the champs through these milestones in their preschool journey and for the positive impact on them. I would not hesitate to recommend MC Punggol to parents who are looking for a preschool and willing to pay more for the higher education standards and conducive environment. PS: We were impressed by Sheryl's attentiveness to my dad's condition and for taking the initiative to change my parents' seats for the Musical.

"I speak from the experience of being a father of two who are attending Mindchamps Punggol Northshore, and this is my honest opinion of the establishment. Location wise it might not be the most convenient to some, but the environment and infrastructure together with real estate space more than makes up for it. I have been impressed by the general state of cleaniness and hygiene control of the school whenever I visit the place, and the seemingly much lower rates of HFMD/Influenza spreads within the school is probably a good tesitmony of that. While as with every establishment we cannot expect the quality of every single teacher to be of the highest standard of excellence, I have observed that generally most if not all of the staffs have displayed a good level of understanding with regards to how they should effectively carry themselves in various situations. It is clear that training is prioritized on a management level for that to be achieved (think Hai Di Lao, but for schools). A huge plus point is it's not uncommon to see staffs who are truly passionate about what they do and enjoy being surrounded by kids. Annoyance or irritation from the staff is an extremely rare sight if any. I am impressed by how most of the staff make the effort to know every child's name and even attempt to build rapport with each of everyone of them. It's comforting to know that there are multiple staffs and teachers who approach their work with their hearts daily. I do not think this would be possible without the likes of Ms Veron, Mr Jerome and Cai Laoshi (to name a few but there's more), who have definitely helped in creating a healthy culture and environment within the establishment for children to grow and shine in. I dare confidently say that most children who graduate from Mindchamps Punggol Northshore will enjoy a headstart in their primary school journey.

"I'm a parent of 2 kids who are currently in this branch for about 4 years and lucky to have found this branch for our kids. The branch has a strong curriculum and always has the kids' well-being as their priority. While there is a strong curriculum in place, they also teach based on the class's interest. This is important to sustain kids' curiosity in learning. For example for N1 classes learning about farm animals, The teachers will hold conversations with the kids and find out their interests. With this, class A would have a slightly different aspect from class B based on their kid's interests. With the opening up from covid situation, they have increased their excursions, such as theatre play, goat farm, crocodile farms as well! The kids enjoyed themselves a lot. The teachers are dedicated and always go above and beyond their primary responsibility. They always provide timely and valuable feedback on your kids and allow parents to know how they are in school, etc. The principal and admin staff are very responsive as well. All in all, I would say that this branch is indeed a flagship branch of mind champ where they have a good curriculum, good systems and processes, good teachers, and admin staff.

"I had a negative experience with MindChamps. I registered, paid a deposit, and two months' fees to secure a promotional rate during registration. I completed all required forms and waited for my daughter's class to begin in less than two months. However, about two to three weeks after registration, I received a call informing me of a fee increase. The staff told me that if I do not agree with the increment, I can choose to withdraw and they will refund fully. But this was not what I was initially told during sign-up. I'm aware that I'm not the only parent affected by this. MindChamps did not honor their promise, and the principal unashamedly mentioned a clause that is ‚Äòallowing them to change terms and conditions without notice‚Äô, which left me stunned. Their sales tactic was to lock in a special 12-month fee promotion during the special registration period. I find MindChamps Singapore's actions disappointing and unacceptable. But anyway, thanks to their management, this turned out to be a blessing in disguise for us. I'm extremely relieved that my child is not part of this school.

However, it seems that the curriculum is not aligned with the one conveyed on the PCF website.

Elise was relatively sensitive and shy before enrolled in Mindchamps, significant improvement noticed by us that she became very confident and teachable. She is so happy now in primary school as she is learning effortlessly and initiatively. Special Thanks to Xiaohui Laoshi.

"Recently relocated to Sengkang and was looking for a preschool for my daughter who were entering her PG stage. Had a tour visit here in MindChamps Buangkok @ Popular Building and decided this is where my elder daughter starts her PG journey. I am not the most hardworking daddy at home to sing her songs or read her books but she always came home with surprises - she learnt tons of words and multiple gestures during the 4 months, so far. My daughter loves to go to school and having a lovely relationshipn with the teachers, and what amazed me, is not limited to only her class teachers ! I can feel the love from teachers given to my daughter and I am grateful I made the right decision 4 months ago! Special shoutout to Ms Shannon to assure me that during my daughter can definitely be adapting here in the school, especially during first few days. And not forgetting Ms Stella for being helpful and always welcome my daughter in her most cheerful smile ! P/S : I visited many preschools and this is the one with lots of free parking ( at least 15 ) right in front of the building drop off. As a parents, preschools with complicated or limited parking can be a hassle especially you are rushing to work.",0.20728021978021982,3,"['daughter', 'teacher', 'preschool', 'ms', 'right', 'parking', 'pg', 'visit', 'home', 'building', 'especially', 'school', 'month', 'love', 'rush', 'lot', 'daddy', 'decide', 'day', 'stage']",MindChamps PreSchool @ Buangkok (Serangoon North)
"Definitely a great place for your kids to have fun and learn at the same time. Enrolled my child into Mindchamp Buangkok for PG class and we were amazed at the rate she has grown and developed. A safe and comfortable environment where school goes the extra mile to ensure safety for the kids (strict protocols in place for visitors and child friendly fixtures and fittings) and sanitisation being done at common area regularly. Artworks done by the child were displayed around the school to showcase and create inviting environment for the child when they enter school compound. Dedicated and inspiring teachers who spent extra efforts in decorating the classrooms to fit the theme of the lesson plan. Regular update are sent to parents on the development progress of the child with reports and pictures. A good mixture of engaging, fun and systematic curriculums allows the child to get hands on experiences where my child enjoyed very much. Though there are no outdoor area within the school, there is a huge gym area for their lessons and there are also the monthly excursions for the child to explore and relate their classroom learnings to real life experience. The principal and administrative staff are also very accommodating and responsive to the needs of the parents. Besides the class teachers, the school principal also makes effort to speak to parents during drop off and pick up timings to strengthen the school and parents partnership in developing the child. With the positive development on my elder child, my younger child will also commence school at Mindchamp Buangkok shortly. Having seen and heard a lot of stories from my friends enrolling their child at other places, I‚Äôm confident to recommend that MC Buangkok is a place where you can enrol your child to with no regrets!",0.22757836990595615,3,"['child', 'school', 'parent', 'place', 'buangkok', 'area', 'enrol', 'experience', 'extra', 'development', 'class', 'develop', 'teacher', 'fun', 'environment', 'principal', 'classroom', 'kid', 'mindchamp', 'effort']",MindChamps PreSchool @ Buangkok (Serangoon North)

"Our daughter commenced her journey at Mindchamps Buangkok (""MCBKK"") since N1 way back in early 2019. She participated and we just attended her K2 graduation ceremony 3 weeks back and she will be leaving Mindchamps as a confident and articulate ""K3"" to start her P1 formal education very shortly. During the course of the last 4 years, both my wife and I have much to thank the whole team at MCBKK principle, teachers and support staff. It is inevitable that there will always be turnover for any childcare though I know MCBKK will try their best to retain and replace. Kids are also more resilient than what most parents think and adapt quickly. Nonetheless as I reflect, would I have trusted my daughter with MCBKK all over again? The answer is a definite ""yes' for the following reasons. - Great partnership between parents and entire MCBKK team, bus driver and bus auntie included. - Genuine and professional teachers and staff who really care and bother - Clean, bright and cheerful environment - Holistic educational experience that covers English, Chinese, Math, reading, writing, physical education, art, gourmet, performance and music just to name some. - Honest and timely feedback from teachers - Supportive fellow parents and wonderful classmates Covid was a trying period for all of us and I could appreciate the amount of consideration, stress and work that went behind as the MCBKK team tried to maintain a safe and healthy environment for the kids while keeping up with their programme. Special mention Ms Ng, Ms Yun, Ms Shannon, Ms Mabel, Ms Beth, Ms Amanda, Ms Cass, Ms Fu, Ms Stella and ex-teachers Ms Eileen and Ms Zhang Qian. A big Thank You to all of you! All of you have been instrumental in one way or another for our child's growing up journey. We are always grateful and appreciative and definitely like to share our gratitude and experience with any parents who are currently in their taunting process of selecting a pre-school for their little ones.

They take it more personal and are soo involved in the child's development .

"After months of searching for a preschool for my daughter, I have finally found Mindchamps Buangkok to be our preferred choice in this neighborhood. Likely to be one of the best that offers an all-rounded curriculum and one with personalized feedback . We have seen a significant progression in our daughter's learning journey since she was transferred from another preschool at N1 last year. One example is that my daughter is able to recognise her name and write it independently now. Kudos to the dedicated team that Principal Shannon leads. Their parent-teacher communication is clear and also insightful in understanding our daughter's personal growth, which is helpful to her growth not only in school but also at home. The school also organizes monthly field trips that align with its curriculum, which is fantastic because the kids not only learn within a classroom setting but also experience it in a more practical setting. Special shout out to the teachers, Ms. Kym, Fu laoshi, Ren laoshi, Ms. Cass, and Ms. Beverley & supporting staff for making my daughter, Klary, preschool's journey a fulfilling one.",0.22388392857142858,0,"['daughter', 'preschool', 'teacher', 'curriculum', 'school', 'journey', 'laoshi', 'learn', 'growth', 'fantastic', 'beverley', 'shout', 'year', 'able', 'field', 'understand', 'finally', 'fulfil', 'recognise', 'good']",MindChamps PreSchool @ Buangkok (Serangoon North)

There are a number of facilities within the school: indoor playground, water playground, gym and music class. The centre head Mr Desmond gave a good introduction to the school and he was very patient at answering questions. The curriculum sounded really good so we decided to enrol our son in.

Thankfully the school was able to accommodate us and let our boy in earlier by a month. Thank you to vice principal Ms Alice for helping us with this urgent request. We appreciate this very much. I accompanied my boy for his first 2 days of school and found that the teachers there are really nurturing and dedicated. As my boy has not attended school before, I was initially worried about him adapting to school life. My boy‚Äôs class teachers Ms Jocelyn Tan and ÈÉ≠ËÄÅÂ∏à were very assuring. Following through the class, I could see that they are very caring and engaged with the children really well. They also took time to report on my child‚Äôs status and the activities they carried out.

"Beware the $70 waitlist. It's a great education facility, but if it's a full-house for your kid's level, they may ask you to pay $70 to be added to a waitlist. ** Read this then make up your mind** If it was a waitlist that works like normal waitlists (a vacancy becomes available, next-in-line gets a slot), then great! But I'm aware of people who have managed to cut queue without even joining the waitlist at all. Same level as my kid, same full house they should have encountered. If I didn't know the kid who (unknowingly) cut the queue, I'd still be (foolishly) waiting today. If this school is knowingly taking money and not fulfilling their end of the deal, sounds like a scam to me. If there are loopholes in their system, that's plain incompetence.

"It was very nice to receive our very first termly report on our child's (TL) progress in his first 10 weeks at MindChamps. How time flies. We thought it is only apt that we would like to write this letter to express our gratitude and appreciation for all the wonderful things Ms Arina and ÂÜØËÄÅÂ∏à have done as preschool teachers. Their passion, dedication, and commitment to shaping the minds and lives of young children is truly admirable, and we are grateful for the positive impact they have had on our little one. From the moment little TL started attending their class, it was clear that they are not just a teacher, but also a caring and nurturing mentor They have a gift for making every child feel valued, heard, and supported, which is so important in building their confidence and self esteem. Their patience, kindness, and enthusiasm have helped our little TL develop a love for learning and a sense of curiosity about the world around him. He would come home singing the songs he learned ""Ee i ee I o.."". We can tell how attached he is towards Ms Arina and ÂÜØËÄÅÂ∏à. They would patiently coax him to nap and have their ways of comforting him. Their creativity and imagination in designing age appropriate activities and lessons have made learning fun and engaging for him. We are constantly amazed by the projects and crafts little TL works on (from the many photos shared by both teachers), and how much he has grown in his cognitive and motor skills. Their abilities to tailor their teaching to each child's unique needs and learning style is truly remarkable, and we are grateful for the individual attention and care they give to him. As parents, we know that we can trust them to provide a safe and nurturing environment for our little one. Their communication and collaboration with us have been invaluable in keeping us informed about little TL's progress and development. We truly appreciate their willingness to listen to our concerns and feedback, and to provide suggestions and work with us in supporting his growth and development. On a special note, we would also like to extend our appreciation to Èí±ËÄÅÂ∏à whose presence is always able to calm little TL down at the daily morning reception. Many times, she would be sharp to notice his eyes welling up and will always be able to provide comfort and a change of emotions in him (and probably in us parents too). In short, we would like to thank them for being exceptional preschool teachers. Their impact on our little one's life and education will be felt for years to come, and we are forever grateful for the role they have played in shaping his future.

"We started our firstborn at Mindchamps J10 since Playgroup, and the curriculum has exposed her to opportunities for a holistic growth in the domains of language, cognitive development and socio-emotional skills. The school also provides a conducive environment for learning with its well thought-out and organized classrooms and facilities. She returns home excitedly every day and shares with us the activities and experiences she has gone through in school. Not only has she formed strong friendships with her classmates (us parents have formed great friendships too!), but also developed good rapport with her supportive teachers and even non-teaching staff. Communication between parents and teachers has always been transparent and prompt with the Mindchamps app, as we are constantly updated with our child‚Äôs progress and well-being in school. Her increasing independence and curiosity stand as evidence of the effectiveness of Mindchamp‚Äôs pedagogical approach and the professionalism of J10‚Äôs teaching team. Our secondborn started his school journey in July 2023. At just slightly over 6 months, we have noticed remarkable progress in his language, numeracy, and social interaction skills.

As their playground is located out of the mall, We were worried that it might be too noisy.. so we went to check the traffic condition at several timing, and to our surprise, only peak hours about 5.30-6pm there was an increase of traffic. We also like how they communicate effectively with parents in their own school app. I get to see updates like - what time my girl enters school, temperature checking and more. So much thought and effort is put into the educational activities as well. I know my daughter loves being here, and i wouldn't take her anywhere else. We‚Äôre so happy with our decision.

"My elder daughter started with MC @J10 since it 1st opened up in 2015. In a flash of an eye, 6yrs had passed and now my younger daughter is going to spend her last year in MC in 2022. I'm happy to see how my girls had developed overall throughout the years they had been in the centre (not just in studies, but even in the soft skills like leadership, adaptability, problem solving and social cohesiveness). We had always found the teachers and directors at MC @J10 to be approachable and genuine in wanting to care for the children under them (maybe we were just blessed that my 2 girls had great teachers). I had observed how improvements were made to the infrastructure over the years. I had seen the outdoor playground get refurbished into a garden area before a new playground was added as well. This makes water play so much more meaningful when we still remember how it originally was. With the addition of the Allied care centre below, I have no doubt that the centre's management is looking towards providing awesome care for a larger spectrum of children (including those who might need additional assistance to integrate better into mainstream education). Kudos to their foresight and planning! Here's to wishing MC @J10 and it's teaching staffs many more fantastic years ahead, creating better futures for our future generations!

Mindchamps provides a conducive environment for Isaac to learn and grow over the years ‚Äì he picked up social skills quickly and displays proficiency in both Mandarin and English (yes he even challenges our vocabulary now!) and it is evident he has a great love for music and reading. We especially appreciate the hard work put in by the teachers and staff at MindChamps J10 during the Covid period when classes were conducted online and regular updates were provided to parents through the Mindchamps app with lots of pictures and curriculum details. And the teachers put in a lot of effort to give us a detailed write up of what Isaac learns every term, not just in English but also in Chinese. We are very glad that we can share photos of what Isaac does in school everyday with his grandparents as well! Now Isaac looks forward to going to school every morning (Not just because of Fun Toast!) but he tells us that he looks forward to seeing his teachers and friends ‚Äì so much so he wants to stay back after school hours to continue playing with his classmates.

He is no longer afraid of pronouncing the word wrongly, and takes it as a challenge and enjoys the fun of learning. Since playgroup until K2, on a weekly basis, kyler has to bring back English and Chinese reading books provided by the school. And everyweek without fail, we would read with him. This has become a reading habit for kyler and us to read and bond together through the book section.

"MindChamps Preschool fully embodies the elements that both my wife and I were looking for when we were looking for a school for Athena. We had a tour within the school compound, and we spoke to the staffs about a possible enrolment which left us hugely impressed with the level of detail and assurance that they have given to us. Without a doubt, we signed up for Athena on the spot. The school environment is very clean, organized, and well-thought out. It provides a conducive learning and safe playing environment for the children. The curriculum not only develops the child in academics, but it enhances their motor, emotional, musical, and social interaction abilities as well. This is truly a holistic way of nurturing our children as they advance through their early childhood. Athena started her journey with MindChamps J10 in January 2021. At just slightly over a year mark, we have noticed remarkable progress in Athena‚Äôs language, numeracy, and social interaction skills. From the early days of reaching the school entrance in tears to where we are today, she is loving and enjoying every little moment that she has spent in school. Almost every other day, she would ecstatically return home and explain to us in great length on what she has done for the day. We were also pleasant to find that she has developed a good rapport with her class and several strong friendships within her classmates. It makes her day in school even more fulfilling. Communication between the staffs and parents are transparent and prompt. Through digital means such as the MindChamps App and email, we are constantly being updated with our child‚Äôs progress and school matters.

At pickup, he would be his usual cheerful self telling us about his day, what he ate, what he did etc. We really appreciate the attention that has been provided to him by everyone in school, and more importantly see how he has notably gown into someone with confidence and exemplary speech capability. We are so happy to have our son start his learning journey with Mindchamps from his forming years.

"My daughter joined Mindchamp with her good friend when she was in K1. In the blink of an eye, it was time for her to graduate. Every day when she came home from school, she would happily share with me what happened at school today and what kind of food she cooked at school. She would also confidently tell me that she would teach me on the weekend. Make, the most delicious food in the world that I learned to make in school today, etc. These sharings let me know that she has a fulfilling life at school every day, has a group of good friends, and has great teachers, so I can trust my daughter to the school. Of course, occasionally, my daughter will be unhappy at school, and she will tell me what happened, why she was unhappy, the teacher's reaction, etc. Every time I see the teacher handle it very fairly, which makes me feel at ease. K2 The school organized many activities this year to allow children to better connect with kindergarten and primary school, such as visiting Zhenhua Primary School, learning to recognize coins, etc. It allows my daughter and the children in the class to understand what primary school will look like in the future, and also gives them full confidence and expectations for primary school learning. Through various activities in the school, the parents of the classmates also become familiar with each other and become a big family, communicating with each other and growing together. I am very happy that my daughter is learning and growing happily in this big MindChamp family, learning how to face difficulties and how to share happiness.

"In the blink of an eye, our daughter Moxi has happily spent her K2 life under the careful care of two teachers at MC J10, and will enter elementary school next year. With their hard work and thoughtful care, the child is growing up day by day. We can truly feel the changes in her bit by bit. We are really happy and grateful in our hearts. It has been almost half a year since the child was in the internship. After this year of study and life, he has learned a lot of knowledge and learned how to be humble, cooperative and helpful in activities with children. She also has more valuable language skills, imagination, curiosity and enterprising spirit... All of this is attributed to our teachers. From the careful arrangement of daily recipes, from the meticulous weekly teaching arrangements, and from the honors children receive every time. We know: In order to give your children a good enlightenment education and for their continuous growth, you have been working hard. Parents are very happy to see their children‚Äôs gains in the past six months and encourage their children to actively participate in various activities and stage performances to help them learn how to improve their performance skills and abilities. Thanks to MC Kindergarten for attaching great importance to educating children‚Äôs comprehensive qualities.

It says a lot about the overall vibe and cheerful environment that is truly unique to this school. She graduated in 2021 and moved on to primary school and I must say that mindchamp nc2 teachers prep their graduates very well for transitioning to primary school (spelling, show n tell, numerical etc).

He took around 2 weeks to get used to morning routine of going to school. Beyond that on most days, he does not struggle going to school. We saw him grew tremendously in term of language skill, motor skill, social skill, music skill etc. We were so thankful that it was his teacher who potty trained him successfully while we as parent were struggling to train him at home. From the very start he joined, the school teachers has kept very open and transparent communications in partnering with us as parents handling the various request and feedback.

"As a first time parent sending our child to a preschool, we had of course, all the worries ahead of us such as if our child can get used to the environment and his teachers. Though the beginning was quite a challenge for us at drop offs, we were assured by Nicol and her team of teachers with occasional photo updates of our son in school via text messages. Foremost, we are truly grateful for all the teachers in the campus, their dedication and patience (especially) is truly admirable. On some days when my son whines at drop offs, any teachers who came across me would gladly receive my son over, and it seems that my child knows every of the teachers in the centre and willingly allow them to carry over albeit emotional. The focus in ensuring every child enters the school on a positive morning is visibly rendered on a professional level, proven with the team work that came along with this observation. We are truly thankful to Ms Cyn, Chen Lao shi and Wang lao shi for being the primary influence of our son‚Äôs inaugural school experience.

"I cannot recommend Mindchamps @Upper Thomson enough for parents looking for a more engaging and nurturing environment for their little ones. My daughter enrolled there when she was 18 months old. She was very shy, so teachers must have made a tremendous effort to make my daughter feel safe and secure there very quickly. My daughter has developed many skills and learned so much during her time at school, from eating and sleeping on her own, socializing with her peers, to learning her colors, shapes, and numbers etc in both English and Chinese. The music, dance, and drama lessons at this preschool offer a great introduction for us to discover our daughter's interests and talents. Mr Alim, Ms Misellya and Mr Nas did an amazing job to make these lessons so enjoyable. The school also offers weekly reading program and monthly outing program, which we find very enriching and interesting. What sets this preschool apart, though, is the staff's dedication to each child's individual needs and personalities. The PG class size is so small (teacher to student ratio is 2:6) that teachers take the time to get to know each child and tailor their care and education accordingly. My daughter adores her class teachers- Ms Nor & Lin Laoshi, who are both very passionate and responsive and understand my daughter's needs perfectly. They communicate with us on a daily basis, providing updates and feedback that give us peace of mind and help us support our daughter's development at home.

"Before choosing MindChamps, I visited other schools for comparison. Ultimately, I chose MindChamps Woodlands for several main reasons: 1:The school's core value is respecting children with zero intimidation. as a mother, this was my top priority. 2:The educational philosophy of the school's 10 core values attracted me. 3:MindChamps Woodlands is directly affiliated with the MindChamps headquarters. 4:The school environment is great, very comfortable, and clean. 5:The transparent curriculum planning and the careful selection of food for children made me feel more assured. Without hesitation, I chose MindChamps Woodlands. after my child started at this kindergarten, I felt reassured (i still rmb i was crying together with my son in the first few days to school.). The school's app updates on child's situations time to time daily. Most importantly, my child enjoys going to school. despite relocating (the new home being about an hour's drive from MindChamps Woodlands), we visited new MindChamps schools with the intent to transfer. However, my child firmly insists on staying at MindChamps Woodlands with their teachers and classmates. i always believe that the child's heart is pure, and I believe their choice follows their innermost preference. although it's tough, both my hubby and I respect our child's choice. This little boy strives not to be late for school every day, waking up between 6:50-7:00 am consistently for over half a year. Whenever I ask about his favorite teacher or subject, he always says, I love all the teachers, and I enjoy all the subjects.' But he especially loves the time spent in MindGym and MindSpace. Witnessing my child's joyful anticipation of going to school every day is the happiest moment when sending him to school. Many friends send their children for English tuition, but I feel at MindChamps, I witnessed my child's gradual transformation, not aiming for the best, but improving every day,day by day,bit by bit. This is what I have seen and been most moved by in my child. The MRW and ReadAlong app at MindChamps make it unnecessary for us, a non-English-speaking family, to provide additional tutoring. Of course, this varies from person to person. However, at this stage, I've seen this in my child, and we allow him to progress at his own pace. Over the years, MindChamps Woodlands and all the teachers have given my child warmth, care, and guidance, nurturing him bit by bit from a small boy into a confident, warm, and sunny big boy.

Lessons such as the show-and-tell sessions, Creativity and Theatrical Strategies have allowed her to build up her confidence and presentation skills.

She also enjoys her MindChamps Music lessons where she has learnt to play the recorder, violin, keyboard and other musical instruments. During Gourmet Moments, she has learnt about food preparation, nutrition, and different cuisines, and is proud to bring home the dish she has prepared in school.

"As a parent, I have carefully reviewed all the comments. I must objectively state that this school indeed has many issues, and I do not recommend parents to enroll their children here. Firstly, there has been an excessively high turnover of teachers over the past two years. Except for a few senior staff members, the entire teaching staff leaves every year. Secondly, due to the frequent turnover of teachers, children have a very hard time adapting to the school. This has led parents to lose confidence in the school. In summary, this is not a trustworthy school, and in recent years, the school leadership has turned a blind eye to this. The teachers I have come into contact with who left were all highly professional and dedicated. I believe that if it weren't for the extremely poor working environment, no teacher would want to leave.

"My boy started with TCC in Dec‚Äô20 to do ICCP in 2021. From little to no verbal speech and a very short attention span, in a short period of time he showed vast improvements in receptive language, and he was able to do the given worksheets. The teachers also gave him the appropriate support and encouragement when guiding him with his fine motor ie. penmanship and coloring. They conduct their lesson in a small group setting in K1 which benefits children with special needs (SN) or those who need more assistance in learning progressively. The school is very inclusive for children with SN and the other children in the school are also taught how to help their friends with challenges. No child is excluded from any school activities, performances, field trips or ‚Äúcamping‚Äù in school. For example, the teachers choreographed the graduation dance and taught my boy to dance in a way that he could manage, even getting classmates to support him in moving around during the dance. It is an incredible honor for my child to have the opportunity to experience being in a performance. I salute the teachers' spirit of never giving up on any child. Teachers are always open to listening and discussing with us how they can better support our boy. They even go the extra mile to get stickers and books of his interest to motivate and reward him. Aunties were so sweet as well - they would do takeaway fruits or afternoon tea breaks for items that he likes if we need to bring him home earlier. It was such a memorable experience for our boy to do a sleepover in school with his classmate before they graduate. He was even appointed to present the token of appreciation to the GOH during graduation. It is an incredible opportunity for him to be trusted with this responsibility. Under the leadership of Ms Candice, the children care community is like a big family. It is also so heartwarming that all the teachers are involved during the first in-person graduation since 2019.

"The best decision we made when we enrolled our boy, Javen, at TWLC for his preschool education. Teachers were caring, nurturing and truly passionate in what they were doing. Every child was given opportunities to excel and realise his/her own potential. Curriculum was well-rounded, exposing the children to various domains like Science, Art, Music & Dance and Languages. The quarterly learning journeys were not only fun but enriching as well. Teachers were receptive to feedback and had an open communication with parents. We always felt at ease and welcomed to speak with the teachers whenever we had any concerns about Javen. When we moved house and were considering switching Javen out of TWLC so that we did not have to travel back to Woodlands, we faced difficulties in finding another school nearby which could match what TWLC could offer and with reasonable school fees. So we stayed on, despite having to travel further. That is how high the standard at TWLC is - it gives us the assurance that our children are in safe hands. Thanks to TWLC for laying a strong foundation, Javen had no problems transitioning to Primary School. He has consistently been performing well from P1 to P5.

"As a long-established private kindergarten in Singapore, PATS‚Äôs brand quality does not need to be elaborated. I chose pats sembawang country club campus mainly because of its following advantages: 1. Have your own outdoor activity area and the teachers do take the children outdoors on non-rainy days: at least 2 hours of outdoor activities a day are the best protection for children‚Äôs eyes, so I put outdoor conditions first when choosing a kindergarten. First consideration. As well as the school's own play facilities, the school also shares some facilities with the golf club, such as the swimming pool, and the children have two water days each month. 2. Rich extra-school activities: There are actually plenty of activities for children to learn and play in school, but the school also carefully arranges some out-of-school activities, such as taking the children to the stadium to experience football, playing with excavators, and experiencing Experiencing Chinese opera and so on allows children to learn, feel and experience in happiness. 3. Teacher-student ratio: Compared with the ratio of 1:10 or 1:14 in many government kindergartens, the teacher-student ratio of pats sembawang is smaller. In many classes, two teachers teach 10-12 children. In Doudou class, there may be two teachers. A teacher only takes care of six or seven children, which is undoubtedly a great advantage for taking care of children's emotions and helping them adapt to school life. 4. Teacher quality: From what I have observed in the six months since my daughter entered kindergarten, all the teachers and staff at pats sembawang are friendly, polite, and enthusiastic. Before I chose this school, I took my children to the school gate to see the school. I saw that the teacher carried the children out after school, and they were still very dependent on the teacher when they were separated. When I saw that, I felt that it was a blessing to meet such a teacher. I was very lucky. Later, after my daughter entered the kindergarten, I discovered that we were also lucky, because the teachers here really like the children and are really good to them, so the children will naturally like and rely on them. 5. Convenient pick-up and drop-off: Unlike schools in shopping malls, picking up children here does not require you to worry about lack of parking spaces or being stuck in the grace period when leaving the parking lot (if you do not have a private car, you can also choose the school‚Äôs school bus service). 6. Daily communication: Through the school APP, you can see the daily updates of the children at school. Although it is not as large as some teachers who set up groups to share continuously, I prefer this method and I prefer teachers to spend more time. Spend time with your kids instead of focusing on taking photos and videos and sending instant group messages. 7. Food: I have visited many schools. I feel that since I want to send my children to kindergarten, I really have to relax. Because of religious reasons, the school does not provide red meat (pork and beef), so I can only rely on the food at home. Dinner supplement. In addition, we have to give up controlling sugar and snacks. When the children get together, it is really freeing and they are really happy. üò¨""",0.24312770562770555,3,"['school', 'child', 'teacher', 'kindergarten', 'activity', 'take', 'choose', 'experience', 'feel', 'outdoor', 'day', 'pat', 'sembawang', 'ratio', 'play', 'group', 'food', 'daily', 'advantage', 'facility']",The Schoolhouse by Busy Bees (Sembawang Country Club)

"I just moved my child out of Pats Katong branch to another new childcare in 2022. Massive disappointment of our experiences at Katong branch. My child had been with pats schoolhouse from start, past experiences with Pats Shaer (now defunct) and Pats Sembawang was fantastic with great teachers, principals, and environment where they really care for your kids. In Pats Katong branch, experiences was drastically different. -Messy hair of child when return from school -No dry of child‚Äôs hair after water play till end of the day. -Child say food given not enough, still hungry. (Apparently quantity is limited as food delivered from Katong 1 to Katong 2) -Rashes due to not cleaning up well after toilet use and teacher just looking at her outside the toilet, even when child asked for help. -Child progress updates on app by K1 teacher was just for the sake of doing, posting general pictures, no additional comments of child progress. -Whole classroom looking at video from a small monitor??? (see pic) Even smaller than my home monitor screen. Some of the above points, I still can brush it away, as might be 5 year old saying wrong things, lack of preschool teachers, lockdown, branch too big etc  But the final straw is really the poor communication of confirmed covid cases in same class. Thou they mentioned it was as per MOH protocol of 2 days after report then school will announce (I dun understand rational of this). As school did not communicate promptly, eventually is parents communicating between each other then we are aware of the situation. Worse still, entire class gotten HRN from MOH, even thou most kids DID NOT attend school most of that week. By just simply looking at check-in records, school will know exactly whom attended school but I guess admin dun even bother to check and just submit entire list to MOH. Anyway, child is happy in new childcare and instantly we can see the drastic differences in the new childcare, communication, enrolment procedures, hygiene taken when entering school etc..

"""During our relocation to Singapore, one of the most important things for us to get settled was choosing the most ideal school for our then 2.5-year-old daughter. My husband and I did countless hours of research, and I personally visited 13 different schools, and sat down with 13 different principals to understand the learning tools/ structure, and core values of each school. It wasn't until I met Natalie from Pat's Buckley that my husband and I both knew we had found the right school. Natalie was professional, personable, caring, welcoming, and very engaging.  We were also very pleased with the tour provided by Miss Gen at the time. I'm especially pleased that both Natalie and Miss Gen are receptive to parental feedback. It's so easy to see that they are dedicated in the improvement of the school's learning environment. My child‚Äôs transition to a new school in a new country was made easier under the guidance of her teachers miss Jae and Liu Laoshi. She participated in a variety of activities and events and enjoyed both her teachers and classmates. Liu Laoshi has a vibrant personality, always smiling and ready to assist.  Miss Jae is extremely caring, kind, and helpful. She is also genuinely concerned about my child‚Äôs well-being in school and always takes her time to keep me updated whenever I see her during school pick up and drop off.  My child continued to grow over the years under the patient care and guidance of Miss Jae, Miss Kristie, Guo Laoshi, and Xu Laoshi. It's especially heartwarming to see my child constantly singing and dancing to the songs that she's learnt at school from her music lessons with Miss Eunice. Fast forward a few years, my older child has graduated, and my younger child is now also attending Pat‚Äôs and loving school under the care of her teachers Miss Tina and Sun Laoshi. Every day my child is always happy to go to school and full of smiles when I pick her up. As a parent, I feel extremely grateful to be part of an institution where the leadership team and the teachers focus on the well-rounded development of a child. The current Principal Miss Gen‚Äôs warm and compassionate demeanor radiates throughout the entire school, creating an environment of kindness and respect. The teachers are equally amazing. They are passionate about teaching and care deeply about the well-being and development of every child. Their creativity and enthusiasm shine through in every activity and lesson. They have a genuine love for their students, and it shows in the way they interact with them. My family loves seeing the high level of care from the teachers, and we are grateful for the new and close friendships we've also created with some of the parents. I cannot thank the staff at Pat‚Äôs Schoolhouse Buckley enough for the incredible care, love, and education they have provided for my two kids.  Not only have they learned academic skills, but they have also developed social and emotional skills that will serve well in life. I highly recommend Pat‚Äôs Buckley to any parent looking for a safe, nurturing, and high-quality preschool.

"I have very good 2 yrs+ experience at Orange Tree Preschool and it was a pity when I have to relocate and change school this year. My kids love the school, the teachers and their friends. They always look forward to going to school. Ms Hema who is the principal cares a lot for the kids and she can remember all their names. She always smiles warmly to receive the kids and waves goodbye fondly when she sends them home. I think all the parents can really see the passion that she has for this job. And if I have any concerns, I feel comfortable to communicate it with her and she will help to address them. The admins in the school are also very nice and provide me with good support. I remembered when my 3 YO first entered school into Nursery One. She cried for the first week. Ms Hema and ËµµËÄÅÂ∏à were there to hug and console her and then she settled down pretty fast. After one week she was no longer crying. It was really heartwarming that my girl could look towards the principal and her form teacher for comfort. And the fact that she settled down after their hugs mean she trust them as well. ËµµËÄÅÂ∏à was very patient with my girl and also helped my girl to overcome her food chewing problem. I really appreciate the patience and concern that ËµµËÄÅÂ∏à put in. ËµµËÄÅÂ∏à is really a dedicated and responsible teacher. There were a lot of effort that she put in on my girl during her preschool stay to help her learning. My girl always told me at home that she loves ËµµËÄÅÂ∏à. Even now when she is in a different preschool, she says she misses ËµµËÄÅÂ∏à, Teacher Rachel and her friends. Then my boy also entered PGC and we found another gem teacher ÊõæËÄÅÂ∏à. She was good to my boy and really care a lot for him. She will give me constant updates about him. Overall I think OrangeTree is a good preschool and their environment is good for the kids. They do 2:3 days of chinese and english respectively and alternate every week. Their enrichment classes and school outings are also affordable.

The enrichment classes are at reasonable price, I can tell the improvement since my daughter started her Speech and Drama class about a year ago. She also enjoyed her Arts classes and brought back beautiful art pieces. The communication with the school and teachers is also good. The APP regularly updates the activities of the kids (with photos) which let the parents have the sense of what the kids are playing at school.

Furthermore, when my kids were absent due to illness, the teachers always call me during their lunch break to check on the kids condition, and they also call to update me whenever there‚Äôs minor injuries in school (e.g minor scratches due to kids playing).

All matters need to go through principle, yet principle knows nothing at all. No covered pick up area, children always get all wet if raining. Poor arrangement of sending in children every morning, due to less of communication, every parent wants to talk to teachers which makes the flow of sending children in to stuck! especially during COVID period, 15-20 parents and children in a 2 sq meter area for sometimes 15-20mins, not safe at all. Food is terrible, properly all students sharing 300g meat. Principle is arrogant, always blaming on children own problems. Nothing need be improved from school side. Teachers always change due to limited manpower, no one actually can understand children‚Äôs real status. Likely we left this school after 6 months bad experience. Once we confirmed to leave, child sleeves were wet almost everyday. Ask him to go toilet by himself, pants were never been worn properly! Ask principle to let teachers ask kid to drink more water due to ulcer, principle response: ‚Äúyou can choose not to send him in‚Äù Not recommend at all. Principle‚Äôs Attitude decides teacher‚Äôs attitude, which may makes the whole environment horrible.

Both joined when they were in PG) The class conducts structured lessons where my children are introduced to a thematic range of learning concepts from family to traffic to food etc. Mathematical and scientific knowledge are also included in their program through indoor experiments and outdoor exploration, where my 2 kids can pick up relevant skills from there. Teacher-parent communication is also very proactive through messaging & communication book, despite the inconvenience posed during covid period.

"My Child was badly scratched, bruised, and bitten on THREE occasions within SIX MONTHS in this Childcare. The teachers and principal did nothing to prevent bullying from happening in their childcare. They show nonchalant attitude towards all injuries during school hours, brushing it off by saying it is inevitable that such incidents happen. Incident 1: My daughter's face was badly scratched by a boy from the same class. Teacher's excuse: The boy was undergoing mood swing therefore it happen. Incident 2: My daughter's hand was bitten by a girl from the same class. There are visible wounds with bite marks on her hand. Teacher's excuse was that they are just playing and such incidents are inevitable. My daughter said she was pushed and bitten and called for help but her teachers did not stop the girl from biting her. Incident 3: My daughter's face was again badly scratched and bruised with 3 visible wounds. Incident happened between 4pm to 5pm. Teacher again did not call to inform. Their excuse: Since parents is fetching them soon, they do not see the need to call to inform. (I fetch my daughter at 6pm). To the principal Ms Sylvia, if you are reading this: Please establish a clear set of process and conduct for your teachers to follow. It is no coincidence that your childcare had so many cases of child injuries under your management. To all potential parents: Do re-consider enrolling your child into this childcare centre. I am happy to provide evidence and proof for everything I have written above.

"""Placed my child on the school‚Äôs ECDA waitlist as well as contacted the school personally. I was informed via email that vacancy priority will go to the children of Temasek Polytechnic‚Äôs staff which I fully concurred with, seeing that this school is located in the school‚Äòs premise itself. Was told to fill up a form to be placed on the waitlist which I did, and there were no other exchange of emails. I emailed the school about 6 weeks later in the afternoon just to check roughly how many children are ahead of my boy in the waitlist, so as to have a better sense of whether I should continue waiting or perhaps commit to another school further away. Approximately one hour after sending the email, my husband forwarded to me a message notification stating that my child‚Äôs interest in little skool house at TP has been removed by the centre citing no vacancy. Naturally, I was appalled and was wondering what are the odds of this being a mere coincidence? I went back to my email wondering whether I have missed out any emails but nope, nothing was sent to me. I called the school and the principal Ivy answered. She told me it was a mere coincidence and that she herself was the one who amended the ECDA list and removed him. And I was told not to worry, as despite the fact that she personally removed him from the wait list, my child remained on their personal wait list and that once again, priority goes to TP staff but they‚Äôll contact me again if there is any vacancies. This baffles me completely because it‚Äôs as good as telling me that HDB has removed us from the ballot list for a BTO house, but not to worry as they have a private list which we are supposedly still on. I told the principal that it was a very simple question. We are all adults here. Even if you can‚Äôt answer due to privacy issues, there is no need to be so passive aggressive in your action. Say I buy your story that it was sheer coincidence. Can you tell me roughly where my child is on the waitlist? And as usual, I was reiterated that TP‚Äôs staff have priority, that she despite being the principal can‚Äôt give me an answer unless she opens another class, that she can‚Äôt reveal or say anything. I was disappointed nonetheless and hanged up the phone. After which I received 3 missed calls and an email from an admin stating that she will be on leave the next day and that she will contact me via email the following day. I responded to that email citing that a waitlist only serves to exist purely because there is no vacancy in the school isn‚Äôt it? Why remove my child from the waitlist after asking us to fill up a form to join the waitlist and then cite ‚Äúno vacancy‚Äù as your reason for removal. Have all the other kids born in 2021 also been personally removed from your ECDA‚Äôs wait list (but still remained on your private wait list then)? Does it even make sense? And not surprisingly, I did not receive any email replies to my question following the staff‚Äôs one day leave. With such staffs, poor communication and questionable principal overlooking the school, there is no way I would ever trust my child to be left in their hands. Such passive aggressive action shouldn‚Äôt be coming from a preschool principal herself in a setting where I‚Äôm supposed to entrust that my child is going to be taught good values and virtues at. I won‚Äôt even go so far as to recommend this school to my enemy‚Äôs children. Should issues arise down the road, as a parent who am I supposed to turn to?

"I am writing to express my strong dissatisfaction with the recent experience I had with your institution, Little Skool House MOE.

This lack of communication and engagement with prospective parents is unacceptable and has caused significant frustration. Furthermore, when I made a phone call to your institution to seek clarification and confirmation, I was met with an impatient and discourteous attitude. I was informed in a rather dismissive manner that the school had reached its maximum capacity and was no longer accepting new students. To make matters worse, the staff member I was speaking with abruptly ended the call when I attempted to seek further clarification. While I understand that your school may be in high demand, it is essential to treat all prospective parents with respect and provide them with a response, whether or not enrollment slots are available. Failing to do so is a disservice to parents who are genuinely interested in your school and willing to invest their time and effort in the application process.

"TLH is an outstanding preschool! I highly recommend it. The principal (Mrs. Katherine) is also the founder and owner of the school. This means that she has final say of how to run the school and sees ideas thru to implementation. It is extremely valuable to have consistent leadership. She anchors and ensures that the school is run up to her high standards and principles, and based on sound research of what is best for children. The children are taught to be socially aware, responsible and considerate. These and other good habits are inculcated from day one resulting in the school having a calm and cheerful atmosphere. It‚Äôs like a home away from home. The school motto is ‚Äúhelp me help myself‚Äù. There is a focus on confidence and initiative in the context of community. Mrs. Katherine is the model of a skilled and confident person. What better way to teach confidence than to exemplify it authentically! The teachers she selects are of high quality and quite a few have been at the school for many years. This means it‚Äôs a stable environment for the children. My child often tells me how much he loves interacting with his teachers. It is a language-rich environment and I have never heard the teachers speak bad English or Mandarin. This is a mixed age Montessori school. Older children are paired with younger ones and the kids learn social graces within community, not simply in theory. Older ones learn patience, leadership and kindness towards younger ones. Younger ones experience this and have confidence that one day they can in turn be in that role, rather than all children waiting on adults to serve them. All kids learn that they are active, useful and integral parts of their community thru everyday interactions. When I went for the school tour a few years ago, I was really caught off guard by 4 children coming up to me to see if I wanted a drink. They were going to pour water for me and host me! It is a true testimony as to how TLH respects children as individuals, believes in their abilities, and empowers them, to the point that the children were not unduly afraid of me, and saw it as their responsibility to host me, the guest in their school. I had visited 10 schools before deciding on this one and even my 1st runner up school is a far cry from what happened during my tour here. The other schools basically told the children to not disturb the adult talking with the principal and go do their own thing. Whereas at TLH, while no one interrupted the conversation, the children were instead encouraged to step up. They are not treated like a distraction to the ‚Äúreal work‚Äù that only adults do, but they are empowered to play key roles in the ‚Äúreal work‚Äù. Imagine the feeling of accomplishment and personal value they feel, and how eager they would be to step up and take initiative again! It shows me how the teachers view the children and their abilities, and natural opportunities that can be seized to build the kids up. To me, these are very well trained and intelligent teachers, and I would be safe to partner with them for my child‚Äôs learning journey. There is an individualised learning plan for each child. Academic lessons like math and reading are done 1-1. The fast learner does not have to sit in a bored classroom learning what he already knows. The slower learner does not have to feel shame and be discouraged to try their best. The kids abilities are intimately known by teachers because of this 1-1 interaction. There is cooking every week where the children themselves get to cook! One of life's greatest sensorial experience. And they learn counting, fractions, mass and volume, chemical reactions, new vocabulary and all that academic stuff without even realizing it. Montessori schools are meant to be so much more than just Maria Montessori's materials. It is the entire ethos and community life, seeing thru children‚Äôs eyes and respecting them as valuable individuals. TLH is a Montessori par excellence.",0.18319175360158965,5,"['child', 'school', 'teacher', 'learn', 'montessori', 'kid', 'community', 'tlh', 'one', 'good', 'like', 'young', 'mean', 'ability', 'confidence', 'see', 'adult', 'cook', 'work', 'run']",The Little House (Montessori)

The teachers also took initiative and let us know that our daughter had shown signs that she was ready for toilet training. It is fascinating and reassuring that the teachers are attentive to the kids, dare I say more so than the parents given that we are 2 working parents... I found overall the children of The Little House to be confident, well-mannered, gentle and creative. The Montessori approach was instilled not just through the tools, facility, or the program - it lives in their daily interaction with the kids.

"The Little House Montessori is the best environment we could possibly have found for our daughters. Our eldest joined when we arrived in Singapore and took all of 20 minutes to settle in. The environment, the teachers and the other students all form a virtuous circle in which our daughter has become responsible, curious, caring of others and brave in voicing her opinion and exploring new things.

"When we moved to Singapore three years ago, we visited about 15 preschools before we chose the Little House Montessori for our eldest child. We are absolutely thrilled with our choice, and this year, our younger child also started at TLHM. Each child has an individualised education plan, and the teachers are very tuned in to the needs and progress of every child. With their decades of combined experience, they provide a lot of support and advice around any developmental and behavioural issues that your child may face. Our children love the geography lessons, the science experiments, the weekly cooking, the play-based learning, and the structure they get at school. As parents, we love the wholesome (bilingual) environment, the wonderfully diverse student group, the excellent team of teachers and staff, and the inclusive community, all ably held together and led by the head directress, Mrs. Katherine. I especially appreciate the emphasis on good manners, the practical lessons in independence, the focus on the children‚Äôs physical development, and the language support given for non-native Mandarin speakers. This is an incredible place for children to spend their early formative years, and I highly recommend the Little House Montessori to anyone who wants to inculcate confidence and a love of learning in their child.",0.3602777777777778,0,"['child', 'love', 'year', 'support', 'lesson', 'montessori', 'little', 'house', 'teacher', 'cooking', 'recommend', 'weekly', 'advice', 'need', 'ably', 'team', 'choose', 'development', 'developmental', 'progress']",The Little House (Montessori)
"Our first Son started with the Little House at the age of 18 months. After visiting more than 15 schools, it didn't take much thinking to decide on this one. The teachers are hands-on with all the kids and the older children in the school are all well mannered and courteous (a sign they must be doing things quite well). In proper Montessori style, they teach independence, value of community, behavior and life skills (the cooking every Thursday is the highlight for us). They keep the parents updated through regular newsletters, videos, photos about what the kids are learning during the day.

"If you're looking for a Montessori that has the best of everything - the classical Montessori environment and practices, a strong focus on the three Rs, a fun and energetic vibe, and more - The Little House Montessori is IT. What I loved the most was that they place a lot of importance on inculcating social graces and thoughtfulness in the children - saying please and thank you, forming and expressing their opinions politely yet effectively, taking turns, being fair, and so on. Children learn so much more than regular classroom stuff - cleaning their own plates and bowls after lunch, using various tools safely (such as scissors, punch machines, staplers, even the binding machine), cooking (and they share all the recipes with us at the end of the year!). The best part is how confident it makes the kids - all Little House kids I've met have this ""can-do"" attitude about everything. Every week, they conduct Science experiments (and they deal with serious stuff: density, buoyancy, condensation...) and teach Geography (they tell the kids about a new country and what's really special about it). Special mention must be made about Mandarin. My daughter joined TLH mid-year in N2, when we had just moved to Singapore. I was quite apprehensive about her having to deal with learning a new language along with everything else that was so new for her. Imagine my surprise (and relief!) when she soon started crooning in Mandarin! When I ask her who her favourite teacher is, most often she names Mandarin teacher that she names. Just to give an idea of how dedicated they are, during the first phase of the circuit breaker, the Mandarin teacher made detailed videos of writing and pronouncing each of the Chinese characters the kids needed to practise, which were so easy even for someone like me, with no knowledge of the language, to follow. And the teachers are truly so, SO caring. I have personally witnessed how lovingly they handle very young kids who are anxious about leaving their mums to go off alone to school. There have been kids who have screamed and cried for the better part of a term or more, but the teachers would handle the situation with seemingly effortless calm. They're also an inclusive school; there have been kids with special needs, who join in the fun with everyone else, including the year-end concert. I could go on and on. Long story short, though; if you're looking for a great school, Montessori or otherwise, for your 1.5 - 6 year old, you really must pay The Little House Montessori a visit.",0.2878563194052325,0,"['kid', 'teacher', 'montessori', 'mandarin', 'year', 'special', 'little', 'new', 'house', 'school', 'machine', 'language', 'handle', 'need', 'join', 'learn', 'good', 'look', 'fun', 'stuff']",The Little House (Montessori)
"To the best of my observations, I notice some positive changes on my children, throughout their pre school development. 1. Bahavioral development. My children display satisfactory self-discipline and esteem. Meanwhile, willing to care for others. 2. Emotion management. They are able to express their emotion in a good way. They express and they control it. 3. Self-initiative. They are becoming independent in a way they learn to manage things themselves. Learnt to reduce redundancy and becoming much reliable.

The Montessori curriculum was wonderful in developing his self-help skills as well as teaching kindness and consideration for others. The mixed age environment also meant that my son was able to be buddied by older pupils and interact with younger children, which was helpful for his social development.

"This was the first kindergarten I viewed after we moved to sunset area. I stepped in an old fashion glass door and got a warm welcome from Mrs Katherine. She enthusiastically walked me around while introducing how the classes would be carried out etc. We walked to the outdoor area, kids were happily playing in the small garden. There came a little girl, she saw me and came close to me. Before I realised, she poured me a glass of water from their snack station, where I saw a tray with couple of glasses stacking up, a jar of water and bananas neatly laying on top of it. That was it. I cancelled all appointments with other kindergarten and enrolled my boy. My boy was then 4yr8month, he enjoyed going to TLH so much. Every week he told me a new science experiment; a new country with either its language or food; a new role-play with manner; oh yeah, a new goodie he made under the instruction of teachers. I was very impressed. The teachers made it all seemed so effortless, yet meaningful. I remembered those days, parents gathered outside of the glass door where the kids lined up and got checked before going in school. Teachers welcomed kids with the brightest smile and funny talks. Mrs Katherine stood at her most comfy tree pose and chatted with us, we all started our days with lots of joy and laughter. Of course, most importantly, we knew our kids would have a wonderful school day at TLH. How can I not mention the year end concert? It was fascinating. Nothing fancy but full of love and warmth. Teachers and kids designed their own stage, no one needed to wear special clothes or make-up. Kids chose what they most comfortable with and what they want to perform. They gave it their best on the stage. It was a pure joy for parents to see the how much their confidence have grown over a year. 2020, the pandemic hit. Teachers in TLH managed to gather all students single performing clips and created a long video. It was heartfelt. Still it seemed so effortless but meaningful. We strongly recommend The Little House Montessori. It was the best decision to enrol our boy there. Everyday in his primary school life has benefitted greatly from his experience at TLH.

"I would like to extend my thanks to Mrs Katherine Sebastian of the Little House (Montessori) and her team of teachers for having done a good job of bringing up my two little ones, Zhi Rong and Jia Ning. I first chose this school, because, during the student visit, I was struck by the fact that the children were going about their studies, calmly and in an orderly manner, without any teacher screaming or raising their voice. Both kids attended 4 years of kindy and nursery education. I am happy with the academic standards of The Little House (Montessori) as they prepare the child for up to primary 2 level of studies Zhi Rong has been doing well in Primary one and two, in Pei Hwa Presbyterian. I am very appreciative of the close supervision and extra care the teachers took to look after my younger daughter. She was initially difficult and reluctant to learn. However, the teachers took the time to suss her out and managed to patiently coax her to apply herself, resulting in her catching up by the time she graduated from K2. We are confident she will not find primary one a struggle Teachers do give feedback to parents on how their kids are doing, and work hand in hand with parents for the betterment of the children. I especially appreciate the occasional talks given by teachers and Mrs Katherine, on how the school teaches their mathematics and English Language. They even hold small get together talks on ‚ÄúHow to get your children to behave the TLH way‚Äù (You must attend this one!!) Teacher turnover is low in this school, which helps the children feel they are in a safe and stable environment. I understand the school even sponsors teachers for higher learning! If I had a third child, I would not hesitate to send him or her to this school. The teachers are dedicated, professional, knowledgeable. The principal is serious about educating the children and maintaining standards. More than once, I asked her about expanding her school but she won‚Äôt do it if it compromises the standards set. A big thank you to Mrs Katherine Sebastian and the team that make up The Little House (Montessori). You helped to bring up my two kids.

"The Little House was a home away from home to both my children (now aged 9 and 7, and in the Singapore school system). They spent their preschool years playing and learning in the wonderfully creative and nurturing environment of TLH, created by Katherine and her amazing staff of teachers. From rigorous Mandarin, Math and English, to cooking, dancing, plays, games, unbelievably fun school bus rides and more, TLH played a huge role in their development, instilling confidence, empathy and resilience that will hopefully last them for many years to come. As a University educator myself, I cannot speak more highly of the learning environment at TLH - it is indeed a model that I sometimes wish we had the chance to follow even in tertiary education! I am eternally grateful to TLH for playing such a big role in my children‚Äôs early lives, and cannot recommend it highly enough!",0.18897058823529417,4,"['play', 'tlh', 'environment', 'home', 'school', 'year', 'child', 'role', 'highly', 'mandarin', 'speak', 'instill', 'little', 'grateful', 'rigorous', 'unbelievably', 'life', 'hopefully', 'ride', 'house']",The Little House (Montessori)
"TLH review A truly special place with heart, soul and an extraordinary crew of teachers! I visited a number of pre-schools while searching for a school for my first born and stopped searching the moment I visited TLH. It‚Äôs amazing how organised the school is; everyone seems to know exactly where to go and what to do at any point in time. Mrs Katherine runs a tight (and extremely effective) ship at TLH - clearly a woman on a mission! Things I love about TLH: - I love how the children are treated with respect, allowed to be responsible for themselves and others from a young age. They are encouraged to be individuals with unique personalities, strengths and weaknesses. There is no rote learning in this school; every child gets to play, explore and learn at their own pace. They‚Äôre taught to be respectful of mother nature and to be kind and empathic towards the needy. - I love how my kids come home happy every day, with tales of how they‚Äôve enjoyed learning about different countries and cultures from geography class, working with magnets during science class, singing about planets and continents at circle time, baking and cooking on Thursdays and most of all, fun times with their friends at the sandpit during outdoor play. - The birthday celebrations I‚Äôve attended at TLH are some of the most meaningful celebrations I‚Äôve ever been to. Instead of focusing the celebration around singing the obligatory ‚Äúhappy birthday‚Äù song and cake cutting, the teachers takes time to talk about the birthday child, from the time the child is in his mother‚Äôs womb to his milestones and achievements over the years, and the number of times the child has orbited around the sun. - I love how the annual year-end concert is organised as an intimate affair which prioritises the child‚Äôs learning process over the end product. No sleek venues, costly costumes or over-rehearsed performers. Instead, every child get to contribute, from creating the backdrop and props to choosing the item they‚Äôd like to perform. My younger child has recently started attending TLH as well, shortly after his 2nd birthday. I‚Äôm pleased to see how quickly he has adapted to the new environment and how he has grown in confidence, social and physical awareness since starting school at TLH.",0.29732285258601054,5,"['child', 'tlh', 'time', 'school', 'love', 'birthday', 'celebration', 'instead', 'attend', 'play', 'mother', 'start', 'visit', 'learning', 'year', 'search', 'number', 'teacher', 'class', 'learn']",The Little House (Montessori)
"Our daughter has attended two other pre-schools prior to The Little House, so we can confidently say that this place is truly special. It is a tight-knit community of outstandingly committed teachers with very low turnover (a problem at many other pre-schools!) and a lovely multicultural mix of students. We also love the school's premises - an airy main room with open doors and windows to the garden and playground, as well as dedicated areas for various purposes. We did not choose this school specifically for the Montessori method, but after witnessing this unique and extremely effective approach to learning we are convinced that this is one of the best ways to build a strong foundation and guide young children into the world of reading, writing and understanding numbers. Every child receives one-to-one attention and is allowed to learn at his or her individual pace. At this school, learning is made fun which in our opinion is the best gift you could give to your child. As a result, we are extremely confident that our daughter will have no problems whatsoever with the transition to primary school. In fact, her reading, writing and maths skills are above average for her age. Another strength of the school is the Mandarin programme which is conducted by native Chinese teachers. We have been thoroughly impressed with the advanced level of our daughter's Mandarin which she picked up solely at this school. The reason why I am emphasizing all these is not because I am overly concerned with her academic performance (not at this young age anyway), but because I have heard some other parents being worried about whether a pre-school with such strong Montessori philosophy would be a good preparation for local primary school. The answer is absolutely yes! In fact, Singapore needs many more schools like Little House! The curricular activities are rounded off by attention to character development and conveying a strong sense of community and teamwork to the children. Then there are the many wonderful traditions at the school that we have come to cherish over the years - the birthday walk, show & tell, Thursday's cooking class, the yearly Deepavali field trip to Little India (amongst many other regular field trips) and many more. We are fortunate to have discovered Little House, a true gem in the Sunset Way neighbourhood, and are already looking forward to enroll our second child in the 2017 intake.",0.2726052689594356,4,"['school', 'child', 'little', 'strong', 'learn', 'house', 'good', 'pre', 'daughter', 'way', 'mandarin', 'trip', 'community', 'attention', 'montessori', 'young', 'fact', 'extremely', 'age', 'writing']",The Little House (Montessori)
"We wish we had found this place sooner! We moved our son to TLH in June 2016 during his K1 year after his previous school shut down and it has been an amazing journey for him and for us as parents since he started here. Despite his difficulty with adapting to change, our son transitioned to TLH with remarkable ease, owed largely due to the creative teaching methods TLH uses. Their teachers put in a lot of effort into tailoring the curriculum to each child's individual learning capability. In under a year, our mostly English and partly Hindi speaking son was conversing fluently enough in Mandarin to defend himself if accused of a misdemeanor! The day is a good mix of dual language teaching and playtime, and the weekly sash races and cooking sessions were quite a highlight for our son. One of the things that makes TLH unique is their headmistress Katherine. Kind, funny and incredibly good at running this school, she has a wonderful way with the children and brings together children, teachers and parents alike to develop a wonderful community atmosphere.

"All my three children went to The Little House (Montessori), and we all love and miss it so much! Years after entering primary school, my children‚Äôs best friends are from TLH, and several of the families have become family friends. TLH is a true-blue Montessori school that focuses on all aspects of a child‚Äôs development: physical, intellectual, language, emotional and social. Each of my children received the attention they needed in the areas where they needed it. Eg. Child no. 1 had to learn to deal better with setbacks, and not lose her temper. Child no.2 needed speech therapy because she was not correcting her mispronunciations even with extra help. Child no. 3 had to learn to share with peers and take turns graciously. Chinese is an organic part of TLH. My children came home talking about a dessert they had sampled from ""Â¢®Ë•øÂì•"" (Mexico), talking about a science experiment that È©¨ËÄÅÂ∏à had shown them as well as an obstacle course where they had to Áà¨ËøáÊ°• (climb over the bridge). Learning to read was so effortless I did not hear about it, until they started pointing out random words they could recognise on billboards or tv subtitles: ‚ÄúMummy, that is ‚ÄúÊù•‚Äù, that is ""Êàë""!"" All three of my children were able to transition easily into primary school. Academically, they were at or above the standard required for primary one. But more importantly, each child took responsibility for their own learning, and took pride in their work. Even when tired and frustrated, each child took pains to finish their work to the best of their ability. Child no. 1 cried as she struggled to finish her math homework, but she stuck it out, working out each answer without guessing. Child no. 3 whined when he to re-write several words in the dreaded Stellar handwriting workbook, but a simple, ""what would your current teacher/Ms Katherine/Kristine/Mrs Jo say?"", were enough to spur him on. Child no. 2 continues to finish her homework independently, something she had done since P1. Socially and emotionally, each child was able to make the leap from a warm, cosy and loving preschool to the much larger and anonymizing primary school. They were confident in managing all the different tasks: making new friends, choosing and buying food from the canteen, being part of a large class of 30 silently copying information from the white board. My oldest is now in secondary school, and continues to blossom, I‚Äôm sure in part due to the 3.5 formative years she spent in TLH where she learnt positive habits of independence/self-help, care for others, responsibility and self-discipline. She is able to whip up a delicious meal for the entire family plus guests, due to the love of cooking she developed in TLH. (The weekly Thursday cooking lessons at TLH are legendary! Parents of multiple children look forward to certain dishes, in particular, the chocolate truffle!) TLH feels like a family. There is very low staff turnover. Many of the teachers taught all three of my children, and my children always look forward to going back for visits. Mrs Katherine Sebastian has created a preschool that combines fun with responsibility, love with discipline, bound together with a lot of warmth and friendship.",0.2067390942390942,5,"['child', 'tlh', 'school', 'family', 'primary', 'love', 'learn', 'finish', 'take', 'need', 'work', 'friend', 'able', 'responsibility', 'talk', 'forward', 'word', 'look', 'mrs', 'katherine']",The Little House (Montessori)
"My Daughter started at TLH when she was 2.5 years old. It was only by pure luck that I found the school (like most foreigners, I left the school application to the very last minute) and managed to secure the last slot. I feel very blessed that my Daughter had many happy years at TLH. At that time she was going through potty training and unlike most children, she was not embarrassed or uncomfortable with having ""accidents"" at school all the time. The Teachers were so fantastic in helping me with her pottty training and not once did they complain or grumble. I don't know any school that could be more caring and patient with my child. The children at TLH are guided to be independent and taught how to use a scissors correctly at a young age. And under supervision, they are taught cooking and the safe way to use a small knife or peeler. My Daughter is now 5 and she constantly helps out with the dinner preparation at home. Thanks to TLH she knows how to use these sharp objects safely and correctly. Each child progresses at their own pace so their is no pressure to keep up with someone else. They are taught such a wide range of subjects such as language, reading, Maths, science, cooking and geography. And all this is done in a fun and relaxed way that is easy for a child to understand. I cannot count the number of times I am pleasantly surprised when my Daughter comes home with knowledge such as being able to name all the continents or telling me all about Pluto, the dwarf planet! My Daughter learnt more Chinese at TLH than she did at an external enrichment centre. And later on when I engaged a private Chinese tutor for her, it was TLH that helped me find her. I find that the Teachers are always accessible and ready to help with any issues that I have. They have a good library of resources that enable me to guide my child at home with her studies. Even when I have questions about non-school related issues such as Behavioural problems, they are always willing to listen and guide me. My Daughter has unfortunately moved on to a good international school a couple of months ago. I didn't have a choice as she was offered a place and both my Husband and I are not locals. Because of the high standards at TLH, her writing, reading and Maths level surpassed that of other children in her class. In fact, she often has to help her classmates with their writing. I'm not sure if it's pure chance or if TLH is selective but I have not met a parent at TLH that I do not like. All the parents are very friendly and supportive, and I have made some very dear friends during my daughters time there. Most importantly, TLH has molded my Daughter into a wonderful person. Through TLH, she has learnt to say please and thank you. She learnt to say excuse me and wait her turn to speak. She learnt that smoking is bad. She learnt to be polite and gracious. These are only a fe of the examples amongst many more. I can spot a TLH child at a party. All the TLH children are polite and wait for their turn to have a slice of cake. TLH children do not poke the birthday party or demand their share. In fact, because she is taught to do so at TLH, my Daughter always serves everyone before she has her slice of cake. To summarise, TLH, as locals would say, ""spoil market only"". TLH is so great that no other school compares to it, not even close. Note: TLH has a fantastic catered lunch too, with healthy yet delicious options and the Teachers were very kind to help me keep track of how much my child ate.",0.22574149659863943,2,"['tlh', 'child', 'daughter', 'school', 'help', 'learn', 'teach', 'time', 'teachers', 'home', 'find', 'use', 'guide', 'correctly', 'training', 'thank', 'way', 'turn', 'local', 'writing']",The Little House (Montessori)

"We sent our daughter here for four years and we would unhesitatingly recommend it to any parent looking for a superb, well-balanced environment for their children. The staff are truly well-trained, and genuinely warm and caring. With the Montessori method, the children are given individual attention and learn at their own pace in a fun environment. The method ensures that each concept is firmly grasped before the child moves onto the next topic -- nothing is forced onto the child before he/she is ready. I was impressed with the high standards of Mandarin taught and as far as math, reading and writing are concerned, I have no doubt my child will breeze through most of Primary 1. The children are not coddled; they're encouraged to be curious, to figure things out themselves, and to ask if they have questions. Children are introduced to different countries and cultures. They learn to cook little dishes. They build confidence with their weekly show-and-tells, and the open mic at the year-end concerts. If there are playground arguments, they are taught to express their feelings and resolve issues politely. They do science experiments; I was very pleasantly surprised to have my six-year old talk to me about condensation and evaporation. They're encouraged to go out and play and climb and they're taught it's fine to fall down and get a little sweaty and dirty. We loved the multiculturalism in the school; on one occasion, when the kids were taught how to react when they are unable to catch what someone has said, they role-played the situation in English and Mandarin, and one of the kids covered it in French, which I thought was awesome. The high teacher-to-student ratio ensured that teachers were able to give each child individual attention and form close, nurturing relationships. We also liked their involvement with charities. It gave the kids an opportunity to learn that it is a privilege to be able to help the less fortunate, and gave the parents an opportunity to support those in need. The school will provide a firm foundation for further education but what we think makes it stand out, and what we are most grateful for, is the time spent teaching the children self-confidence, self-control, respect for others and social etiquette. For example, one of the (many) lessons was about how to interrupt a conversation politely, another involved teaching the children how holding the door open is a polite and thoughtful act. The school considers social skills an important part of a child's development, and I have noticed that kids from The Little House Montessori are generally polite, kind, respectful and well-adjusted, while still maintaining their own individual, independent personalities. We cannot thank Katherine and the other teachers at The Little House Montessori enough for what they have done for our child.",0.1729142300194932,4,"['child', 'teach', 'little', 'kid', 'individual', 'school', 'year', 'give', 'montessori', 'learn', 'teacher', 'house', 'able', 'ensure', 'environment', 'social', 'encourage', 'self', 'method', 'play']",The Little House (Montessori)

"Both my children have been at The Little House since they were 2.5 years old and it has been the best decision I have ever made as a parent. Ten Things I love about The Little House (Montessori) 1. My kids are ALWAYS excited to go to school, and they are always happy when they come home. 2. My kids have rarely been sick since they started. Compared to being in day-care centres before, I can count on one hand the number of sick days my kids have taken. The space is airy and the children have an outdoors play area. They are allowed to be kids and get dirty, play in grass, in sand, bounce on the trampoline, ride bicycles, play pretend, climb on monkey bars. They don't spend all their time washing hands like in day-care-centres, but are taught proper common sense hygiene. 3. TLH is like an extension of our home. There is a VERY low turnover rate with teachers and so the children feel very safe and secure at school. 4. It is always calm. With 50 -60 kids doing different activities at different times, you would often imagine chaos. But in all the times that I have been at the school, peeked through the glass doors, the school environment has always been very calm and the children are often busying themselves with something. 5. Katherine - the principal of the school leads by example and is personally involved in every child's development. She is the heart of the school and the children and teachers make up the soul. 6. TLH has a wonderful network of parents and alumni. Ex-students are often seen at the school functions and end-of-year concerts. School events are so much fun. 7. Best end-of-year concerts. The first part of the concert is like an open mic event, where kids get to choose with whom they perform with, and what they do. The teachers then help them arrange that. The second part will usually be a play where all props and backdrops are made by the older kids. The last part is always a song where the kids all sing together. This is usually when I start tearing up. The concert is held within the school and lunch is served after. Parents are invited to potluck, so it is really like a huge party for the kids and parents. 8. Cooking is a life skill taught to the children once a week. I run a business teaching people to cook, so this is something that I think is dear to my heart. Younger kids get help in the kitchen, with cutting/slicing. As they get older, they are able to manage the prep more independently. My girls are always excited and proud of themselves when they bring their cooked food home. Even if the food isn't always quite edible, it is a great exercise to get the kids used to. We all have to start somewhere and it is really okay if your biscuits turned out like rocks, or if your sweet and sour dish is more sweet than sour - it's all part of the learning process. All recipes are put on a calendar that the school produces every end of the year. This calendar is customised to have your child's face on the front cover, so it is a great keepsake and gift to grandparents who live overseas. 9. Flexibility. The school is very flexible to accommodating children/parents request. As the school owns the school bus, they are able to be flexible with pick up and drop off requests. Whenever possible, they always try to help parents with playdate drop offs. 10. Method. I think the method that is implemented at the school is extremely well thought through and works. The school is always on top of what each child is doing, and their overall development and progress. Parent Teacher Conferences are held twice a year. If we have any questions, Katherine's door is ALWAYS open for a chat or update. My oldest daughter graduated from The Little House last year and is now in Primary 1. She was able to transition easily because of the self-discipline and independence instilled into her at TLH when it comes to learning. She understands that they is time for work, and time for play. I really recommend TLH as a preschool to be your child's home away from home.",0.1996399824134199,4,"['school', 'kid', 'child', 'parent', 'year', 'like', 'play', 'time', 'home', 'tlh', 'concert', 'old', 'teacher', 'little', 'house', 'able', 'day', 'think', 'start', 'help']",The Little House (Montessori)
"Sent both my kids here. It's a great school that embraces diversity. It's important that our children interact with peers with different needs. Besides preparing the children academically for primary school, TLH also creates space for children to grow in confidence. They teach soft skills explicitly e.g. role-playing appropriate behavior for different settings, and get children to practise them too e.g. washing of plates, looking after the younger children esp on fieldtrips. Both my kids grew in confidence in TLH and enjoys things like real cooking, weekly show and tell, climbing outdoors. This is a true Montessori school. It's also great that the school brings in extra curricular activities like aikido and music so we don't need to send the children for enrichment ourselves.",0.2958333333333334,4,"['child', 'school', 'grow', 'need', 'great', 'kid', 'tlh', 'send', 'like', 'confidence', 'different', 'tell', 'fieldtrip', 'important', 'weekly', 'curricular', 'prepare', 'interact', 'peer', 'enrichment']",The Little House (Montessori)

"Dear TLH, When we first started@TLH, we only had a three-year old and being returning singaporeans, we heard about TLH through a friend who homeschools her kids (she heard wonderful stories about TLH from a friend).  When Qi first started, you had asked me this, ""Did you notice that when she runs, she tip-toes? "" Your montessori-trained teachers observe keenly!¬† i was embarrassed that as a mother,¬† i have no clue that she does that! Having 4 kids allow us the opportunity to experience TLH longer. Our family enjoy especially the annual year-end concert.¬† It is, in my opinion, a concert like no other school concert - the children come first rather than the performance (yet we were thoroughly entertained and every year,¬† TLH took the effort to make a different backdrop :)!¬† ). There are no grand hotels and thousand-dollar tickets, only a community that chipped in to bring what they have to share. It is good that the preparation for the concert lasted for only a couple of weeks; children are not performers and ThankU for keeping them that way. The teachers you hire are of exceptional calibre: their linguistic capability is a quality that we may not get in every community. Little children's absorbent minds hear the language spoken properly and in turn, they articulate the language correctly too. ThankU for being firm to the little ones in a gentle, loving manner; there is no shouting, only reminding them the right way of doing things. This is where I wonder if it's the methodology or the school setting - perhaps TLH can share with interested parents how this can be done at home!

"My second daughter, who is 5 years old, and my eldest son, who is 2 years old, attend this school. They have been attending the school for over 2 years and for over 5 months, respectively.

I don't have to worry about English because I am learning phonics. We also have Chinese lessons. When a friend asks me about kindergartens in Singapore, I have no hesitation in recommending The Little House, and the biggest reason for that is the sense of security. You can see everywhere that the principal, who is full of kindness and passion, and the teachers with a wealth of experience are paying close attention to each child. This includes the school bus to and from kindergarten. In addition, the individual activity PDFs (with photos) sent regularly are very useful for understanding the atmosphere at the kindergarten and as an opportunity to talk with the children about daily life at the kindergarten. I would like to keep it digitally.

My eldest daughter attended the school for about 2 and a half years, and my youngest son went there for about 8 months. During that time, there were times when I was worried about my child, but having a reassuring teacher made me feel at ease. For the past year and a half, events have been restricted due to the coronavirus, but the events held at schools before the coronavirus were also very wonderful.

As a result, my daughter has grown rapidly and continues to make remarkable progress in her areas of expertise. Maybe that's a good thing because you'll be placed in a vertically divided environment regardless of your grade level.

"""Enrolled my 9 months old boy since 2020 with Jenna as the school principal. Infant care to playgroup experience was fine until we noticed he often came home with big mosquito bites mainly due to the school allowing the children to eat outdoors which have higher exposure to mosquitoes. Poor hygiene issues mainly also arise from the fact that they don‚Äôt shower the children after outdoor play. They only change clothes after play and the children sleeps sweaty. All the above issues caused ill health to my toddler. We withdrew our boy due to an incident of negligence whereby our boy was allowed to wear socks in the music room and he bumped his head with big bruises on the forehead. Our heart broke, and when we went to pick him up from Superland Outram, it was highlighted to us he have many ulcers at the back of his mouth again. This was the 3rd time our boy caught HFMD from Superland Outram. The doctor we visited suggested us changing the preschool after hearing our story.

"Superland Outrum is a great school with loving teachers and principal. My son was in the school since 4 month old and was well taken care by his infant class teachers. I could go to work without worry. He then move on to PG and adapted well to the new class. His PG teachers are very loving, patient and fun. He blossom into an independent toddler and full of curiousity. He started singing and talking alot which I knew he leant from his teachers. He loves his teachers and friends. I especially loves the outdoor element in the school where my son gets lots of sunshine and play. Overall the school is good in their communication with parents and great teachers. We have to withdraw my son to join his elder sister in another school for more easier logistics.

"Just want to share my experience and raise awareness to whoever considering to send their children to this school. I enrolled my Daughter to this school 2 years ago and within this time span, I moved her to a total of 4 different outlets hoping that they may be better but I was so wrong. To think that sending your children to a private preschool may bring you more value, learning and development for your child, think again for this school as my child was mostly playing all the time and could not even get her basics right. It gets worse. The Montessori is just a gimmick to earn more money for the school. I am not sure if the teachers are even properly trained as I feel they are very unprofessional and clueless, wonder how are they even qualified to be Teachers in the first place? I had even witnessed an incident where officers came down for certain checks, and a few classes were brought elsewhere out of the office to ‚Äúhide‚Äù. Believe they could be unlicensed or had no carts. This was my last straw, to have a school doing such acts and shortchanging my child. Isabelle and Danielle (owner and principal of the school) had always tried comforting me by saying that my child was in good hands, my foot. Just trying to make easy money is what both of them are good at. They are salespeople, the kinds you meet when engaging an ID or buying a secondhand car. All promises are made beforehand, and until you have made your purchase, that‚Äôs when your worst nightmare comes. Conclusion, if you want to bring your children here, think twice. For the fees you are paying, I believe there are better schools out there. Even government schools are better in my opinion. Anyone has the same thoughts, feel the strong need to share this to everyone.",0.13831417624521072,5,"['school', 'child', 'bring', 'well', 'think', 'try', 'teacher', 'time', 'believe', 'send', 'bad', 'feel', 'share', 'money', 'good', 'want', 'come', 'place', 'act', 'car']",Superland Pre-School (Outram)
"Superland was the local neighborhood school, we used to love. We started our baby girl in Outram location and since moved to the Tiong Bahru Community Club location. Our baby girl is now K1 and we have seen the expansion of this once admirable school. The pursuit of profit takes a toll on teachers. Safety standards have been dropped. Our girl came back with a big bruise because the playground was not properly padded. They covered the cement with fake grass, that is it, no padding. This location is super secretive. They do not allow parents to enter and poke around. They don't even have a doorbell. Education standards have also been dropped. Chinese curriculum is low. My girl tells me that she does drawings during Chinese lesson. The English teacher is part time and is balancing her schedule between two schools. We thought that the owner and principal care about the children. Now, I'm not so sure. She is likely to kick our kids out of the school for writing this. She thinks parent is the problem, whenever there is a dispute. However, I felt that parents have the right to know and participate in their child's education.

"My husband and I enrolled our child on the spot after visiting the school - it was exactly what we were looking for - great curriculum with a perfect balance of academics, fun, art and music etc., a clean and neat environment full of natural lighting, and a welcoming team of teachers and principal. This school is very different from all the other 4 we had visited. Joey had been very helpful with the enrolment process and it's the small things she does that we appreciated (she has superb memory when it comes to remembering adults and kids she meet, even if it's a brief encounter), and was very responsive to every question we had throughout - thank you! Teachers are super patient and we can see that our child has smoothly transitioned into this school after a couple of weeks, and most of all, he enjoys himself a lot.

She has been very engaging, patient, professional and transparent over all the processes and activities at Superland (BT). We are sincerely thankful for that and glad that our child has such a delightful place to learn and grow. It is without a doubt, this is the happiest and most fun preschool environment for a child. The school focuses on positive learning, time management, grace, common courtesy and social skills. Its a definitely a wonderful balance. The teachers and staff really love their work and all of the children are incredibly engaged in the classroom (Thank you for the beautiful pictures).

"BEST DECISION EVER to enroll our kids into Superland Bukit Timah! The team of teachers are superb, communicative and professional. Regardless of the massive number of competing schools in this area, Superland stands out as the best in terms of a holistic curriculum and price point (Deep Value). The school is super clean, neat and bright which provides our kids with a good environment for their growth and education. Our son was fairly young (18 months) and we were very uncertain about getting him used to the idea of pre school. Thankfully the team at Superland were very attentive to him and was able to settle him down fairly quickly. We get regular updates through an app and are happy to learn about how he is doing for the day, week and month. For parents who are afraid of HFMD or Covid clusters etc., FEAR NOT! Breakouts are contained fairly quickly as the kid is quickly isolated away in a safe area while the parents are informed within minutes to take their child home. Cluster updates are also given daily to ensure parents that the kids in school are safe.

"We moved to this area and for convenience, picked the school nearest to us with an available slot for our then 18 month-old. This was a brave move for me (I'm a teacher myself) as I usually do a ton of research on anything. But when we saw the space and met Joey and Teacher Puteri, we decided that this was the school for us. Now, 6 months on, we're still loving the school. The space is really, really beautiful. The warm tones sit well with me because it doesn't overwhelm the children, but that's just aesthetic, right? The ones who really make a true difference are the teachers. Every morning, we are greeted with Joey's amazing enthusiasm and my daughter went from crying at the door to walking in confidently, in just a matter of weeks. We are kept in constant update on what's going on in school and we can be sure that Joey is ever-present in her communication with us. Just this morning, there was a crazy thunderstorm and when the teacher saw us parking, she ran out with a giant umbrella so that we'd stay dry.

"My child has been attending Superland (BT) since she was 13 months old and so far the experience with the school has been a very pleasant and enjoyable one! My child learnt so much from the school - signing please and thank you, dancing and recognising to songs that were played in school. The school has made me discovered the sides of my child that I never knew, i.e. bravery! I look forward to all the many updates from school via the app. It warms my heart to see the way my child looks at her teachers (teacher Joey, teacher Liana, teacher Pat) - that is when I knew my child is very well taken care of :') So many good things to share about the school: - On admission, enquiries and school tour arrangements were handled very promptly. - Passionate teachers, helps to ease my child into school - The older kids at school are also all so welcoming and warm to the younger child - The school takes actions on feedback - School's environment is so pretty (bright, spacious and airy!) and good cleanliness - Strong sense of responsibility and accountability - The teachers around the drop off area are always cheery. - teachers always spare time to speak with the parents at pick up - The responses with the school is always VERY PROMPT, even on weekends!? Depending on the route you take, the downside could probably be that it requires a little walking if you were to get to the school by public transport. Also, the school is not a partner or anchor operator - so the school fees are expected to be higher than the schools who are!

"I should start the review by saying I never wanted to share this to selfishly keep the herds from coming in but that‚Äôs not fair so here goes! Our beloved preschool closed some months ago and in choosing a new place, I wanted to join a preschool that was communicative and focussed on play! It was also important to me that the principal was proactive and vested and thankfully, we had the pleasure of encountering Joey and her team at the new super land at Bukit Timah. Apart from the impressive premises that comprises an in house chef, multi language programs and a super cute library for the kids, what convinced me was the communication, effort and friendliness of Joey. She knew all the kids in the school, was quick to attend to any needs or questions, and went out of her way to make me and boy feel comfortable about the transition. Throughout the many school disruptions due to covid, Joey and team were proactive in getting home packs done and are always checking in to see how the kids are going. Now that my boy has been there for months, the Teachers have been patient in attending to his needs even the arduous process of potty training and Joey in particular has reached out to ensure everything including the birth of my second child was a smooth one for me and my boy!

"Our kids have been attending the Superland Pre-school 100AM from its opening in 2019 to the date of this review. It is a Montessori-inspired curriculum (not a full-on Montessori school) and our kids have thoroughly enjoyed the school and really liked their teachers. In addition to immersive Chinese class daily, they also offer Japanese and French classes - our kids really enjoyed both Chinese and Japanese classes!! I feel the curriculum is diverse and fun, lots of hands-on activities and very engaging for the kids while also preparing them well for classroom style education. The teachers have always been so thoughtful and creative, and put in lots of efforts to engage both kids and parents. Even during the last two challenging years of COVID-19, the teachers quickly picked up teaching online and tried their best to show parents kids' progress - nice, fun videos too! A few teachers have changed but usually only at the end of the school year. And as an ex-teacher myself, I know that means the school is a relatively enjoyable working environment so that the teachers were all very considerate when leaving the school; happy teachers = happy kids!! The administration team keeps the parents well informed. One of our favorite thing about the school is its space - it has lots of natural lighting and relatively high ceiling (both rarely found in the CBD area!). Even though has a bit of echo and aircon is quite cold, it feels spacious and has enough space to play. It also has an outdoor field upstairs but due to COVID-19, they have stopped going up -- hopefully it will restart soon!! Another thing that my kids have told me is that they enjoy their meals at school - a small but important thing to note! :) The administration team upkeeps the school very well and communicates with parents regularly - all parents also have direct communication with teachers via an app. We deeply appreciate the wonderful teachers and staff Teacher Abby, Teacher Clarie, Teacher Si, Wang Laoshi, Liu Laoshi, Kaori-sensei and Principal Wahila and Ms. Nisa for supporting our kids through their early education for the past few years!",0.24595601851851848,2,"['teacher', 'school', 'kid', 'parent', 'lot', 'enjoy', 'year', 'thing', 'class', 'team', 'relatively', 'chinese', 'space', 'curriculum', 'administration', 'happy', 'feel', 'montessori', 'laoshi', 'fun']",Superland Pre-School (100 AM) Pte Ltd

Surprisingly there are quite a few of her kindergarden ex class friends in VJC during that year. We are quite impress on the early childhood influence. Some things must have done right. My 2nd born Kendric graduated this year 2023 from K2.. overall this is a great neighbourhood school who the management spend great effort . Infant care is a new section so no comments as my son was not from this infant care. He joined in play group and progress along. Teachers overall are fine with some exception ones .. there are ups and down moments especially During covid period. We can see great effort from the principal.

"I have the most amazing experience to share. My son is diagnosed as 2e (twice exceptional) gifted child with autism + dyslexia. Since infancy, he has problems attending several prestigious childcare centres in town area. He is now in K2, 5 months to Primary 1. I have decided to look for a childcare with a good review of the principal. I told the Principal Ruth truthfully that I need help to integrate him for school readiness, and I am entrusting my son in her hands. TADAH!

"I would like to express my deep concerns regarding the quality of education and care at Sunshine Kids Care Centre. My child attended the school for a brief period, and I was extremely disappointed with the level of service provided. One of the most alarming issues I observed was the chronic shortage of teachers. Despite being a well-known neighbourhood preschool, they are continuously understaffed, which results in the children not receiving the appropriate attention they require. I noticed that the turnover rate of teachers was quite high, which further worsened the situation. The lack of continuity in the teaching staff made it difficult for my child to settle in and establish a stable learning routine. Furthermore, the children's turnover rate was also high, which was a cause for concern. The frequent comings and goings of students resulted in a disruptive and unsettling atmosphere for the children. The children require a stable environment to develop their social and learning skills, which the preschool failed to provide. I would advise parents to think twice before enrolling their children at Sunshine Kids Care Centre. The chronic shortage of teachers, high turnover rates, and disruptive atmosphere can have detrimental effects on children's development. I urge the school's management to address these issues promptly to ensure that the children receive the education and care they deserve.",-0.049111111111111105,1,"['child', 'care', 'rate', 'turnover', 'teacher', 'high', 'learning', 'result', 'issue', 'provide', 'centre', 'shortage', 'preschool', 'education', 'school', 'kids', 'concern', 'stable', 'require', 'receive']",Sunshine Kids Care Centre @ Punggol Pte Ltd

"My 1st born is one of the first few infant that joined the infant care at Punggol when they started the infant care service. She was 3 months plus when she joined and is 18 months now. Through out the 15 months there, we are happy with her development and thankful to Ms. Ruth (Principal) and the teachers there who showered her with care and love. Over the 15 months, there were some minor scratches sustained but nothing serious. And we were always informed of such scratches by Ms Ruth or the teachers. Occasionally, we would notice diaper rashes and would feedback to the teachers/Principal and the teachers there would take extra care to change the diaper more frequently throughout the day. All in all, I think being a neighbourhood childcare and infant care, they had done an excellent job in taking care of my daughter and contributed to her development. The centre also organizes events during festive period and invite the parents to participate which I think it's a good initiative to allow parents to have a glimpse of how the centre culture is like. We have already booked a place for our 1st born to join the Playgroup and also plan to register our soon to arrive 2nd baby for the infant care as well.",0.23333333333333334,0,"['care', 'infant', 'teacher', 'month', 'join', 'diaper', 'think', 'scratch', 'centre', 'development', 'principal', 'parent', 'ruth', 'bear', 'baby', 'allow', 'excellent', 'extra', 'culture', 'glimpse']",Sunshine Kids Care Centre @ Punggol Pte Ltd

"My review here is for the sunshine infant care centre. My baby has suffered for 3 months in this centre with a serious cut on the head which became a permenent scar. The school teachers did not inform me immediately. When my wife and i fetched our baby, we noticed the cut and the teacher lied that it was due to our baby to pull the helmet of other baby. We knew that there are CCTV cameras installed on the center and we asked principal for an explanation. After a long delay, the principal told us that it was likely due to a circular teaching tool which had sharp edges and that the babies were not well seated on chairs and the tool was passed around among the babies. In addition to the cut, we noticed that almost all babies cried when a china teacher carried them. Upon further enquiry with a former teacher, we found out that the teacher scolds the babies everyday and we also saw that she shook an infant violently when the infant cried. We had to change school to let our baby leave this horrible place.",-0.2294871794871795,1,"['baby', 'teacher', 'infant', 'cut', 'cry', 'notice', 'school', 'centre', 'tool', 'principal', 'let', 'immediately', 'china', 'teaching', 'helmet', 'violently', 'camera', 'center', 'likely', 'carry']",Sunshine Kids Care Centre @ Punggol Pte Ltd

"""To be honest, when we first toured the school we did not like it very much but still decided to give it a chance. Contrary to the tour we had with the prev sch where the teachers tried to engage, smiles and talk to my son, the teachers at Sunflower Preschool did not bother to engage or talk. (This was on a Saturday) The Principal does not seem to know what she was talking about and when asked questions, the answers she gives were uncertain. I think this is where we should have caught the signs and not enroll him. On the first day of school, one of the parents will be allowed to sit in for an hour to let the child adapt. I witness a few things in the school and was straightaway uncomfortable with putting my son in the care of the teachers there. The list are as follows: 1. One of the teacher wearing a mask kissed another infant (Honestly, i can understand if sometimes teachers very sayang the baby then they wanna hug them or cuddle and kiss them. However, there are a lot of germs on the mask.) 2. During shower, the teacher look frustrated when showering my son as he was no familiar with the place and kept crying. ( You can tell from the mannerism) 3. During milk feeding time, the teacher vigorously shakes the bottle while the bottle was in my son‚Äôs mouth to make him drink the milk. 4. The school strictly limits milk for my then 11 MONTH OLD son at 1PM & 4PM only. This is actually my dealbreaker. There is not flexibility whatsoever. I have called the principal to discuss this however she was firm and would not give any leeway. Her reason being - they are at the age where they have to train their motor skill (?) Something along the line. I have checked with other schools and there is no such policies or rules in their IFC. 5. I don‚Äôt believe the school was honest. In the school app, the school always input that my son finishes his milk. My son always have a problem w drinking his milk and there will alw be leftover. Even in the previous school, he hd an issue with milk intake and the teacher will feedback in the school app accordingly. 6. On his first day of school, HALF DAY. I trusted my son in their care and he came back w a bruise on his face. Usually i would be OK with this kind of injury as they are learning how to walk and are crawling around. But it is the first day of school and he was there for only 3 hours without my supervision. You would think that the teachers will pay more attention to the new infant attending a new school but it does not seem to be the case. I completely understand that accidents can happen but not when it is the first day of school and they are most definitely not short-handed if they are a ratio of 1:3. 7. The school is an air-conditioned facility. After showering they will put the baby in the play area where the FAN is blowing directly at them. 8. My son fall sick 3 times in the less than one month he was there. The first time was runny nose, second and third was back to back stomach flu. He had ongoing runny nose for few weeks. I had to take a lot of AL and CCL due to these. There was no notification from the school of related cases. I believe this is negligence from the school part. 9. The principal is really clueless. The school app does not allow teachers to communicate w the parents directly and only the principal has access to the school communication app. During the first day, when i asked the principal about the access for the school app, she merely said,‚Äù er, you should have access w the app cause same as prev school.‚Äù She obviously doesnt know what she was talking about. I checked w the admin afterwards. 10. We told the school that we would like to withdraw our son on the third day. However, we have to serve a month notice else our deposit will be forfeited. He cried everyday he attended school. It was heartbreaking. In view of the above reasons, if they dared behave like this infront of the parent. I wonder how they are like behind closed curtains. (The curtains are always closed) Please send you child to Sunflower Preschool @ Teck Ghee at your own risk.",0.04035494166850099,4,"['school', 'son', 'teacher', 'day', 'app', 'milk', 'principal', 'like', 'talk', 'parent', 'month', 'access', 'time', 'shower', 'baby', 'new', 'tour', 'allow', 'closed', 'engage']",Sunflower Preschool @ Teck Ghee Pte Ltd
"My 13months old child has been in this IFC since 3 months old. What I like about the center is the very low turnover rate. Since my child started school, the core team of full time teachers has not changed at all except for one who had to leave due to medical reason. This helps with establishing consistent routines for my child such as nap routines. And I think having low turnover helps in building relationship with my child, allowing her to feel safe and secure with the familiar adults. This is very evident every morning at drop offs when she is happy to go school, she baobao the teacher spontaneously. In terms of communication with parents, they used an app but it's to update on the day activities (without picture) of the child (e.g. nap start and end time, milk feed volume, diaper change time). Then every two weeks, the P would send a one page file, usually with two pictures, of what my child has done for the two weeks. In short, dont expect a lot of photo updates. I'm actually very happy with this arrangement because it means the teachers' phone usage time is very low. They can really focus on the children. Anyway they update me every time at pick up and drop off so I think that's good enough for me. Overall, the P and teachers are very assuring and always work collaboratively with us. Once in a while, the teachers will advise me to work on certain skills which I found really helpful. ‚Äî Add on: With regards to feeding, based on my little one‚Äôs experience in the school (but please check in with school), before they go on solids, the milk schedule is individualised. We have to key in the app the last feed we gave to our baby before sending to school so that they know what time to give the next feed. In fact there was once I forgot to key and teacher had to call me. Then when my little one is able to sit well on a chair (usually around 7months), they will be given oats at 10am (replace a milk feed) - you can either choose to eat the one given by school or you provide. Then when she was promoted to mobile side, usually around 10-11months when they can stand, the oats was replaced with porridge and there is also a tea break (most of the time are fruits) at about 3pm. After one year old, there‚Äôs also breakfast at 8am. I find the teachers really understanding because they tried replacing the 8am milk feed with the breakfast provided but my girl kept crying despite consuming a lot of the breakfast. They updated me at pick up on the same day and told me most likely she couldn‚Äôt adapt to the change (for breakfast only, she was ok with the rest of the solids at other timings that were introduced much earlier) and suggested to continue to give her a little milk in school and then they will give her a reduced portion of breakfast after that. We agreed, the teachers tried and it worked! So I would say there is flexibility when there is a need to!",0.13846493675595242,3,"['teacher', 'school', 'time', 'child', 'milk', 'breakfast', 'feed', 'update', 'old', 'replace', 'give', 'low', 'work', 'usually', 'little', 'change', 'send', 'lot', 'week', 'try']",Sunflower Preschool @ Teck Ghee Pte Ltd
"had to say something after seeing a 1-star review of the IFC, which our daughter is in since when she was only 2+months. She has been with the IFC for 10+ months now. Overall, we are very pleased to have found this rare gem at such a price point. WHY? 1. the IFC has its own dedicated space and does not cluster-congregate with PG, N1 & N2. There was a sofa within for teachers to 'rest' and feed the babies. 2. the teachers, mostly mandarin speaking, really care of the babies. will there be accidents? yes, my daughter hit her head a couple of times, but hey, try taking care of 3 babies concurrently. what I appreciate is that the teachers were transparent and share during dismissal without sweeping under the carpet. 3. the principal often pops over and will personally cover any shortfall in manpower / MC. Have seen her doing so a few times. because afterall, everyone knows taking care of babies are not easy because they are more vulnerable. 4. There is regular teacher-parents meet with parents. This tickled us previously because honestly, what is there to update for babies? and also, they already updated us weekly and also biweekly over the app. The principal works on Sunday and send parents the biweekly update on Sunday. if this isn't dedication, I don't know what is. 5. when our baby girl had eczema, the IFC teachers were very willing to help with the cream application because they were truly concerned. They also spent the effort to 'troubleshoot' with us initially on what might be the cause, changing bath lotion and body cream. 6. when my baby was transiting to solids, I was very worried because she had a couple of episodes vomiting in her sleep midnight. The Principal and IFC teachers worked hand-in-glove with us to help tide through this phase, sharing in full details of their meals / ingredients and even calling me personally to address my worries. Did I ever think of pulling my baby out and changing centres? Being a first time parent, yes, I did. Because she kept falling sick every 2 ~ 3 weeks initially. but after reading some parents' forum, I realised it is the rite of passage for all babies/children, even for IFCs which charge $2+K per month. Further, babies do develop awareness over time. It is traumatic for babies to change schools and change carers. Hence, I dropped the idea completely. Glad I did. and yes, I do recommend this IFC as long as it is the same Principal and the same IFC teachers. :)",0.11378648233486943,3,"['baby', 'ifc', 'teacher', 'parent', 'principal', 'time', 'change', 'care', 'update', 'yes', 'know', 'month', 'take', 'daughter', 'personally', 'share', 'help', 'see', 'initially', 'couple']",Sunflower Preschool @ Teck Ghee Pte Ltd
"Had to share my experience after seeing the 1 star review & feels that somehow things doesn't add up here. Sent my first child there since he was 4 months old & 2nd child also managed to enroll in the school, both receive lots of love & affection from all teachers. Communication has always been a breeze with the school teachers & principle, in the initial phase when the app wasn't available yet & also now, with the usage of the app. They will usually give an informal short update when we pick the kids up as well. The team has always been very transparent with the kids activities, be it good or bad. This gives us the confidence that they are actually bother about the wellbeing & growth of our kids. Feed scheduling: I left this to the experts as they are trying to establish a feed routine for the kids & in the long term it will make life easier for everyone, parents included, since the kids will want to feed at a fixed timing, making it easier to plan around them. Injuries: refer to top.. Very transparent about all incidents thus far. They will call us if it is too serious but hey whats growing up without a few bumps & bruises? With regards to the kids falling sick while in school, it is a known fact that this will happen no matter which pre-school they are sent to. Probably the only way to skip this is to bubble wrap them in a clean room environment, i guess. No issue with the communication over the app or what so ever. They have a hotline & whatsapp number for emergency contact, in case you need them for whatever reasons. Curtians....

We liked that it was a good size school, not too big, not too small, with kids from different background and nationalities. Ms Angela and her caring team made us feel reassured and confident about the school before joining and since Day 1 after we did. We‚Äôve never looked back and love how the team had always been so loving with our children. Being foreigners, we had no family support and having our kids at Sunflower enabled us to juggle between work and the family with the peace of the mind. The school feels like a little family thanks to its great caring team and the parents we became friends with. The teachers always took the time to engage and discuss with us, whenever we had any question or concern, they would always address them. Aside from that, what stood out is the Chinese level. It is very impressive compared to other schools that claim to be ‚Äúbilingual‚Äù. Our kids loved learning Chinese thanks to the laoshi they had who have been at Sunflower for decades. All in all, for families looking for a nurturing environment for their child(ren), please consider Sunflower baby house on your list and have a look! A Big Thanks to Angela and the Sunflower Baby House team for always going the extra mile and building beautiful memories for and with our 2 kids ‚ô•Ô∏è",0.2635,2,"['sunflower', 'team', 'kid', 'family', 'school', 'baby', 'thank', 'look', 'house', 'feel', 'big', 'like', 'care', 'love', 'infant', 'caring', 'angela', 'child', 'chinese', 'take']",Sunflower Baby House & Preschool
"We chose Sunflower for our older boy (now P3) when he was 9 months old primarily because there used to be a branch less than 5 minutes' drive from our place. When that branch had to close we were too lazy to find a new childcare centre so we moved to the (original) Grandstand branch. Our younger one followed when he was 3.5 months. We don't have a helper and my husband and I both work FT, so finding an infantcare centre we could trust was important. I didn't feel the need in the past 8 years to be overly concerned about how they were doing in infantcare, then PG, nursery and kindergarten; they were always happy, thriving, and well taken care of physically and emotionally by the teachers. They enjoyed a range of enrichment activities provided by the centre, and - this is important - were adequately prepared through Sunflower's Chinese programme for SAP school life. Notwithstanding there being no Âê¨ÂÜô (that I knew of anyway, lol). We didn't send either of them for Chinese enrichment or tuition before P1 and have managed to hold out pretty well to now, we'll see how P3 goes. The boys enjoyed their time with Sunflower, and we were very blessed to have met some wonderful parents and children as well. As with all things, your experience and perception may vary from mine, but I think there's generally no real need to be too uptight about nursery/kindergarten life. Our children, like us before them, will grow up and become their own persons in spite of whatever their parents do or don't do. Sunflower was good for parents like us because we really didn't have to bother much about how the boys were doing - they did well. All the best to Angela, Dennis, and the rest of the team!",0.2860240334378266,1,"['sunflower', 'parent', 'boy', 'centre', 'branch', 'important', 'nursery', 'old', 'need', 'month', 'enjoy', 'life', 'infantcare', 'enrichment', 'kindergarten', 'find', 'good', 'child', 'chinese', 'like']",Sunflower Baby House & Preschool

That's why my daughter enjoy every single day in school and in fact she look forward to return to school after holiday. The most amazing thing is early this year, my daughter came home asking me about the Ukraine war!. Only then I realize my daughter also learn about the world news and she actually learned and display empathy to the kids in Ukraine. We are glad that she wanted us to do donation and see what we can help the kids in Ukraine. At the same time, I manage to teach her about the importance of army in Singapore Enrolling her in upper bukit timah branch is the best decision that we have made. Throughout the past 4 years, the teacher turnover rate is low which is good for student. If I remember correct, teacher lixin has been with us for for the past 3 years. Whenever I fetch my daughter, I can see that every teachers is genuinely caring towards all kids. The action from the teachers can be seen and felt.

"Terrible 'school'. It was apparent to us in our short time there that the centre is a business and not a school that cares for children. The school principal Ms V was unprofessional and seemed disinterested in the well-being of the children. Shady and avoidant responses were frequently given. She constantly dismiss our concerns. The facilities are dirty and not well-maintained. Children's feet are black during pick up and the shoes area stink. There were several sickness outbreak incidents that were not handled promptly. We caught HFMD AND covid within our first month there. Let alone other viruses. School staff pushes the blame to viruses in our home environment. The communication from the school was poor. I was never informed of any important events or issues let alone daily updates regarding my child. The list goes on... After asking around, we learned from other families that they do not particularly know why they still remain in the school and their children didn't thrive in this centre. See shocking text messages circulating in the community below. School principal Ms V does not seem to care. While I can appreciate each individual teacher and helper at the school, the staff as a whole seemed overwhelmed and unable to provide sufficient support to the children. I worried about the quality of care provided to my child on a daily basis. It was an exhausting period for us and I would not recommend this child care center to any parent.

"I would like to compliment all the teachers and staffs in Star Learners @ Sengkang Sports Centre on their wonderful teaching skills and all care they gave to the children. All the contribution from them lead to the wonderful improvement in my children's performance during the years. Principal Mrs Diana always keeps a very positive direction for the school which provided educational and interesting activities for both parents and children. The activities were not only simple interesting but also very meaningful. Children visited the Singapore Health Board to learn how to have a healthy habit in their daily life, they went to the Peranakan Museum to explore different culture and they went to Air Base Museum to have hands on experience to the airplanes.  The school also organised many parents-child activities. For example, the Father‚Äôs Day celebration were held always in a form of sports competition and activities. It was not only making the father and children closer, but also reminds the importance of health. For Mother‚Äôs Day, centre also organised very meaningful talks for mothers and grandmothers, such as ‚ÄúHow important is regular gynaecological check-up‚Äù. The activities were not only help to widen children‚Äôs knowledge, but also show great care to the parents. The teachers in the school are very knowledgeable and responsible to all the children, for both academic results and their daily life. My daugher is a quiet girl and always shy to speak out. With Teacher Nasreen and Xiao Lao Shi‚Äôs teach and help, she is now much more confident than previous. She got great improvement in academic performance in English, Math and Chinese. She has also acquired deep interest in the above subjects with teachers‚Äô encouragement. My son is always too active and sometime naughty. However, with the care from Yu Lao Shi and Teacher Liza, he learnt how to behave himself well and how to be a polite and nice boy. Both also received care from all the teachers and staffs in the centre. Aunty Yati helps to provide a clean environment to them and Aunty Toh always prepares healthy and delicious food for them. As working parents, we can leave children with Star Learners without any worry. My girl is graduating this year, and the brother will have another 2 years with Star Learners. Star Learners is more like a family to my children.

"As parents, we might have given them some hard time from time to time, but these teachers from Sengkang Sport have performed outstandingly well in our opinion. We would like to highlight their strength and give thanks to teachers of N2 for the effort that they have put forth this year. Teacher Liza ============= This year we manage to see Teacher Liza on a more prominent role as the N2 English teacher. As parents we are very happy on how she manages the class. She is firm when needed, as N2 class is more discipline and in order when going on excursion and also gentle when students needed her. As our daughter easily get bored and learn fast on certain situation, Teacher Liza will at times teach her some new songs and also learn basic math calculation while waiting for the kids' turn to go to the toilet, making learning fun by using elements around the environment. From my understanding it is not part of the curriculum at the point of time, and we are much appreciated that Teacher Liza have taken the initiative to do so, to keep our daughter engaging and make learning fun for her. our daugther will always come home waiting to learn to count more stuff and even teach us parents new songs. At time Teacher Liza has try to follow up on how daugther is doing at home to understand our daugther character more in dept. We truely appreciate her effort and care for our daughter. Yu Liaoshi =========== Last year we were really impressed with Yu Liaoshi. And this year is no different. We truly appreciate Yu Liaoshi patient for teaching our daughter Chinese. Our daugther will come home excited to tell us all the beautiful Chinese words to practise and dance. Coming from a non-chinnese speaking family, at times it is very hard to follow up with our daugther's Chinese language. Yu Liaoshi have been very helpful explaining to us parents on what our daugther have learn in school and also show us books during previous PTC on our daugther favourite Chinese book in class and share abit about the book story. As parents we love to follow up with our daugther after school and Yu Liaoshi have gone her way to write down the han-yu pi-yin on the home activities for Syafiqah, making it possible for us to do so. We truely appreciate that she have gone out of her way to assist us and be very patient on teaching our daughter. N2 Teachers ============ For the past 2 years, our daughter had to deal with teacher from her class leaving the school. And at times we are worried for our daughter development as she could get very attached to a teacher one day and suddenly her favourite teacher leaving the other day. We are very happy that Teacher Liza and Yu Liaoshi have been around for the whole of this year to guide our daugther development. Both of them are excellence teachers and work in sync with each other. Making our experience with the school engaging, interactive and worry free as we know our daugther is in good hands. As parents we would love to see both Teacher Liza and Yu Liaoshi be guiding our daugther through K1, as some of her friends (Best friends included) will be leaving school for MOE kindergarten next year. And having both Teacher Liza and Yu Liaoshi will really help our daugther go true these hard times. School Development =================== This year we saw much of the school rebranding and we parents really welcome and appreciate the school effort to make things easy for us parents and teachers. There were bugs in the school app in the beginning, which was expected for any new software. At times bugs like not receiving app notification, not receiving invoices and etc happen and the school principle and teachers have been very helpful in relaying information to parents, to bridge in the gap. We are happy that the app has made things easy and more secure for parents to view school activities photos, invoices, e-consent, buying of uniform and much much more.",0.25043943576552263,4,"['teacher', 'daugther', 'school', 'time', 'parent', 'yu', 'liaoshi', 'year', 'liza', 'daughter', 'learn', 'appreciate', 'home', 'chinese', 'teach', 'class', 'go', 'hard', 'follow', 'app']",Star Learners @ Sengkang Sports Centre | Preschool & Childcare
"My girl has been with the centre since 2015 and graduating this year. My boy is now in PG. Teachers came and left, and each one of them had always left a deep impression on my children, especially Nayli, who is graduating this year. The smiles that the teachers put on every morning, greeting the children when they are dropped at school, makes it so welcoming for the children. To us parents, who might always look like we are in a rush to drop them off so that we can run off to work, seeing the smiles and the cheery ""Good morning!"" or ""Zhao an!"" never fails to uplift my mood for the start of the day. The staff were truly accommodating, especially in ensuring that Zuhaily is being managed better in the school, which at times will mean that Nayli has to be taken out of her class to reassure Zuhaily that everything will be alright. The staff have always been prompt in updating the goods and bads that happened in the centre albeit I cannot deny the fact that my heart jumps everytime I receive a call from the centre. However, deep down inside I know that the teachers are trying their best to do as much as they can. The occasional video updates given to me. It just reassures me that I made the right choice enrolling my kids into Star Learners. Zuhaily had a new English teacher this year, Ms Gill. Her addition to the centre was a nice complement to the centre as well. Zuhaily comes back and will excitedly share the things that he did in school, and most importantly, he remembers what has been done. He will make it a point to get us to read the personalised Children's Day card that Ms Gill has written for him. The occasional updates written about Zuhaily in the comm book is also much appreciated. Thank you Ms Gill! The teachers adore Zuhaily so much and I am so thankful that he is given so much love. What heartens me the most is when Nayli took so much time and effort to write a personalised message for each of the teachers on her cards for Teachers' Day. That is just a reflection of how much of an impression the teachers have left on her, does not matter whethere they are in direct contact with her or not. And enrolling Ms Siti into her Kids' Club? That sounds very exclusive. The Chinese teachers, namely Xiao LaoShi, Yu LaoShi, Zhang LaoShi and Meng LaoShi have been doing such a good job in teaching Mandarin in a fun way, given that Mandarin is not our Mother Tongue. Occasionally, Zuhaily will break into Mandarin at home when we are playing or reading. It has also been useful for both Nayli and Zuhaily to engage with our elderly neighbour who only communicates in Mandarin. Ms Nasreen has done such a wonderful job in preparing Nayli for Primary 1. It is highly engaging and teaching them and preparing them for the real life cum next year. I appreciate the time when she was trying to educate Nayli the importance of being humble. Thankiew Ms Gan for loving Zuhaily so much. He will always remember his pet name, Ali Baba. :) Thankiew Ms Siti for being such a comfort to Zuhaily, knowing that you are someone whom he can turn to when he feels insecure in school. In fact, you have such a warm personality that both my children can attest to that. Ms Zilla is also a teacher who makes effort to make things fun for the children, and i feel that she can totally let loose just to ensure that the children listen and enjoy their learning. Thankiew Ms Liza for teaching fun dance moves to the children during the special events in school. And Mrs Diana, thank you for always being attentive to the needs of the parents and the children, and as a principal of the centre, i am truly impressed that you take time to connect with the children and remembers all their names as well! :) I have never regretted my decision to put my children in Star Learners @ North East.",0.24300384359908175,2,"['zuhaily', 'child', 'ms', 'teacher', 'nayli', 'centre', 'school', 'time', 'laoshi', 'good', 'mandarin', 'year', 'thankiew', 'update', 'write', 'leave', 'give', 'fun', 'day', 'remember']",Star Learners @ Sengkang Sports Centre | Preschool & Childcare
"My Daughter had switched from another childcare centre to Starlearners@SK Sports Centre in January 2018 as N2. And for my Son had started schooling as N1 this year January 2019. We have no regrets to place both of our kids in Starlearners Sports Centre branch, because we can see their growth! Most importantly, they love their teachers Ms Sitti, Ms Zhang, Ms Zila, Ms Meng and Teacher Assistant Ms Gan very much! I can tell that they love the Principal, Aunty Toh and Aunty Yati too, because whenever my kids talk about them, they are always so happy! Under the tremendous care and concern given by the School's Staffs, we as parents, are absolutely very happy to see our children are well-taken care of and they enjoy going to the school. ==================================== Beginning of¬†this year 2019, I am very worried about my Daughter's phonics because alot of my surrounding friends sent their kids for external Phonics class. I didn't send my girl to any external enrichment class, as I do not want to stress my kid. So, I had called up Ms Sitti to have a talk with her & get her advices. With her assurance, I had told my hubby to give our daughter some time. And at home, I will try to recap her phonics and what she had learnt from school. Sometimes, my girl will tell me,"" Ms Sitti said this is a magic word!""¬† I guess she is learning Phonics well in a fun way. Indeed, we had seen progression in our Daughter's phonics along the way. Many thanks to Ms Sitti's way of teaching Phonics to her. As for my Son's 2nd day of school, he cried badly when I walked away and hide myself during his naptime. Ms Zhang is very patient in handling him and manage to coax him to sleep. He kept crying and do not want to school in Jan and Feb. However, Ms Meng Or Ms Zhang will always help to calm him down. Slowly, my boy had started to adapt himself and love going to school. Apart from that, his communication in English had improved too..Thank u, Ms Zila for teaching him English! At times, our Son do catch my hubby and me in surprise, when he speaks English. =) All these efforts are really worth complimenting for... ==================================== Lastly, I must take this chance to thank the Principal Mrs Diana! She is a very passionate and dedicated Principal! Take for recent case about the long overdue referral fee that I had brought up to her. It was supposed to be my friend's child Centre Principal's job to settle it, but Mrs Diana made an attempt to followup closely and reminded that Centre Principal about it. I really appreciate her effort for making the extra miles. Cheers to Mrs Diana's great mentorship, Passionate Teachers and Caring Support Staffs, who make me totally feel no regrets in placing both of my kids there! =) Thank u for all the love to my children! ‚ù§",0.22134589947089947,5,"['ms', 'school', 'phonic', 'centre', 'kid', 'principal', 'daughter', 'thank', 'love', 'sitti', 'diana', 'mrs', 'tell', 'child', 'english', 'zhang', 'way', 'son', 'send', 'learn']",Star Learners @ Sengkang Sports Centre | Preschool & Childcare

"My child is in N1. The teacher dont provide any updates about my child in school. Enrolled in 1 Mar 2022. Other than first week of school the form teacher Fina provide update on my child progress, after that totally no updates from the teacher on how is my child coping/behaving in school. No monthly updates or quarter review from the school about child performance. Checked with my friends from other schools, their school/teacher provide monthly updates to the parent on the child performance. Whenever we ask the form teacher on how is my daughter doing in school, she‚Äôll just say oh she‚Äôs adapting well, just a general remark from the teacher. Since May, my daughter is toilet trained and weaned of diapers at home other than nap/night time. When we inform the teacher about it, they say we have to work hand in hand. But end up, the school didn‚Äôt assist her with toilet training. When ask the form teacher on training, she got defensive and said ‚Äúas I told you the other time, we have to work hand in hand.‚Äù Back then already informed her my girl is potty trained but the form teacher/school is not assisting on this. I can send my girl in at 10am and pick her up at 5pm, 6 diapers were used and this is a common sight. Form teacher didn‚Äôt bother to inform us of any extra curriculum activity that is happening in school. There isn‚Äôt any on boarding or introduction when we enroll our kid in. For example, the school have their own app. The form teacher said will have a walkthrough with us and briefly explain to us on the app. We asked her several times on the app, she just say y‚Äôall explore it on your own. We weren‚Äôt aware that if the school have any announcement or notice will be communicated to parent via the app. It‚Äôs only after the teacher said we didn‚Äôt provide our consent for a certain activity that is happening in school, then we are aware that, oh any formal communication is shared via the app. Withdrawing my child at the end of July 2022, because of the N1 form teacher attitude, constantly emphasizing as I mentioned to you before bla bla bla... The school informed that school fees were not deducted from CDA account. I filled in the giro application form during the enrollment, but apparently the form wasn‚Äôt submitted, not sure where the form went or it got leaked out. As no deduction were made nor did the bank contact me with regards to the giro arrangement. The Chinese teacher were very nice and treat my daughter well, as my daughter mentioned that the lao Shi will coax her to sleep, and play with her. But the turnover rate for the Chinese teachers is quite high. From Mar to July, in the span of 4 months, 3 teachers left and joined the class.

I am delighted to share that my son had a fantastic experience at Star Learner's at Yio Chu Kang, and he was warmly welcomed by the new principal, teachers, friends, and the caring staff at Star Learner's at Bedok. One of the aspects that impressed me about Star Learner's is their approach to teaching. They have a monthly theme that is incorporated into the main books and accompanying materials. Through these themed activities, the children explore and grasp important concepts. Additionally, Star Learner's emphasizes discipline and instills the values of courage, integrity, and grit in preschoolers. It's not just about academics; the children also learn valuable social skills and the importance of giving back and being responsible citizens. I cannot speak highly enough of the teachers at Star Learner's. They are dedicated and passionate about their work, and their commitment to the children's well-being is evident. The principal, lunch staff, and cleaning staff are all courteous and show genuine care for the kids. It's clear that they have a customer-centric attitude, making the experience even more pleasant for both parents and children. The highlight of the year for K2 graduates is the Graduation concert, which showcases the children's growth and achievements. It's a wonderful celebration that creates lasting memories for the children and their families. In conclusion, I wholeheartedly recommend Star Learner's at Bedok to any parents who genuinely care about their children's future.

To give u some examples of their way of managing the centre:no visitors other than parents allowed(not even for a young kid who needs much adjustment to the new environment. Even parents, the director Sharon told me strictly 3visits per week allowed), cold attitudes towards visitors including grand parents, young sister of the child and caregivers. All parents and caregivers, when you hear your child crying for help in such a centre by behaving strangely at home after school, who could you ask for help from? I bet no one other than to rethink your decision to send your child there coz I believe there are many better ones out there.

"We have had the absolute pleasure of sending our two-year-old to Small Wonder at Serangoon North and we cannot express enough how thrilled we are with the experience. From the moment we stepped foot inside the school, we knew it was the perfect place for our little one's early education. First and foremost, the teachers and staff are incredible. They are warm, nurturing, and genuinely care about each child's well-being. Their dedication to fostering a positive and engaging learning environment is evident in everything they do. Our child has developed strong bonds with their teachers, who go above and beyond to make them feel safe, loved, and excited to come to school every day. The curriculum is outstanding. It strikes a perfect balance between structured learning and play-based activities. Our little one has thrived in this environment, acquiring essential skills while having a ton of fun. We have witnessed tremendous growth in their cognitive, social, and emotional development during their time at the preschool. The teachers use creative and innovative teaching methods to make learning enjoyable, and we are amazed at how much our child has learned in such a short period. The classrooms are bright, spacious, and thoughtfully designed to stimulate young minds. The outdoor play areas are fantastic, providing ample space for exploration and physical activity. We appreciate the school's commitment to safety and cleanliness, ensuring that our child is in a healthy environment at all times. Communication with the preschool has been exceptional. The staff maintains open lines of communication with parents, keeping us informed about our child's progress, daily activities, and any special events. They are always available to address our concerns or answer any questions we may have. This level of involvement and transparency is reassuring as a parent. Finally, the sense of community is remarkable. The school organizes various events and parent involvement activities that promote a strong bond between families and staff. We have had the opportunity to connect with other parents and build lasting friendships, creating a support system that extends beyond the classroom walls. In conclusion, we wholeheartedly recommend Small Wonder at Serangoon North to any parent seeking a nurturing and enriching environment for their child.

"Love this centre at first sight -The HUGE indoor playground, the conducive environment, and the BIG space for the kids to grow and spend their full day makes me soooo excited when I first visited the centre in 2015. We decided to move 3 of our kids from a childcare centre right below our blk to Small Wonder @ SN as we know that they will love going to school and be as excited as me if they were to see this exciting place. From the curriculum to the daily healthy menu plus the indoor playground which is as big as a HDB 5-room flat (Yes, I'm not kidding!), what more can we ask for when we are looking for a full day centre for our little kiddos? When HFMD was rising in numbers, the school made a firm decision to stop all parents from entering the centre and adopted drop-off at entrance. This has caused much inconvenience to the school as they are highly shorthanded and teachers are supposed to be in the class with their students. I applaud them to go the extra mile just to ensure that the HFMD numbers are controlled to create that safe environment for the kiddos. When I had my #4, I know straight away where to send her to. The infant teachers gave us daily updates via a booklet on meals, diaper change, nap and activities of my baby - and even allow me to breastfeed my baby as and when I need (during non-covid days). Every morning when I send my 8 months old baby in, the assurance the teachers gave me allows me to stay focus on my work. A few dedicated teachers along the way has tear with us when we face some problems with the kids and walk through the changes with us. I can still remember how Karen (current centre principal) walks through with me when I am emotionally shaken with my twin boy who cannot stay focus in class. They never give up on any child and Karen spent a good few hours talking and listening to me while I pour my concern to her. Another incident was during the first few days of school, my eldest was still not familiar with the new faces and was crying before entering school. Shortly after I reached office (still thinking if she can cope), Karen whatsapp me with photos of my child playing happily with her friends in class. I am actually taken by surprise when I received the whatsapp pic as I'm not expecting any school to give real time updates to parents as they have too many kids to look after. Of course after seeing that photo, I can focus more @ work. Teachers who don't teaches our kids takes the effort to remember our kids by their names which makes the kids comfortable when they enter the school every morning. During Circuit Breaker Days, most of our friends' childcare has no HBL and kids are just given random worksheets to work on for the 2 months. But in SW, the teachers did up the HBL curriculum to engage the kids within a very short time frame. From reading to singing and experimental crafts, we were amazed on how fast they get to turnaround this whole episode to engage the kids. Not to mention that there was even a courier arranged to deliver some books to the kids as part of the engagement. This allows the kids to stay engaged with their teachers and peers, and has no fear on returning back to school when school reopens. My eldest had graduated in SW in 2018 - but each time when she fetches the younger siblings with us, the teachers still hug and call out to her and Children's day present was given to her through her younger siblings every year without fail. My twins will be graduating this year (2020). Afterwhich, I will have my youngest who will be graduating in 2022. All in all, we had spent a good 5 years with Small Wonder @ SN and still counting on. Generally, my kids love school and now says 'bye mummy' to me every morning. Small Wonder had taken away my biggest worry on daycare for my kids and this is exactly what we need as parents. We are glad that we had found this school and met all the dedicated teachers and principal along the way. When my youngest graduate in 2022, we are definitely going to miss this childcare.",0.14193581418581416,3,"['kid', 'school', 'teacher', 'centre', 'day', 'give', 'young', 'graduate', 'time', 'enter', 'focus', 'year', 'karen', 'work', 'big', 'wonder', 'love', 'morning', 'spend', 'stay']",Small Wonder Preschool (Serangoon)
"My child has been enrolled in this branch for almost 2 years since infant and now he is nearing end of N1. The teachers I had encountered with are patient, caring and committed. Every morning, I see different class teachers and their Admin doing temperature taking, checking for hfmd and sanitization. It seem like the teachers are rotated to the duties. Some teachers could even remember my son, despite not teaching him before. (maybe my son was to naughty?) Whenever there is sickness out break, the senior teacher or principal would send email updating us on the condition till the outbreak ended. My child normally arrived at 7.30am, he will be gathered in a room with the other early arrivals. I will see 1 or 2 teachers taking care of them. My son enjoy that moment as he got to interact with his buddy. At around 8am, his form teacher will fetch him n classmates to class. Via their little lives platform, I could see my son weekly activities like painting, exploring snails, reading, presenting his toy, story telling etc etc.... This gives me some knowledge of what he had learnt in school. He could even share with me or sing the songs. Recently they implemented student card for parents to fetch their child/children . Without the card, they will not release the child. One child has 2 student card. Despite this is a good implementation, but I think the card can be easily duplicated at home. Maybe having barcode or QR code to identify the child will be better? There was a period of time, when my son was constantly misbehaving and restless, his class teacher (yang Laoshi) called me to check on him. She gave me some suggestions on handling him at home and it works. After a period of time, she would follow up and feedback if there is any improvement. I appreciate her commitment and helpfulness. Comparing with my friends children's teacher from other school, they never experienced as such. I told the teacher to try ensuring my son drinks at least 2 bottle of water a day. They did it by judging from the empty water bottle and my son health. If he didn't drink enough, he will start to cough and his dry lip. However there are times where the teacher couldn't, she would honestly inform me when I fetch him. I appreciate her integrity. To be honest, I felt exhausted just taking care of 1 child and the teachers are taking care of about 15 children per class so how can I blame them for overlooking such trival matter. To me, their principal, Karen is experienced and clear on the objectives of children learning. When I spoke to her on an incident of my son, she could analyze the situation by bringing me to see the full picture and giving me suggestions on what they can commit to avoid the incidents. She is confident in her words that convinced me. I am particular in leader behaviors and attitude where Karen had shown the positive side. I believe a good leader will develop good soldiers. Needn't to say, her suggestion works. My overall experience with the school has been positive. Their way of teaching suit my son well. After all this is a pre-school, I would not expect my son to be sitting on the chair listening and doing homework all day (9hrs?) It will be fun when they learn thru play, presenting their favorite toys to friends etc.. It develop their confidence thru interest. I will recommend friends to this school and it's team. üëç",0.17715367965367967,1,"['teacher', 'child', 'son', 'school', 'class', 'card', 'fetch', 'give', 'good', 'learn', 'take', 'friend', 'suggestion', 'care', 'time', 'etc', 'like', 'maybe', 'karen', 'day']",Small Wonder Preschool (Serangoon)

"""I am compelled to share my concerns about Skool4kidz Fernvale Campus, particularly regarding their inconsistent rules and practices in comparison to other campuses. There are notable disparities in rules and practices compared to other campuses like Yishun and Punggol, which allow parents to celebrate birthdays with their children in class. Unfortunately, Fernvale's management lacks consideration for children's well-being by excluding parents from birthday celebrations. This exclusion extends beyond birthdays, as the management seems narrow-minded regarding events and new student inclusion. A recent example was a carnival planned for December 9th, where new students were initially overlooked until I raised the issue. The last-minute RSVP demand by 5 the day of notification is impractical for working parents, showcasing a disregard for their schedules. Moreover, the school's lack of support for breastfeeding mothers is questionable and contradicts government encouragement. Conflicting information about a separate fridge designated for breast milk and medicine storage adds to the confusion. The staff's refusal to assist with one feeding per day due to resource constraints raises concerns and contradicts both government recommendations and the child's well-being. Additionally, misinformation during orientation, lack of timely updates, and administrative inefficiencies, including a staff causing inconvenience with uniform promotions, contribute to an overall unpleasant experience. The campus administration's dismissive attitude towards feedback further adds to the frustration. Overall, my experience with Fernvale Campus has been marked by disappointment and a lack of consideration for the well-being of both students and parents.

My youngest looks forward to messy/water play and nature time, and my oldest enjoys his lessons and PlayClub - lunchtime activities for kids who don't nap. But it's not all play too, in K2 there's a lot more focus on academics (perhaps more than I'd like but I understand the school is trying to prepare the kids for P1).

"""Nice teachers and principal they have a great set up. However, it‚Äôs not recommended for children who are not Mandarin speaking . My friends child was in Nursery/playgroup and because the class was small so instead of having a English speaking main teacher and a mandarin speaking teacher for mandarin classes as the school originally communicated when signing up , the school had engaged the mandarin teacher to be the main teacher who could not speak a word of English(not even good morning)and this was not communicated to the parents . Unfortunately the parents only noticed this 3-6months in when the child started to show signs of fright to speak because the poor child felt no one understands him in school. The child is now in another school with an English main teacher and the child‚Äôs progression in speaking has since improved very well with additional help from enrichment classes to help over come the fear to speak. I believe other upper classes with more students have English main teachers and should have a balance curriculum with both English and mandarin speaking teachers. Just be sure to reiterate the main teachers English speaking when enrolling the child to be able to communicate with your child, as this may cause the child trauma especially at a very young age when they feel no one understands them in school.

"My son started attending riverlife kindergarten school at 2 years old as pre nursery to n1 and we can really see the big progress. My son have become active from shy type, For a 2 year old he can easily get distracted on the environment but the teachers have patience to teach, he was able to read words which we we didn‚Äôt teach as we are busy parents. From there you can really see that the teachers are focusing on every students, not like simply teach and the rest will be on your kid. Teachers really engage the students to be active and to participate on any activities. They teach good values. One of the things that i like most are the videos/ small clips they share weekly for example cooking, reading words, writing letter, drawing, playing as a group/team and so on. These clips really help parents to get an idea on what their kids are up to, I was happy when i saw my son dancing on the videos as he don't usually do at home. As a parent you feel proud and shocked that they can do this. Hope they maintain sending those clips. Principal and teachers are really hands-on as you will notice how they interact with the parents after school. You will see them asking how are things? They even memorize all the names of all the students going in and out. They will also give small feedback / observation to your son to help you understand your kid more. At the end of the term there would be a video call to give the feedback on your kid, The positive feedback and the things to improve on, which is very good. The curriculum on this school is really advance, its like they are two level up on their current level but with no pressure off-course. I have said advance, as due to unfortunate things i needed to move house and move my son to nearby school. Now my son is settled on his new school as n2 and to my surprise, whatever they are teaching here are already been covered in pre nursery of riverlife.

"Rainbow Cove at Alexandra is truly a haven for little ones! Our experience with their infant and child care services has been absolutely exceptional. Both Maevis and Davis have thrived under the loving care of the dedicated staff at Rainbow Cove. Maevis, our eldest, began attending when she was 7 months old, while Davis joined at 2 months old. From the moment we enrolled them, we were impressed by the warmth and professionalism of the team. The children responded with smiles and giggles, and the teachers even went the extra mile to ensure we received pictures of their joyful moments. The caregivers at Rainbow Cove are not just professionals; they are genuine caregivers who create a nurturing and safe environment for the children. Their genuine care is evident in their dedication to each child's well-being and development. One notable example is when Maevis was diagnosed with erb's palsy on her left arm at just 8 months old. I requested the teachers to perform rehabilitation exercises with her, and within a month, Maevis showed significant improvement. its clear to me that the teachers put in the effort for Maevis. Moreover, the facility itself is well-designed and equipped with everything necessary for a child's growth and exploration. The colorful and stimulating environment fosters creativity and learning. Maevis particularly enjoyed riding the trike and playing with friends in the outdoor area. Rainbow Cove is more than just a childcare center; it's a community that values the unique needs of each child. We are immensely grateful to the fantastic team at Rainbow Cove for providing an enriching and loving environment for Maevis and Davis. Although we have sadly moved to another part of Singapore and are no longer with Rainbow Cove, we want to express our heartfelt gratitude to all the teachers at Rainbow Cove @ Alexandra for showering both of our children with love and attention during their time there.

"Our baby boy started at Rainbow Cove when he was five and a half months. I worked out a transition plan with the Principal, Ms. Jay, to have his start slowly (in the end of January, before Covid)- only a couple hours a day for three days after Chinese New Year. During those days, I saw that the teachers were all very professional and, above all, they were very passionate. I could clearly witness that taking care of those babies was much more than just a job. After the second day, my new mom jitters were gone. Our baby boy always has a big smile on his face when he gets to school. It has been more than half a year now (with confinement in between) and I feel that I can‚Äôt say enough good things about our experience with Rainbow Cove. We are very thankful to all staff.

Every day children do lots of interesting activities to activate the children‚Äôs minds and body. This happened even when we had the lockdown in April/ May. There were online lessons and we were sent activities that children could complete at home. In addition, we are sent pictures and videos via WhatsApp of our babies almost daily. I truly appreciate the time invested in taking those pictures and videos because they make my day at work. Having such close communication with the teachers makes us feel more involved and at ease, reassuring us that our boy is happy, and he is learning new skills with his little friends. At the end of the day when we go and pick our baby, we always get verbal updates too. We also have the daily handwritten personalized booklet to let us know how our son‚Äôs day went. Last but not least, Rainbow Cove is very clean and safe. We feel very fortunate to have our son in such environment!

We enrolled since kid was 20mths old and are very appreciative of how they've helped our kid to become a better version of himself. Pedagogy & Curriculum - we were initially attracted to RKI YCK for its bilingual curriculum and large playground. but the school offers way more than that. The pedagogy encourages self-discovery through play, a love for learning, cultivating good life habits & values, and developing an inquisitive mindset. Food - your kid will eat hearty, healthy balanced meals; way better than the typical office workers' meals. Our kid took a liking to fruits thanks to RKI YCK. RKI YCK has a selective hiring process. They've got a great team who take the effort to design and deliver lessons that engage and stimulate the kids way better than tired parents can - by four, they're exposed to discussing current affairs, singing chinese tang poems and songs, and develop an understanding of complex concepts / events through decomposition into simpler ideas. Kid was definitely way less resistant to learning mandarin than I was at his age. Facilities-wise - the school is clean and well maintained kudos to the hardworking support team of chefs and assistants disinfecting and cleaning up after the kids everyday. kids are not the most hygiene-conscious and it is a commendable effort keeping bugs at bay.

Initially it worried me a little, whether she would adapt well or enjoy her new school The teachers were very patient and dedicated in helping her to adjust and adapt very quickly. She looks forward to going to school everyday. Teachers would greet us every morning with a chirpy tone, and consistently update us on our child‚Äôs progress. In these 2 years, she has become more confident in speaking, and will always share with us her experiences and knowledge learnt in school. From not knowing how to speak Mandarin, my girl is now conversing with us in Mandarin at home. She looks forward to having her Spellings & Âê¨ÂÜôs every week, which really helped prep her for P1!

"In 2018, it was our hard decision to send our only son to childcare at 20 months old. We found RKI Punggol and selected this school, believing that our son Haemil will be in good hands. RKI school is a professional preschool and childcare, on what the claim. The program is an excellently balanced work-play schedule, teaching in bilingual, English, and Chinese. As a result, Haemil is always happy coming to school and enjoys his time with teachers and classmates. (And most of the time, he doesn't want to go home). He joined RKI Punggol from PG to K2 (10.12.2022 graduation day). We can see good development in him from year to year. The environment is essential in molding a child's attitude and behavior. A good school with a pleasant atmosphere, professional teachers, and high-standard management must be considered when selecting a preschool for your beloved one. Although I often travel abroad for work, I never worry and often see the updated activities from school apps. RKI constantly improves school programs, which are innovative for new activities, increasing child's exploration. All RKI kids are unique; they grow up well, are intelligent, love each other, and always be happy with their interests. Furthermore, the RKI team always listens to the feedback and is transparent with the parent, improving to a higher standard each year. They also did very well during the crisis of Covid 19. We appreciated and thumbed up for the team. (from management, principal, teachers/laoshi, cleaners, and cookers). My husband and I appreciate your care for the past five years. We thank you for being a good part of his growth from a baby to a boy: Principal Gwen, Yu Laoshi, Tr Emily, and his past teachers: Liu Laoshi, Tr Raye, Tr Jo, Tr Amina, and Han Laosi. (Also, special thanks for his Laoshi; Haemil never communicates in Chinese at home because his mummy is Thai.

"We have enrolled our child (Pre-Nursery) since Jan 2022 and it has been a great journey. The Principal (Gwen) and Teachers were great and there was clear and open conversation throughout. It took our child about 2 weeks to settle in and soon, going to school was no longer a chore. If you child asks to go to school, you know the school must be doing something right. We also like that there is a playground within the school compound and an area to play with 'cars and bikes'. They also practice quite a bit of common sense and allow snacks to be packed for your child if you have a later pick up time. The teachers were engaging, enthusiastic, friendly and most importantly, able to build rapport with our child quickly. This helped to ease our initial concerns and worries. Whatever our queries, we just had to input it into the e-commsbook and it would be usually answered within a day. Photos were also sent there although we would have loved more photos (what is enough is subjective though üò¨). The curriculum has a good mix of outdoor and indoor play. We see quite a bit of arts and craft and hands on experiential learning. We can also see them trying to teach numbers and alphabets. But frankly at this age, we are just happy that she wants to go to school. There were also small thoughtful gestures like rinsing the milk bottles after use so that we will have an easier time cleaning later. A smaller centre also means a little less falling sick and more attention on your child. The only downside is the centre's location in the middle of a private estate so when it rains, it can get quite difficult. The closest LRT station is Punggol Point and it is about a 10 mins walk in. Road closures around the Punggol Road area also means you can only access the centre by Punggol Way (Northshore). So in summary, no complaints or issues with the school thus far.

I guess as working parents, although it wud have been lovely to be there to experience the journey with the children, it was nice not being pressured to take time off from work to go through all the school trips. I understand there are schools that do not allow the child to participate out of school trips if the parents are unable to join. This is good because our child still gets to experience as much out of school education despite our working hours (mind you I do 3 shifts so this was truly appreciated by me). The only few downfalls that we experienced was deductions of school fees and costs for events and trips. We had to multiple times get bounced back and fourth between the school and the bank saying that deduction was unsuccessful despite sufficient value. Ended up paying personally at school almost every month. And the cost to attend graduation concert and some of the outdoor trips is quite steep for preschoolers. All in all, if it was not for MOE kindergarten availability in a school that is 3 minutes walk from our house, we would have continued our child to complete her pre-school journey with Raffles Kidz Punggol.",0.2654947916666667,2,"['school', 'child', 'parent', 'trip', 'time', 'experience', 'work', 'teacher', 'cost', 'despite', 'outdoor', 'journey', 'get', 'deduction', 'old', 'good', 'play', 'enrol', 'include', 'lesson']",Raffles Kidz @ Punggol √É¬¢√Ç¬Ä√Ç¬ì Best Childcare Centre and Preschool
"When we first enrolled, our child had a pair of passionate Teachers and the previous Principal was on the ball and you can tell the effort the team puts in. But in 2021, returning after the first wave of covid, we noticed our child‚Äôs changed behaviour towards school. The melt down and rejection towards school became more intense. And we noticed that there were lesser books read and the curriculum has been reduced. The new principal‚Äôs responses lack lustre and flippant. And it‚Äôs obvious our child has been watching screens in school to fill time. Not worth your penny for the lack of activities, child engagement and even basic update from teacher was not frequent enough. Better off sending your child to Govt affiliated pre schools which has more curriculum planning.

"my eldest (now p3) attended and graduated from RKI and had a great issue transitioning into primary school. so I wrote in to BP RKI school and management about my concern hoping that they could attend to my concern as my younger 2 children are also enrolled into the RKI BP. to my dismay, they did not respond to my mail and they also did not provide me with a good and honest feedback about my child's academics. my 2nd child was in k1 last year but was not doing well in her phonics and this was not raised during PTM- I was only informed that my child was doing well and same par as her classmates. but when we attend classes outside of RKI, her standard was significantly lower than her peers. not only that, they increased their price without valid justification. when concern is raised, no response or acknowledgement was given. so had to make a hard decision to withdraw my children (going to K2 and N2 in 2024) which was a really hard choice for my K2. my children had become more vocal and independent after attending the new school (which is cheaper than RKI) for only 2 months, and they can actually come home to tell me in details on the plenty of events what they had done in school for the day. which was a vast difference compared to how they were in RKI. it seemed like they practically did nothing for the day when they were in RKI. for the price that RKI is charging , I'm expecting them to be able to deliver results in my child's holistic growth. but sadly it seems like I had hindered my children growth and made it more difficult for them to transition to primary 1 by sending them to RKI.",0.11585297418630752,0,"['rki', 'child', 'school', 'attend', 'concern', 'primary', 'bp', 'hard', 'transition', 'growth', 'raise', 'price', 'like', 'day', 'respond', 'valid', 'able', 'acknowledgement', 'decision', 'deliver']",Raffles Kidz @ Bukit Panjang √É¬¢√Ç¬Ä√Ç¬ì Best Childcare Centre And Preschool

"We enrolled our son in RKI @ BP in Dec2021 when our son turned 19months old. Initially, we chose RKI because there were no other preschools with vacancies and we thought we'll move him out when we get another preschool with lower school fees. In the end, we decided to stay with RKI for these reasons: 1. Our son shows great improvement in many areas even though he just started less than a year ago. 2. Our son looks forward to go to school everyday now. He only cried for the first couple of days of school. That shows how capable the teachers are to be able to get our son to adapt to a new environment. Our son has mild symptoms of autism so getting him to adapt to a new environment was definitely not easy. 3. The teachers are very prompt in replying to us and are very supportive! Shoutout to Teacher Geri and Meiyu Laoshi. Always updating us on our son's behaviour and learning. 4. We like the curriculum and activities in school too! Especially when we get the photo updates from the teachers every now and then on what they did in school. 5. The monthly newsletter is super helpful for us parents who are working and do not really have the time to chase for updates. We'll get photos and descriptions on what was happening monthly. 6. Almost everyday before our son leaves the school, the principal will always say bye to him and high fived him. It really warm our hearts seeing the principal's action. Thank you Teacher Dee!

"This school was chosen over the few others when I was ""shopping"" for a school for my son. Chose this school because of its spaciousness and its own outdoor play area. My son started attending the school when he was about 19 months old. The teachers there helped him settle down into the daily routines quickly and managed to calm him down whenever he cried for me (my son is a mummy's boy). Now in his second year, my boy grows fonder of the school and he enjoys going to school every day. He especially enjoys Art and Gourmet Chef (cookery) lessons as well as outdoor fitness lessons/ playtime. The teachers in the school are polite, patient, caring and dedicated.

That provides more space for the children to learn and play. We transferred our boy over from another childcare center. The teachers were patient and accommodating and that helped him to settle in rather well. We have also enrolled our daughter in and the teachers have been very patient and supportive of her. The launch of the app was very beneficial for parents as we can input into the app comm book any queries that we have. And usually the teachers reply within the day itself. I also like the function 'moment' in the app where teachers will take snapshot of what our own kid is doing in class. Currently the curriculum is moving into montessori approach and instead of changing learning theme monthly, it will be quarterly. Personally I like as this will allow the children to learn more in depth of the theme or topic which they are learning. I enjoy reading the monthly newsletters as it provides me a glimpse of what my children have learnt in the previous month and will be learning in the following month.

"I enrolled my girl to RafflesKids@Bukit Panjang on a full-day program since she was 18 months. She is turning 3 in 2 more months. It has been a pleasant experience since then. During the first month, Teachers would provide updates on my girl every now and then, took photos of her and informed us of any problem or suggestion. The Teachers are responsible, always patient to answer questions and open to suggestions. They are proactive and prompt in informing us on the wellbeing of my girl. Along the way, we are so impressed by the amount of effort that the school put in in preparing teaching materials. For instance, a close to real size milk cow prop for the kids to experience milking. The school adopts thematic teaching and during that month it was about dairy products. Every term, we are informed of the meals menu too. From the food selection, we are again assured that our kids are being well taken care of. The teachers have also done a fantastic job in toilet training. It is really stressless for us parents! The kids are taught useful skills e.g. understand traffic light, road crossing, safety at home etc as young as 2 years old. Parents are informed of learning progress via the monthly bulletin written in bilingual. The school also uses mobile app to maintain comms with parents, including announcement and when kids check in and out of the School with photo evidence. There is also a memory section for Teachers to take precious photos of our child and upload it on the App for our viewing. As a working Mum, bonding time with child can be very limited. Those photos really mean a lot to me at least I get to somehow witness how my child performs in school during my absence. There is an outdoor playground within the school compound. We recognise how important it is for the kids to have space to run around! In fact we are so lucky to have this school near to where we stay in Bukit Panjang. I could see majority of the childcare or preschools here only have indoor facilities. In terms of infection control, I would give 2 thumbs ups. The check is strict and thorough.

At first, I was attracted to the school, the space, the facilities and programs. The teachers are very responsive, patient, and professional as well. Teachers to student ratios are always within recommended limits, and sometimes higher ratio for younger age groups. Pre-covid programs/activities included water play, hands-on cookery, excursions, family days, CNY, moon cake festival etc. School approach focuses more on learning through play + manipulatives to achieve age appropriate goals. I like that they break children into smaller focus groups to practice concepts, which is great for children to have more attention from teachers. Older children build a good foundation for primary school. All in all, a school i would recommend to family and friends who are looking for a good preschool in the vicinity.

"This is a private child care centre which has its own outdoor play area. The dining area resides at the back of the two terrace houses that the school occupies (divider wall torn down) and the children won't be in aircon all day long (personally likes this as this lowers the chances of viruses being spread easily - as compared to being in aircon all day). The children will dine in their respective classrooms during periods such as haze. Children are grouped into the various levels e.g. Pre-nursery & N1, N2, K1 & K2 and placed into different parts of the two terraces (classrooms). I like this arrangement so that the contact between children is minimized (apart for morning assembly and after 5pm) and this would minimize the spreading of virus too. The teachers are patient and nice. I like how updates are provided to parents promptly so that teachers and parents could work with each other for the children's development. The launch of the school app this year was one of the best improvements. With this app, we get updates when our children checked in and out of school and also communication is made easier between the school and parents. We are also updated via the app on our children's development. The school made some changes to the curriculum from this quarter, introducing Montessori-style type of teaching. Hope to see greater improvement to our child's learning with this change. We have seen great process and development in our child from the start last year.

"We started sending our little one to RKI@Bt Pjg when he turned 31 months. The school was under renovation at that time but we saw much potential from it and was also attracted by the lovely outdoor play area. One of the practices unique to the school was they didn‚Äôt allow parents‚Äô accompaniment even on the first day. We felt really unsettled with this restriction but with the teachers assuring us how successful it had been with other children we decided to give it a try. Turned out it worked well with our child. We were especially fond of the Comm Book feature in the app on which you can communicate with the teachers directly. During the first two weeks, the attending teachers have been dedicatedly updating us with pictures and progress which gave us lots of relief. Another thing we really like from the operation aspect is, they observe stringent pupil+parent/authorised personnel check-in/check-out procedures. Although it seemed a little cumbersome, we don‚Äôt mind going through it knowing that the security of the school would never be compromised. What would be perfect is for the school to be openly showing how the curriculum is conducted.

"Dear Farah & Staff of Raffles Kidz@AMK, I am writing to express my heartfelt appreciation for the commendable work, love & care that you have showered upon my daughter. Since my daughter joined your center in June 2023, I have witnessed a tremendous positive impact on her development and growth. The dedication and passion exhibited by your staff have been truly commendable. I often hear my daughter recounting her daily activities, interactions she experienced with her teachers and classmates, over dinner. This is testimony that my daughter is fully engaged and enjoying school. Additionally, the way that my girl dashes to her teachers for morning hugs (on occasions when I was able to send her to school) is sheer evidence that duty of care and rapport building on the part of your teachers is strong. This certainly contributed to my daughter's happiness and positive learning experience. The curriculum and activities provided at your center have not only been educational but also engaging. The diverse range of activities, coupled with the attention to each child's individual needs, has impressed me. The progress I have seen in my daughter's social skills, creativity, and basic motor skills is a testament to the quality of education she is receiving. Thank you for the regular updates of the activities and programmes that my daughter experiences everyday through the communication app. My wife and myself never fail to exclaim in excitement while browsing the photographs and videos that your teachers post every weekend. I must say that the cleanliness and safety measures implemented within the center have provided me with peace of mind, knowing that my daughter is in a secure, safe and hygienic environment. My wife and I are appreciative of the wonderful community you have built, where children enjoy the school experience, are encouraged to learn, explore, and make friends. Your team's efforts are commendable under your leadership, and I cannot thank you and your teachers enough for all the care and love you give to my duaghter and your little charges. Please extend my gratitude to all staff at Raffles Kidz@AMK. I am looking forward to the continued growth and how my girl will blossom under your care, guidance and love.

"Raffles Kidz ticks everything on my checklist for an ideal childcare preschool for my daughter. The top on my list is a school with bilingual curriculum. The most significant change we‚Äôve noticed is our daughter‚Äôs improvement in Chinese. Having being away from Singapore and residing in a non-Chinese speaking country for more than 2 years, my daughter has lost out a lot on formal Chinese lessons. RKI‚Äôs immersive learning environment where teachers carry out conversations in both languages paves the way for children to become effectively bilingual. In fact, just within 5 weeks at RKI, my child could speak to us in simple Mandarin sentences when in the past, she couldn‚Äôt and wouldn‚Äôt. She is also more proactive in speaking and writing Chinese now. Readiness for primary school, yet not being overly academic focus is another factor I look for in a good preschool. RKI‚Äôs holistic development nurtures the whole child with an inquiry-based Montessori approach. Enrichment such as Creative Arts, Science & Discovery, Gourmet Chef, and Chinese Speech and Drama are all part of the curriculum and school fees. During the school tour, I was bowled over by the clean and vibrant environment as well as the facilities. My daughter loves the school so much that she readily went away with the teacher to be engaged in various activities. She also chose this school even though it was only our first school visit of the day. This shows how comfortable she is with the teachers and environment. Another factor I like is that the school is centrally managed and not a franchise. This to me is really important as I can be assured of the quality no matter which branch. My daughter enjoys going to school a lot. She likes all her teachers and friends. She comes home with tummy well fed and mind well stretched, sharing with me General Knowledge and current affairs. 3 months in this school and I‚Äôm impressed by how much she has blossomed.",0.25318627450980397,2,"['school', 'daughter', 'chinese', 'teacher', 'speak', 'child', 'rki', 'environment', 'bilingual', 'curriculum', 'go', 'preschool', 'factor', 'away', 'like', 'lot', 'having', 'engage', 'branch', 'lesson']",Raffles Kidz @ Ang Mo Kio √É¬¢√Ç¬Ä√Ç¬ì Best Childcare Centre and Preschool (along Yio Chu Kang Rd)

"My two boys had fantastic time at Posso @ Jurong East. All teachers and staff helped my boys settle in with affection and patience. They made sure to keep my husband and myself updated on how our kids were doing at the start which is highly appreciated. Admin side - amazingly quick response for any inquiries from finance to teachers. School facilities -a huge outside play ground and green patches to grow veggies. My kids could run around and go out to smell herbs and witness veggies grow. School curriculum - they have varied activities to keep kids happy. My kids' favorites were baking, trampolining and learning Chinese. Many thanks to the principal, Ms Charmaine.

The standard of the school staffs, from teachers, to admin, to curricular planners and even the cleaners has always been of the highest level. The dedication of the staffs is obvious to see from their day-to-day duties as well as quarterly excursions and the annual year-end concerts. The teachers must have spent many after-school and weekend hours preparing the props and doing the rehearsal, to make the year-end concert a success. As for curriculum wise, the school is unique in the sense it advocates the ""I can"" attitude and encourages every child to explore and experience, through gardening activities, baking, science experiments and speech and drama.

"When we step in, we could see that the place is newly renovated, bright, airy, gives a cosy vibe & conducive for learning. This helps break away from the school setting that our son is accustomed to in the morning. With a change in setting, the environment mentally engages his mind and relaxes him, which is a good alternative to home. We like that there is a structured curriculum in place where the teachers provide guidance on his homework and drill him on spellings. There is also focus on each subject a day where worksheets are provided to deepen their understanding. Not to mention, Fridays where he is empowered to do things that interests him like art & craft or just unwinding for the weekend. On top of this, there is paid for enrichment classes conveniently provided under the same roof. This include robotics and maths that we do not need to locate elsewhere. Our son likes the reading corner and enjoys engaging in puzzles with his peers such as Jig saw, Tangram, Pentomino, Sudoko & others. This center goes beyond the basic looking after your child (e.g. relief teacher) but enriches him academically, socially and holistically as it bridges general knowledge of what is happening around us through holiday programs. It does not disconnect him from the world we live in but provide insights and practical activities that could be as simple as folding plastic bags! With the strong program and purpose that it brings, it makes it easier for us to give our son a more balanced childhood as school related work is mainly settled during weekdays while weekends are reserved for sports, leisure & family time. With our son onboard this month and multiple communications over prior months, we could witness that Patricia and her teachers are dedicated and passionate with their callings. They will provide us with timely updates on his progress and practical tips on areas that he can work on. Whenever we have a concern on his learning, they are open to listen and flexible to cater to our needs, where possible. This includes emphasis on mandarin, return transport home and transport from school after CCA & extra classes.

The team of teachers are passionate for the children‚Äôs learning, social emotional well-being, and most importantly‚Äî FUN! The activities organised for the children are catered to their interests and needs, and are very much authentic learning experiences which engage the children‚Äôs 5 senses, and gives them plenty of opportunities to play and work with one another in the great outdoors. It is not your typical preschool where children are forced to sit down and listen to a static, academic lesson from a whiteboard, but instead a play-based school where they are fully immersed and engaged in their learning. Children spend lots of time getting messy and dirty in the sand and rain (with raincoats and boots of course!), creating masterful artworks with paint and loose parts and glue, or simply just having a picnic in the grass patch behind the school. This is not just a great school for young children, but for any potential practicum students who are looking for a unique, vibrant, and out-of-the-norm preschool as an attachment centre.

"As a working mum, it can get difficult at times to juggle the load between work commitments and child care. Enrolling both my children in MFS-RVC has been one of the best choices we have made. It was an intimidating and teary moment to place my firstborn in infant care from the young age of 4 months. With Chen Laoshi's kind reassurance and over time, seeing him thrive in school has put my heart at ease and the decision to also place my 2nd child in infant care was an easy one to make. The teachers at Infant care, Chen Laoshi, Teacher Heeda, Teacher Jenny, treat the children as if their own. It's a joy to see the teachers are always in high spirits, enthusiastically welcoming the children during drop off. When my younger child was unwell and hadn't been to school, Teacher Heeda makes the effort to constantly follow up on her well being even after working hours. This is a testament to how much genuine care the teachers have for the little ones. In terms of curriculum, infants explore activities through sensory play that enhances their listening, language and psychomotor skills. Most of the teaching materials are very creative and often hand made by the teachers themselves through recycled materials. Besides sensory play, teachers also help guide the little ones through tummy time, learning to sit, crawl and walk. They also encourage infants to self-feed, put on shoes, wash hands etc at the age-appropriate juncture. My young one is currently doing very well in the care of these experienced, qualified and most importantly, loving teachers. Toddlerhood was a tough phase for my elder son who was having difficulty coping with his big emotions. I am grateful to Teacher Joyce for going the extra mile, to sit with him every evening before pick up to walk him through and sort out these feelings. The teacher-child bond is so strong, my child would even mistakenly call me Teacher Joyce at times! He would also always say he misses her. Dealing with a threenager is difficult. Dealing with a whole class of them calls for utmost patience and dedication, kudos to Teacher Joyce and Liu Laoshi! It was a drastic change for my elder son to graduate from PG to Nursery this year. Here, independence is strongly encouraged in preparation for Primary school. Children will learn to go to the toilet, clean up after themselves and learn to communicate their wants and needs. They do well in fostering the children's curiosity and also build up my son's confidence for public speaking through ""Show and Tell"". Many thanks to Teacher Joycelyn and Lei Laoshi for the well structured, creative and enjoyable lessons. My elder child especially loves the lesson on the 3R's and also listening walk, and would request to do the same at home. Through their patient guidance, we can see improvement in our child's speech and confidence. Beyond the day to day classroom curriculum, the centre also offers optional age-appropriate music/ abacus/ science etc enrichment lessons in the evening. This is helpful for parents with time constraints for weekend enrichment classes. MFS-RVC is not just a school, in a way, it's like an extended family. The Principal and teachers are extremely supportive, always willing to share good advice when needed. When we were having a hard time deciding the next path for our child, Ms Angela generously spent an hour out of her busy schedule to speak to us, providing us with her unbiased, useful advice. Our children spend most of their time in school and finding them the right one is paramount.

The teachers will also give me advise on how to help him or what i should do in his process of growing up . even though this is my second child but its the first time im actually taking care of one without any help and the teacher's advises came in time like a helping for me in his upgrowing . they also will update me on everything that has happen in school when i go fetch him and all . im glad my son eventually likes to go to school a lot he will wake up very early and be excited when i tell him that its time for him to go school . he is learning a lot also especially when i have to work a lot but the teachers will help him in talking , in walking and also some hands on also as it was in the portal for parents on the child's activities and all . im able to work in peace knowing that my child is in good hands :) thank you so much for all the time and kindness taken in helping my child to grow i really am grateful for all the help :)",0.21160685805422647,2,"['help', 'time', 'teacher', 'school', 'child', 'lot', 'take', 'like', 'advise', 'come', 'son', 'actually', 'hand', 'work', 'hard', 'grow', 'excite', 'able', 'upgrowing', 'activity']",My First Skool at Blk 153 Rivervale Crescent

"A mega childcare centre with warm, dedicated and patient principal, teachers and support staffs. Each of them played a critical role in helping our children to adjust, adapt and enjoy their preschool experiences. It is highly commendable as the staffs will consistently make conscientious effort to identify and memorise the name of every child at the centre. Activities and celebrations are also frequently held for the children to help them to understand the origins of each festivals and foster a senses of what they should value in their lives. The publications of the activities album are helpful for parents to know and understand the learning phase of their children as well. The location, standalone building as well as the comprehensive range of facilities available have also enabled the children to learn, play and grow uninterrupted. Hope to see the organising of external excursions (e.g. to the farms, etc) for the children/and parents to mingle and share their experiences of parenting. A forum/portal for the parents to interact with one another will be beneficial for the growth of the children as well.

"This childcare centre by MFS is a hidden gem. My elder boy entered the centre halfway in K1 (in 2019) and the teachers (Luo Laoshi & Teacher Ram) did a great job to assimilate him and encouraged the other children to engage him. For a boy who cried daily at drop off in his previous school, we were prepared that he'll cry again, but to our surprise, he didn't cry at all during this transition and thereafter, enjoyed going to sch daily until he graduated last year. My younger child now has the same privilege to be cared for by the same team of dedicated teachers (Luo Laoshi, Teacher Ram & Teacher Kavitha). Curriculum wise, I had my concerns initially like most parents - shd I pay more for better academic focus? That's always the scale that most parents would weigh, but my concerns were allayed as I've come to realize that MFS is a good balance of both affordability and quality. My elder boy enjoyed learning through the various inquiry projects - there would be different themes each term and the teachers put in a lot of effort to pique children's curiosity via hands-on activity, parent engagement, relation to current affairs and relevance to primary school. The teachers also took many pictures of my child in action and I can easily view the pictures weekly in the parents portal to see what they've learned in school. My boy excelled under this system and is now doing well in primary school with strong foundation set during the 2 yrs of his time in MFS. Apart from its team of caring and competent teachers, the centre's layout is also a plus point. The classes are split into 3 different bays around blk 258/260, so cases of hfmd, and even covid were kept to a minimal. Many parents who sent their children to this centre also echo my same view and thus I'd not hesitate to recommend this centre to my family, neighbours and friends.",0.23259803921568634,4,"['teacher', 'parent', 'centre', 'child', 'school', 'boy', 'mfs', 'cry', 'concern', 'primary', 'laoshi', 'view', 'luo', 'ram', 'eld', 'learn', 'picture', 'different', 'team', 'daily']",My First Skool (260 Bukit Batok East Ave 4)

"""We have been blessed to have fantastic teachers for both our kids in Mulberry Tanjong Pagar branch. As other reviews can attest for quality, I shall highlight other aspects of the school/centre. The school operates very much like a family-centric centre; by that, I mean how closely-knitted the staff and teachers are both as professional and friends; This is an important aspect that most people don't pay attention to. A vibrant, positive, happy work place will influence how the children in-turn get influenced on their daily-interaction and learning journey. The children formed very strong bonds with their teachers, through the similar staff-to-staff positive relationship they have fostered over the years. The bonds from teachers-and-children, are one of many layers: bonds of respect and authority (as caregivers, educators) to bonds of friendship (where the children see their teachers as their best friend and someone they can safely confide in during the school hours). We have been to a few different pre-schools across our 2 children's early-childhood years; and I can say that a school/centre that doesn't have the above as a strong bond, operates very loosely as a school that functions as ""just a salaried employee"". Tanjong Pagar Mulberry's teachers are always a mile or two beyond what they are required to do. During some of the parent-volunteer work, I have personally witnessed how the teachers manage the kids, how the kids look-up to their teachers from celebrating moments of happiness, to confiding in sadness shows a lot about their bonds forged.

"Only if I can give negative stars. We registered our child into this NEWLY opened IFC at tanjong pagar (yes due to location, the fees are not cheap at all). My child was the pioneer batch and there were only 3 infants to start with. So our story with mulberry IFC goes... My child was admitted to hospital after her first week in a newly opened IFC, being diagnosed with herpangina. My child just turned 4mo. On top of the every-other-monthly sickness of cough and flu, my child had stomach flu at least 3 times in between. With the persistent watery stool, it caused her skin to break down. My child was experiencing intense pain and requires saline wash, because the broken skin just can't tolerate tap water and cotton balls. Ultimately requiring antibiotics (oral and topical for the bum). We gave instructions very clearly and even taught the main educarer multiple times on the application of diaper cream. Somehow redness can still develop over her private part all the way to her bum. Every weekend I have to nurse her skin back to normal. And yes, they significantly improved with the diaper cream. After giving them a clean healthy bum skin for the week, I receive red skin for the weekends again. 7 months into ifc, my child had another episode of herpangina. And it has to fall on her 1st birthday party. All in all, throughout her attendance from Sep 2022 - Jul 2023, a total of 11 months, my child had a total of 2 herpanginia episodes. The 2nd one was an outbreak and the school was asked to close by MOH (yes it was THAT serious). This shows enough right? The last straw was the principal, Ms Lee. I'd describe her as inexperience with poor insight and management. Though she's polite and trying to portray a professional front, but you can feel that it's all fake. We requested for a spot at PG when we entered our child into IFC. We were also promised that we will be given priority, just need to remind them again when my child turns 15mo. That's when the school will prepare the child for transition. At 13mo, we went to have a chat with Ms Lee, asking more about PG classes, the fees and subsidy etc. It was an incidental finding... As we were then told that there's no space for my child, and this will be it even till the following year. The principle put the blame on us saying that it is our duty to let them know if we wanted a spot (didn't we before we confirm our child into your IFC? We even have prove of the conversation.) So much for giving my child priority. And even when the spots are filling up before she turns 15mo, the school did not ask if we would like to reserve a space. And to shock us further, some students who entered IFC after my child, had gotten themselves a spot at PG. The principle claimed that the parents went to her to request for it. So my question was how do they know to approach the school and reserve a PG spot even before their own child turns 15mo (if that's the rule set by the school)? The whole conversation with Ms Lee, there were no apology, no sense of remorse, whatsoever. All she said was 'there's definitely lapses', 'we will do better', 'we will improve'. To think about it, if we didn't look her up wanting to know more about PG curriculum and fees etc, we probably wouldn't know there's no spot up till my child really turns 18mo. We have to go through the whole process of finding a preschool for our child, shortlisting them, taking out time from work to attend school tours. This has caused soooooooo much inconvenience at our end, just because of their terribly poor management. Think again before you send ur child to this one here.",0.06839345839345841,4,"['child', 'ifc', 'school', 'spot', 'turn', 'skin', 'pg', 'know', 'give', 'go', 'ask', 'time', 'lee', 'ms', 'bum', 'fee', 'yes', 'principle', 'enter', 'week']",Mulberry Learning Centre @ Tanjong Pagar Pte Ltd

I am very grateful to Mindchamps for accompanying my children, and I am also grateful to myself for making the most suitable choice for my children at the right time. The school has a strong teaching system and teachers have great teaching ambitions. They spend every bit of time to give the children the best possible enlightenment, from imparting knowledge and culture to taking care of them between meals and classes. They lead by example and strive for excellence. The results of their words and deeds can be clearly seen in the lives of the children. For us, what is particularly worth mentioning is the progress of the children‚Äôs Chinese language. I believe that many Chinese families have similar troubles, and there are certain deficiencies in the Chinese language in an English-speaking environment. Listening, speaking, reading and writing are a very important language development period between the ages of 3 and 6. For children whose native language is English, learning another cumbersome language seems very difficult.

"I am so glad that I placed my kid into this center. I feel assured that he is safe and will be well taken care of when he is in school. I can literally feel the stress off my mind when I drop him off everyday. Joyce, the director and Mee Lin, the principal, are both exceptional in their duties. The fact that they make the effort to remember the names of all the children and their respective classes goes to show that they care and take their role seriously. The staff from reception to cleaning, are dedicated individuals who enjoy their work. In this time and age, it is hard to come by professionals who work hard, with heart. Children there are happy and enjoy a sense of community. My kid was always happy and he ate well, and learnt different types of food. He was also exposed to a myriad of world knowledge at a very young age which helped him converse with adults with confidence. If you are looking for a preschool for your little one, I will recommend you visit this center before you decide. I hope the staff stays on and the center continue to thrive.",0.14402777777777778,0,"['center', 'work', 'enjoy', 'staff', 'kid', 'hard', 'child', 'age', 'happy', 'care', 'feel', 'dedicate', 'assure', 'seriously', 'young', 'adult', 'confidence', 'director', 'drop', 'professional']",MindChamps Chinese PreSchool @ Tampines Central
"When Shan turned 18 months old, we enrolled him in the MindChamps Chinese Pre-school. Since then, everything has continued to impress us, from the top hygiene standards, to the user-friendly school application, the comprehensive curriculum, the nourishing lunch and dessert menus, the colourful activities throughout the year, and most importantly, being surrounded by teachers and staff who truly care and love the children. We have been delighted to witness the tremendous growth our son has made since entering school as he has become more independent and outgoing than ever before. Every week he surprises us with new skills and developments he has acquired in school, and he never stops giggling when we mention his teachers‚Äô names.

"After visiting many pre schools, we enrolled our daughter at Mindchamps Chinese@ Tampines at the age of 3, concerned about how she'll fit into school life having been at home for 2 years. It turned out way better than we expected; she enjoys school, her Mandarin has improved tremendously, and she has grown in her learning, her independence and her thinking. She is able to converse eloquently in Chinese, and comes back singing Chinese songs, where previous attempts to coach her in Mandarin at home failed. She has become more independent in her daily activities, and is learning how to interact with friends. In addition, the wonderful teachers and administrator at the school always gave us security in their care and updates on weekly activities and learning. We loved that there was no rote learning, instead learning was made fun and enjoyable for the children. It was the best decision we made that gave her an excellent headstart and look forward to sending our second child there.",0.2939393939393939,0,"['school', 'learn', 'chinese', 'activity', 'child', 'learning', 'give', 'mandarin', 'home', 'daughter', 'visit', 'addition', 'able', 'eloquently', 'enjoy', 'come', 'excellent', 'send', 'expect', 'way']",MindChamps Chinese PreSchool @ Tampines Central

My husband and i love the operating systems of the whole centre and communications is very up close with parents. My daughter chat with me about how Ms Mei Lin (Principal) sit down with them to have lunch and tries to understand more about them and how patient her class teachers (Teacher Michelle and Ms Cong) is. Till date, my daughter actually forbids me to pick her up anything earlier than 630pm because she enjoys spending time in school and with her friends.

"Our daughter started attending MindChamps Chinese Preschool @ Tampines Central when she was 20 months old. We were rather concerned about sending her to school at a young age because she was not eating and sleeping well. In addition, the first few months were very difficult as she cried terribly every morning, both at home and at drop off. We are very thankful that everyone in the school, especially Joyce, Ms Mee Lin, ÁéãËÄÅÂ∏à, Âë®ËÄÅÂ∏à, teacher Priscilla and teacher Jaymee, helped her to adapt and settle into the new environment and routine. She learned to feed herself, fall asleep on her own without pacifier and started eating and drinking very well in school within a few weeks. We are very grateful to Joyce and the teachers who send us regular updates about how well she is eating and enjoying herself in class, even after she has settled down well in school. Joyce and the teachers are also always very patient and helpful when we have questions about school. We were surprised when the teachers and staff who do not teach our daughter are able to identify her by her name. It is very heart warming to know that every teacher and staff in school makes an effort to know every child. Thank you for being so attentive and loving towards all the children. Our daughter has been attending school for a year now. She is conversing comfortably in both English and Mandarin and we often hear her speaking Mandarin when she is playing by herself.

Now noting that it is also healthy and fundamentally good for kids to start from young to be bilingual or more, my concern is resolved when Teacher Darlene and Michelle noticed that and started to guide my daughter towards conversing in English as well.

"Having been in a total English-speaking environment for first 4.5 years of their lives, my twins hardly knew any Chinese when they first started K1 at MindChamps Chinese Preschool, Tampines. At the beginning, it was difficult as the environment, the routine and the language were completely new to them. However, thanks to the teachers who have been very patient and encouraging, they both settled in quickly. They also showed great improvement in understanding, speaking and writing Chinese after just a few months. I like that the learning themes are the same for both English and Chinese lessons so they get to learn about a topic in two different languages. Rather than overlapping, the English and Chinese lessons actually complement each other. That is a brilliant way for children to pick up words in the language they are weaker in. My twins are now more confident about Chinese, in fact, they have started to speak the language voluntarily and often share with me enthusiastically the new words they learnt. We can tell from the lesson contents and teaching materials that the teachers put in a lot of effort to engage the children. Together with the support staff, they set a cheerful, positive ambience where children can grow and develop to their full potential without fear. After all, children should feel joy in learning.

"My elder girl started school at Mindchamps Chinese Preschool @ Tampines Central as a N1 Champ and is now into her 4th year in K2. Our precious little girl will be graduating very soon, which is such a poignant moment. She has grown up so much over the last 4 years! From a shy little girl who cannot even go up and down the steps properly to now where she can speak confidently and has her own mind; overcoming her fear of slides; and even taking great care of her little sister who is now in the N1 class, she has blossomed into a young little lady. Her change has been amazing. We recall the days when she could not even hold her scissors and pencil properly and now she could write both English and Chinese words beautifully (when she puts her mind to it!). One of her biggest improvement is in the Chinese language. She has always been and still is an ‚ÄúEnglish speaking‚Äù girl and not a big fan of Chinese. At one point, her grandparents were concerned that she does not seem to understand Chinese, but now, she can reply in simple Mandarin. We were all impressed that she could recite ‚ÄúËØóËØç‚Äù and sing some Chinese songs. Her Chinese writing also improved a lot and when I see her master the Chinese spelling every week now, I am really grateful to all her teachers. We can see her improve bit by bit and I am sure this is due to the foundation laid over the years. Her sister is in N1 now, and has already spent about 2 years in the school. Her development is also amazing. In the early days, she would cry every day when we send her to school but now she loves all her teachers and friends. She even tell me she has ""babies"" in school (i.e. newbies in her class) and she is a ""big girl"" now. Initially she is also reluctant to speak Mandarin but now I hear she can converse well in Mandarin. She has also grown more independent now and really loves performing. Both of them have very positive experience and development in the school and we never regretted our decision to enrol them in MindChamps Chinese Preschool @ Tampines Central. Although there were several changes of teachers through the years, they always love their teachers. Thanks to all the teachers and staff of the school for giving the girls such a wonderful foundation for life.",0.15028111301696212,5,"['chinese', 'girl', 'school', 'teacher', 'year', 'little', 'big', 'mandarin', 'love', 'day', 'change', 'foundation', 'english', 'class', 'central', 'grow', 'preschool', 'properly', 'bit', 'tampines']",MindChamps Chinese PreSchool @ Tampines Central

"Since enrolling in Mindchamp Chinese Kindergarten in July 2020, I have received a good education in both Chinese and English. We are very grateful to Teacher Liu, Teacher Huang, Teacher Ping, Teacher Darlene and Teacher Jaymee for their careful teaching, which has enabled the children to make great progress in many aspects. We have found that teachers are effective in motivating children to learn. For example, she often takes out a pen and paper after coming home from school and practices writing the letters and numbers she learned in school. It can be seen that she is very interested in what the teachers have taught her. I am very grateful to the teachers for taking the time to regularly organize and send the content they have learned to parents, so that we can consolidate and strengthen the knowledge we have learned at home in a timely manner. In addition, teachers are also very interactive with children during the teaching process. For example, when learning about insects, children are very interested in the transformation process of caterpillars, and their related Chinese and English vocabulary has also increased a lot. We also started trying to feed the caterpillars at home. The first thing we did after returning home every day was to visit and observe them. We were very interested. Our parents and children learned and gained a lot of knowledge about feeding caterpillars together in this process. At the same time, I am very grateful to the teachers for their patience and timely guidance. During the past year or so of learning at Mindchamp, we have seen significant progress in our children. Under the guidance of teachers, children have developed a strong interest not only in Chinese and English, but also in nature and science. At the same time, her personality gradually became lively and cheerful, she made many good friends in the class, and she also enjoyed sharing the handicrafts she made at home with her teachers. Seeing the progress of our children in school, we also enrolled my sister in Doudou Class half a year ago, so that she can learn and grow happily with her sister every day.",0.22369528619528622,4,"['teacher', 'child', 'learn', 'home', 'chinese', 'school', 'time', 'interested', 'process', 'see', 'caterpillar', 'english', 'grateful', 'progress', 'timely', 'day', 'example', 'feed', 'take', 'mindchamp']",MindChamps Chinese PreSchool @ Tampines Central

"""I am writing to lodge an official complaint against M.Y WORLD @ Canberra Eastlink for negligence and unacceptable behaviour from the Playgroup teachers as well as Principal. My granddaughter was enrolled into the Centre for PlayGroup on 1 February 2024 & she is on a 2-week trial period. As she was transferred from a former childcare centre where she had spent more than 13 months, we understood there is a period of adjusting & transition. Unfortunately we feel that the teachers‚Äô support for transition at M.Y WORLD was far below parental expectations, to a certain extent, lack of empathy. During week of 5 Feb, which happened to be the 1st week after orientation, we encountered a few unsatisfactory incidents. (1) the Centre called to say that my grandchild was crying uncontrollably & she was disturbing the rest of children during nap time, the Centre requires the caregiver or parent to bring the child home. My question : should the teacher(s) not try to pacify the crying child while she is still adjusting to the transition? What happens if the toddlers of the entire Playgroup class cried - does it mean the Playgroup has to stop operations & send all the crying toddlers home? (2) on 6 Feb, when my grandchild returned from school, our helper noticed bad rashes from the child‚Äôs belly to pubic area. We tried to contact the teachers to enquire however generic responses were provided, trying to shy away from responsibility. There was no evident efforts to investigate into what happened at all. (3) on 8 Feb, we received a notice from the centre that there was a bruise on the child‚Äôs face. There was no bruises on the evening of 7 Feb till the time when our helper sent the child to the Centre on 8 Feb morning. From the photo provided, it was suspected that the child could have hit a fixture. (4) in one of the telecommunications with the Principal - Ms Puva, she shouted over the telephone to my daughter (parent of my granddaughter) - ""your husband wants to write in to ecda? SURE! by all means go ahead! if your child is not suitable for this centre you can always feel free to source elsewhere"". She also informed email responses take 3 working days (despite there are 2 admin staff and 2 Vice Principals) because she is not at her desk every minute. M.Y WORLD at Canberra Eastlink was referred to us with positive feedback; unfortunately the reality turned out to be a horrifying experience for our family and my granddaughter. She used to be a happy kid going to school but she became an unhappy child when she arrived at the gate of the centre. I am extremely disappointed with the experience & service quality of the teachers, including the Principal. I have no confidence that M.Y WORLD could deliver its mission in the childcare & education industry. The negligence is unacceptable and intolerable. It was a nightmare enrolling my granddaughter into M.Y WORLD. We have since withdrawn my granddaughter from the centre, as advised by the Principal during her tele-conversation with my daughter, to prevent any further hurt and victimization.""",-0.12550660546350198,3,"['child', 'centre', 'world', 'feb', 'granddaughter', 'principal', 'playgroup', 'teacher', 'cry', 'happen', 'week', 'try', 'transition', 'eastlink', 'canberra', 'school', 'response', 'time', 'negligence', 'unacceptable']",M.Y World @ Canberra Eastlink

"""Personally, the litmus test on whether young kids should attend a school is whether they love or hate attending school. I have a 3 year old who started at this school since Nov 2021, and recently a 18 month old who started in Jun 2023. So far they have very happy demeanor every morning when I send them to school. The interaction between my kids and the teachers & non-teaching staff at school is also very positive. Earlier when I assessed the school environment, I like that because it is contained within Queenstown Lutheran Church, there is normally less strangers passing by on weekdays. Each class also has its own physical classroom - which was important for me esp it was during COVID times when I registered my 1st child. There's a small garden, swing, playground, scooter and tricycles all within the church premises that the kids can use. They also take the opportunity to teach the kids about nature and care for the plants in the garden. Course content also has a lot of creative learning. Every term the kids have 1 field trip to learn about the real world outside school. For all key festivals and holidays the kids are educated about the significance of the event and encouraged to create an art n craft piece to take home. The real bonus for us is that my elder kid has finally learnt to eat vegetables through the daily encouragement at school. Also independently brings the used utensils to the kitchen sink, then wipes away the food debris.

After much consideration, I relocated her to LSS with faith that a catholic preschool will help. Within 2 months...I realised significant positive change - N2 under the leadership of teacher Karen.

"We are very glad that our child can study in Little Shepherds' Schoolhouse Church of St Francis of Assisi, a loving family. The LSS open outdoor activity setting has not only but not limit to trees, grasses, flowers, sand pool, soil slope and swings, which allow children to learn and play happily in a green environment close to nature. The vegetable garden in the backyard gives children the opportunity to experience the fun of planting and watering vegetables. Meanwhile, children enjoy the joy of harvesting in the process of caring for plants themselves, and naturally learn the value of life, thereby respecting life. The open classroom is arranged with various learning corners - reading, painting, music, handicrafts, experiments, and learning aids are put in an orderly manner. Children‚Äôs handicrafts created with environmentally friendly materials are displayed in the classroom from time to time, which cultivate children's awareness and ability to discover, observe and appreciate beautiful things imperceptibly. We sincerely thank the teachers of LSS for their efforts to organise various thematic activities periodically. Different thematic activities inspire children to understand the diversity of culture, different human customs, and create artworks full of creativity and imagination. Various thematic activities are also a bridge connecting schools, parents and communities, making the connection between parents and children, parents and teachers closer. Therefore, every parent has witnessed the growth of their children in LSS and the development and growth of LSS. Finally, we would like to thank our child's teacher, Mrs. Dcruz and He Lao Shi. The two teachers not only guide for children to learn book knowledge, but also practitioners who love life and nature. Mrs. Dcruz led the children to observe the mother of birds nesting under the eaves outside the classroom to apply eggs. He Lao Shi brought the baby chicken from home every Monday to let the children observe the growth of the baby chicken. In this process, children experienced the joy of vigourous growth of life and the sadness of losing vitality. We think this is a very meaningful life education. Last but not least, thanks to the leaders and teachers of LSS for their hard work.""",0.16610360360360363,5,"['child', 'learn', 'teacher', 'life', 'lss', 'activity', 'parent', 'growth', 'observe', 'thematic', 'thank', 'classroom', 'create', 'nature', 'vegetable', 'handicraft', 'love', 'shi', 'different', 'baby']",Little Shepherds√É¬Ç√Ç¬í Schoolhouse@Church of St Francis of Assisi-JW

"I sent my two children to Little Seeds Preschool soon after both turned 20 months old.

There were few minor incidents happened to my kids and they called me immediately to informed and clarified the issues with me. Principle and Admin Executives are very responsive and react fast to parent‚Äôs requests/enquiries. Thumbs up to the lovely Aunties who are preparing foods for the children, they are so in love with the children until my kids demanded me to buy presents to them in all occasions. Can you imagine what environment that the children are living in? On the other hands, some of the things need to be improved like the hygiene of the floor and environmental care like mosquitoes/insect‚Äôs issue bite. Both of my kids used to have mosquito‚Äôs bites but soon after I addressed the issue, the school responded fast and able to provide better environment for the children. Well done! In term of the school curriculum, the school adopted learn through play, outdoor learning and exploration, key to learning, project-based learning, visual arts, current affairs, art & craft, story time and many more. These make it so fun for the children and two of my kids love going to school. My kids are not just learning how to read and write in the school like most preschools are emphasizing. I don‚Äôt have to send them to enrichment classes and hence I spend more time with them on weekend. Due to Covid-19, outdoor activities are being suspended and kids are feeling sad. Besides that, I love the idea of celebration of events like CNY, Hari Raya, Deepavali, National Day, Teachers Day, Children Day, Harmony Day, Mid- Autumn festival and school projects like our dreams for Singapore. Fantastic! In term of my children, they both are doing well so far. We are the parents of emphasizing in characters building at these ages. They both have good EQ and showing good moral values like loving, respecting the senior, kind, showing empathy, communicating well with people, have good cognitive abilities. But my older one need more affords in anger management. Both showing good social responsibilities like they will complain to me that people shouldn‚Äôt throw rubbish on the floor and must keep our Singapore clean!

I believe we are not the only parents who have encountered this based on other reviews. (The Teachers in the infant-care are a good dedicated bunch, I would not say the same about the covering Teachers as sometimes when I collect my child, they have a strong sweat stench, which I noticed came from the covering teachers, which is unhygienic. Facility wise and general updating is good. School increased the cost until it became ridiculously expensive. The management of the school seems to not be able to empathise certain issues, just a standard reply every time you question things regarding the school. No mediation of the problem. I took my child out after 5 months there and found a better school which charge half the price. Another issue is they kept on closing and sending kids back for the smallest issue. During covid, they would close so frequent because they had to clean the place up.

As we bid farewell to this wonderful child care center, we want to extend our heartfelt appreciation to two remarkable individuals who have made a lasting impact on our child's development and well-being: Teacher Yang and Teacher Siti, particularly in Giselle's Chinese class. From the moment Giselle stepped into the doors of Little Green House @ Yishun at just one and a half years old, we knew we had made the right choice for her early childhood education. The warm and nurturing atmosphere at the center, coupled with the dedication and expertise of the staff, has made it a second home for our little one. Teacher Yang's commitment to Giselle's Chinese language development has been truly exceptional. She possesses the rare gift of making learning both fun and educational, inspiring a genuine love for the language in our child. Under Teacher Yang's guidance, Giselle has blossomed into a confident and expressive little communicator. We are incredibly grateful for the patience and encouragement Teacher Yang has shown Giselle over the years, nurturing her love for the Chinese language. Teacher Siti, on the other hand, has been a constant source of comfort and support for Giselle throughout her journey at Little Green House. Her caring and compassionate approach has ensured that Giselle always felt safe and cherished, allowing her to develop not only academically but also emotionally. Her kindness and dedication have provided Giselle with a solid foundation upon which to build her future learning experiences. It is with heavy hearts that we say goodbye to Little Green House @ Yishun, but we do so with the knowledge that Giselle is well-prepared for her next educational adventure.

Each of the teachers are dedicated to the students, not forgetting the warm and love tendered to the kids and myself especially appreciate the constant feedback shared between the parents and teachers so that we are always aware on the kids learning and behavior and together both parents and teachers will surveillance to tackle any issues. For the past 5 years the kids has made many wonderful friends, it‚Äôs such a sweet feeling as we literally watch these kids grow. Also, great friendship were forged with the teachers - a special shout out to Tr D, MuMu Laoshi for their dedication to the K2 class especially to Tr D. Not only on curriculum, she take times and effort to cultivate kids interest on other activities eg art and craft. My kids like pokemon, sometimes during free time she will draw with them. There was once my son brought back a pikachu drawing and it was drew by her. We did not know there is this artistic side of her! haha. And personally on top of being a form teacher, I feel her warm yet strict calibre makes her an excellent discipline mistress too! The kids loves her to bits.

"""All my 3 kids went to/ currently in Little Footprints 168D Punggol. When my firstborn started in year end of 2015 in PG, it was honestly just another childcare to us. It was only in 2016 when the new principal came on board that we saw what a difference the leader makes. With the now-ex principal, she took many initiatives, all for the well-being of not only the kids, but for the young parents like us as well. She constantly kept us updated of our kids' progress over whatsapp. Its truly a blessing to be able to receive pictures of the little ones periodically as they learn in school, many milestones which we, working parents, will miss due to us working. The reminders over WhatsApp on happenings in school, such as festive celebrations, fees deadlines etc were also welcoming as there are many of us who are really not as responsive on emails/ app platforms. The environment in school was a welcoming one, with a sense of belonging for children. I knew the teachers well - you can sense they genuinely love the children and this the children reciprocate it back in return. My wife and I gave raving reviews about this school whenever the topic of childcare came up. The principal and her team were invested in the well being and growth of the children, not only academically. There were so many excursions, parent-child bonding activities etc planned that we were a part of. And also allowed for parents to know each other, forming an informal parent support group ourselves. However, all this ended in July 2022 when the principal left, and there was such a high turnover of teachers. Half or more of my youngest child's class had left due to the instability of the centre. Communication with the school now becomes generic. Only via the official platform, where children's updates are now slow/ non existent. Previously, height/weight is periodically recorded. Now, the last update was half a year ago. I dropped off my kids and see now the school is no longer as inviting as before. There is hardly any artwork of kids decorating the school premises, no more birthday babies' of the month pictures greeting you at the entrance etc. The centre has now become jus another business, where everything is transactional and reactive. Complaints get replied to with generic responses. An educator is more than just a business. I hope the management can relook into your processes. You once had a great team, there is a big shoe to fill. At least be open to feedback from parents - not jus dealing blindly with the feedback from parents and refusing to acknowledge it. I am sure statistics don't lie, look at your student withdrawals turnover rate of staff, they should tell you alot.",0.08582611832611835,1,"['school', 'parent', 'child', 'kid', 'principal', 'update', 'etc', 'turnover', 'childcare', 'periodically', 'teacher', 'young', 'whatsapp', 'end', 'year', 'picture', 'jus', 'team', 'generic', 'half']",Little Footprints Preschool Pte Ltd (Punggol 168)

Deep apologies, but appreciate that she used to clean her , make her sit on her lap again and sing nursery rhymes with her to constantly engage her. Ms Buwana made sure ayesha ate well in school. Updated me daily about her eating improvements and sleeping pattern in school which surely made me feel more secure and confident with her being in school. Ms Daya gave the warmth and love of a mother. Ayesha cries whenevr i drop her to school, she made sure to give ayesha hug for atleast 5 mins to calm her down. Ayesha hugs her back so tight like she hugs me. She got magical hugs which really soothed ayesha.

"Heartfelt Thanks for Exceptional Care and Education by Little Footprints Preschool (Blk 248 Jurong East) Dear Ms Susan and HQ Little Footprints, I am writing to express my deepest gratitude to Principal, Ms Susan and her dedicated team of teachers & staff especially Ms Jude and Zhang ËÄÅÂ∏à at Little Footprints Preschool for the outstanding care and education provided to my daughter, En Qi. I am truly impressed by the thoughtful curriculum planning and the immense effort that goes into creating a nurturing environment for the children. It is evident that the passion for education and genuine care for each child's well-being are at the core of Little Footprints. I recalled in one of the instances which was the Mid Autumn Festival 2023, I was truly impressed with the immense effort and care displayed by Ms Susan and her team of teachers & staff to dress up as Chang Er and Hou Yi to perform for the kids. This will help them understand the festival origins and why we need to celebrate the festival which is very important. They have also planned games and songs for us as parents to interact with the kids. I recalled this occasion fondly because I remembered that day was the hottest day in the month which temperatures soar to 36/37 degrees celsius. Despite that, they did not show any unhappiness but instead putting on their sweetest smiles and effort to guide and celebrate with the students on the festivities despite wearing thick costumes and head gear. Apart from the above, my daughter, En Qi has not only thrived academically but has also developed valuable social and emotional skills under the guidance of your exceptional team. Your commitment to fostering a positive and stimulating learning environment has made a lasting impact on her, and we are grateful for the positive experiences she has gained. Please extend our appreciation to Principal, Ms Susan and her team of teachers & staff especially Ms Jude and Zhang ËÄÅÂ∏à whom have played a crucial role in her growth and development. Their dedication and enthusiasm do not go unnoticed, and we are fortunate to have such a remarkable team shaping the foundation of our child's early education. Once again, thank you to Ms Susan, her team of teachers and staff in Little Footprints Preschool (Blk 248 Jurong East) for your unwavering commitment to providing a high-quality education and a caring atmosphere. We feel fortunate to be part of the Little Footprints Preschool community. If possible, please do reward them so that they will be motivated to stay longer in this school as such early childhood educators are very hard to come by these days.

The teachers were nurturing and patient to guide her into the school routine. Even though she still cries at check in today, she has improved tremendously for this separation anxiety issue, and would even tell me she did not cry sometimes. She also started off as a sole mandarin speaker during PG times and kudos to Mdm Maimon's guidance and patience, she could understand English instructions now. After the transition to PN, she can speak simple english now, thanks to Ms Kar Yin's patience in teaching her.

"My elder daughter first started preschool at LFP in July 2020 (was called Bright Juniors back then). She managed to settle down in school within two weeks, which is not surprising given that her then-PG teachers had such a vibrant and outgoing personality! Also, I could see my girl‚Äôs transformation when she started verbalizing her thoughts just a few weeks into school! Before school, she only could say simple words. I was also impressed with the thoughtfulness of the school in several levels: 1. In helping the children transit from PG/PN class to Nursery, there was an intimate handover, and tailored plan to help the children adapt to a relatively more ‚Äúacademic‚Äù focused curriculum, with writing classes, potty training etc. 2. The teachers are also very meticulous in caring for the children, for example they shared tips with me on how to help my daughter overcome the fear of showering her hair when they noticed such an issue. Even the non-teaching staff has much love for the kids. The aunty (responsible for cooking the meals and cleaning) also showed concern on my girl‚Äôs eczema condition and expressed her heartache when she saw the wounds while bathing her. I really appreciate the love showered on my kids. 3. The teachers put in a lot of effort in decorating the school, and dressing themselves and the children up, during festive seasons or special celebrations. During the recent reading week, my daughter‚Äôs teacher dressed as tinker bell, Jasmine (from Aladdin), red riding hood, Snow White, etc (just to name a few) to engage the children. This made school so fun and enjoyable, and my daughter came home sharing how she wanted to be a princess too! 4. The vitamin C lessons taught my children to be a better person than they could be. My elder daughter was facing difficulties coping with the birth of her baby brother. The teachers helped to guide her in celebrating her new brother‚Äôs presence! Recently, the kids also displayed motivation in ‚Äúbeing helpful‚Äù at home from these lessons. Hence, when it‚Äôs time for my younger son to start school this year, I immediately enrolled him to LFP!

"Mdm Zahara (Principal) First please allow me to say ""Thank You"" to the Principal and her team of dedicated teachers of Little Footprints Preschool (Yishun 71A). At the time of registration my 2 little girls, Veronica Shalini (4 yrs old) and Nageshwary (3 yrs old) were very fearful of their surrounding and shy to look up at strangers. Mdm Zahara gave us the assurance that she and her teachers will work hard to help these kids grow up with confidence and be knowledgeable.  She is always with a smiling face and shows that she is willing to listen to our concerns and give a helping hand. Now the 2 kids are in the 3 rd Term, and I can see improvement in their confidence level. This is itself a great achievement to the school and the teachers. PLEASE KEEP UP THE GOOD WORK Weili Luo (Teacher) She is a Chinese Language Teacher and trying her level best to teach my 2 Kids the language. I feel that she has somehow succeeded in her effort because sometimes the kids prompt a few words in the language. I think she is doing a great job and I must thank her foe her effort. The 2 kids have earned her trust and the school environment and are always willing to go to school. Normah Junid (Teacher) Veronica Shalini was having speech problem and her words are not clear. She is also the shy type. With Mdm Normah's willingness to teach and her positive approach has helped this child to come out from the shell. She can now speak in sentences and her Gross Motor Skills and Fine Motor Skills has improved quite a bit. The 2 kids have earned her trust and the school environment and are always willing to go to school.

"I have enrolled my daughter to start the school in January next year and had to withdraw her with 1 month notice given due to personal reason. The Principal, Ms Jenny, demanded that I have to let go both registration fee and 50% of the school fee which was not what she said on the phone when we communicated. She only mentioned about the registration fee being forfeited. No form or details were emailed to me but only the details of the UEN number and subsidies form to get the procedures going. She was not only unhelpful but rude at the same time. Prior to me enrolling into the school, I went down for a school tour which she said she will be the one doing but I was given a tour by a teacher who is leaving the school hence no information about enrolment was given as well. I find it ridiculous that I have to pay 50% of the school fee when my child haven't even started school and I gave 1 and a half month notice before withdrawing my enrolment.

"It was by leap of faith that my girl was enrolled in Little Footprints (Jurong West 660 branch). We were searching around our vicinity for a childcare centre when I (Mummy) came across this cute-looking uniform that LFP has. I contacted Ms Ang (The principal) and arranged for a visit to the centre and the rest is history. My girl started her Pre-nursery life with the centre from year 2021, when she was 2.5 years old. The principal and teachers took great effort and patience to help her adapt to school, keeping us updated constantly for the 1st few weeks as she settled down. Within the year, we saw how Roanne grew to be more independent (able to take charge of herself e.g. getting dressed, potty-trained) and gained a lot more knowledge. As my girl progressed to Nursery in 2022, we'd see her develop so much more, be it emotionally as she connects better with her classmates (having best friends!) and intellectually (the knowledge just keeps growing!). I specially like the ""Tick tock, Time to talk"" sessions the centre introduced. It helps to build confidence in the children when they speak in front of an audience, which will prove useful as they progressed further in life. One of the many aspects I like about centre is how engaging/attentive the principal and teachers are. We, parents are kept updated with the ongoings in school and our queries are always answered. This is something which we appreciate a lot. All in all, I'm glad the cute-looking uniform brought me to LFP (Jurong West 660).",0.29445436507936507,5,"['centre', 'principal', 'year', 'keep', 'girl', 'lfp', 'nursery', 'uniform', 'knowledge', 'like', 'cute', 'update', 'teacher', 'life', 'progress', 'jurong', 'school', 'lot', 'look', 'help']",Little Footprints Preschool (Jurong West 660)

"""My child has been attending this pre-school since she was an infant, and I've witnessed the school's various phases of transformation over the years. It's newly renovated and so is the complex in which it's situated. Facilities are clean, new, and updated. The overall quality of this franchise has improved tremendously since it was bought over by a new operator some years back. What I appreciate: - The school is communicative. The bulk of communication and developmental updates are done through a well-functioning app, which I find more than adequate. They also provide regular developmental and curriculum updates. Inevitable viral outbreaks are well-controlled and well-communicated. Class promotions are well-executed. - The teachers are caring, patient, and chill. I've observed how well the new students adapt; many start initially shy and nervous but develop into confident, happy children. - The school takes a collaborative approach to nurturing the children. We shouldn't be outsourcing our parenting, and I appreciate how this school embraces that. If you're an involved parent and are willing to put in the work, you will find plenty of opportunities to be part of your child's growth. My child is always so happy when I get invited to her school for parties and story-telling. It's worth taking time off work for these occasions. - The curriculum is rich and well-rounded. I have no qualms that my child will be well prepared for the academic rigour of primary school. Heck, she's learning Chinese words that even I can't recognise! She's a confident public speaker due to the myriad of speaking platforms provided by the school. I also like how her Nursery class weaves in current affairs topics, which is awesome in developing societal awareness. - Meals are healthy and nutritious. My child sings praises of Aunty's cooking. She eats stuff that she normally wouldn't eat at home, like brown rice, soft tofu, and seaweed. Oh, the wonders of peer pressure! - The class composition is diverse and inclusive. I love how my child's class is made up of children of different socio-economic and family backgrounds, and with different developmental needs. As a result of her interactions within such a diverse class, my child is growing to be such an adaptable, kind, and empathetic individual. - The kids have scheduled outdoor play time, which is great. A little sun and dirt never hurt any kiddo. I'd appreciate a whole lot more outdoor play time. Room for improvement: - High turnover: My child has witnessed regular teacher resignations throughout her time here. Not sure if it's due to the competitive external environment or lacklustre talent retention strategies within the group. It's a real pity, because most of her teachers are so capable and competent.

"My kids were enrolled between 2 to 3 years here and I was glad to have pulled them out of this incompetent school. The management is always on the defensive side, teachers lack competence in dealing with young children and are quick to put labels on any child that is slower in learning etc. They lack training and the necessary soft skills and posture to handle young children. There were incidents of unacceptable practices as described by my child which were serious enough for us to make a report to ECDA. Shifted my older child to MOE Kindergarten and it has been the best decision we have ever made. My child has undergone a positive transformation away from the negativity of this preschool. Our only regret was not pulling him out sooner. This LFP school was a complete letdown and there is no CCTV installed to verify any of the alleged incidents - which leads me to believe that the staff were probably emboldened by this. The management had also said for more than a year that they were stabilising WIFI infrastructure as an excuse to not install CCTV. I do not trust this school nor the management and would not recommend such a school to any parent. You need to have just one conversation with the principal of this school and this will shed light on the attitude of the management.

The ctr is running at full capacity and at times I'm not sure if the teachers are able to cope or stretching at their max. First - My daughter 's bum constantly red from rash - most likely from delayed diaper change and no, she don't have delicates sensitive skin. Second - she's constantly having runs and I could see intact corns and brown rice in her waste. Ctr continued to feed her such items even after I expressed concern over the suitability as she's only 8 mth old. Even a fellow mummy said the same thing about her infant son, who's also at the Centre. During pick up, at times we will glance at her through the viewing glass. She will be sitting down and stoning. No evening activities or toys to engage her. Alot more issues which I will not go into details.

"""My daughter was transferred from another school to Kidz meadow yew tee a few years ago because at her previous school she was made always sit at a corner because teachers said she's lazy to learn. When she entered kidz meadow yew tee, teacher suggested to bring her for check up and we found out she have dyslexia. Teachers at kidz meadow have very eyes for details. They don't straight away judge your child, they will find root cause and then get it treated from there. She have graduated and in primary 2 now. I have another son who's been with the school since he was 18 months and we all thought he was mute cause he was quiet all the time until he went kidz meadow and start singing nursery rhymes and talk alot. Time flies he's graduating soon. This year 2023 i enrol my 18 months son with medical history diagnosed. 2 school rejected him because they don't want to take risks and if I insisted to send my son to their school I must be with him at all times which I felt defeated the purpose of sending him to school. They also suggest me to send my son to special school at Awwa which I don't want because I want my son to feel that he's normal.

The teachers created an environment where every word spoken was celebrated, and every effort was met with encouragement.

"My child has been in the centre since April 2023, and I‚Äôm here to leave Kidz Meadow Jurong West a well deserved 5 stars rating review and I‚Äôll share why. The centre has left a huge positive on child & family as a whole. They most definitely deserve the five stars. According to these 5 aspects: 1.	Communication - My first communication was with the admin through a phone call, Ms Diana which is I felt that she was very knowledgeable in providing all sorts of information that I need or might need. She assisted in registering my child and the process was smooth sailing. Mdm Liyana, the principal was very warmth and welcoming during the school tour, assuring us first timer parents. She provided the necessary details through and through via their termly circular, monthly update every now and then updates which helps us working parents to stay on track. Channels such as phone call, emails and parent‚Äôs communication app were all active to stay communicated within one another. 2.	Environment ‚Äì The environment set up for the children are well planned out and engaging for children to stay attracted and interested. They keep up the standard of cleanliness and step up with necessary protocol in times of an outbreak which assured us parents that our child‚Äôs safety is not compromised at any point. 3.	Child‚Äôs progress & development ‚Äì Although my child has only been in the centre for 5 months and counting, I am happy that my child is progressing and hitting more milestones as an individual and socially. I am sold when I learnt that centre provides Malay language as a second language which is one of the top criteria when I planned to send my child. My child‚Äôs progress and development is always updated and areas to improve are always shared by the teachers so I know how else I can continue to support my child. 4.	Meaningful events ‚Äì KMJW always organised and planned meaningful events that involves the community, parents, staffs and children which I feel is really a wholesome experience to allow my child to be nurtured as an all rounded person. Events that we had seen and participated such as Hari Raya Celebration, CareerDay & Field Trip Excursion, Mother‚Äôs Day Celebration, Termly Disposition Day, Father‚Äôs Day Celebration, Fundraising Bazaar for Partidor, Parent-Child Workshop, Racial Harmony Day Celebration, National Day Celebration etc. I am very awe by the constant events & parental-involvement activities created on top of their daily routines and normal curriculum activities. 5.	Passionate & loving staffs ‚Äì I can never say enough thank you to all the KMJW staffs, especially my child‚Äôs current form teacher ‚Äì Teacher Hairah and alongside, Teacher Dilah, Teacher Seri & Teacher Tse Er who had been there for my child since her first day of school. The safety net and assurance that the teachers had built with my child had helped the transition of dropping off and picking up less stressful because the staffs really take note of what my child likes and dislikes. This goes to show the staffs in KMJW really take pride in their job to ensure bonds and rapport are build. I am thankful that KMJW has always kept a standard that is beyond my expectation and in no doubt, if I ever have another child, I‚Äôll place them here <3",0.19696969696969696,4,"['child', 'teacher', 'parent', 'day', 'staff', 'celebration', 'event', 'kmjw', 'centre', 'update', 'plan', 'provide', 'stay', 'progress', 'communication', 'build', 'necessary', 'feel', 'meaningful', 'school']",Kidz Meadow Childcare & Development Centre (Jurong West)

"After leaving Kiddiwinkie do I realise what a total mess this school is. Teachers are arrogant. Right from when you drop your child off at school. No genuine care and concern that should come from a pre-school. The outdoor premise is not clean. Full of dead mosquitoes when my husband lifted up a bucket in the garden. I had numerous talks with teachers on how to deal with my ‚Äòactive‚Äô 3 year old. Isn‚Äôt that a norm at that age though? Not to mention the massive salmonella issue they had that caused an outbreak in the school. Horrible school. Don‚Äôt trust the good reviews, talk to the actual parents who are waiting for their children outside. You will know the truth. Examples of nasty remarks: - ‚Äòcome in no need to be scared, it‚Äôs the same routine every day‚Äô *rolls eyes at kid*. - ‚Äòoh you are late again‚Äô. At my child who was 3 years old, not me.. My son refused to step into school for months. He‚Äôs usually a bold child. And this behaviour is not only to my child, it‚Äôs to other children as well. Just stand around the front door for a few days in the morning and watch the interaction with the teachers and children. You will know yourself.

I truly enjoyed my first 3 days of orientation with him although he was crying very badly due to the new environment and separation anxiety. Teacher Christlyn was very patient and experienced to try to get my son to nap in school on day 1 as I decided to start him on a full-day class right from the start. Over the initial days and weeks of the school, we get very regular updates from Teacher Christlyn, his form Teacher on how my son is adapting in school. Teacher Ivy and Tian Laoshi were also extremely patient in coaxing him whenever he cries or throws a tantrum. School must have been amazing for my son as he stopped crying at morning drop-off 2 weeks after he started school which came as a big surprise to us. It just happened one fine day! As parents, we are very elated to see our son enjoying his school so much. On 2 occasions when he had to miss school due to him being unwell and another for being suspected of HFMD, he seems restless and easily irritated at home (besides his possible discomfort). Nonetheless, we saw a sharp turn of his emotions on the night after he first returned back to school. On a regular basis, we receive photo and video updates on his school activities which never fails to warm our heart, especially during a hard day at work. Thank you! As a close-knitted team in school, we frequently see Teachers from other levels helping out in his PG class and during assembly. A big thank you to Principal Evonne's stewardship and the warmth we have been receiving from other teachers at Kiddiwinkie Cactus as well - Tr Ariel, Tr Linda, Liu Laoshi, Tr Crystal, Tr Elaine and many others whom I regularly smile and acknowledge to but not sure of their names.",0.1214528527028527,4,"['school', 'teacher', 'day', 'son', 'tr', 'start', 'laoshi', 'christlyn', 'thank', 'cry', 'patient', 'big', 'class', 'cactus', 'enjoy', 'extremely', 'especially', 'update', 'evonne', 'principal']",Kiddiwinkie Schoolhouse @ Grandstand Pte Ltd (Cactus)

Hence, we feel safe & happy to leave our kids in their good hands..

"Joyous Learning is a gem in the field of education. The reasons are as follows: 1. As a boutique enrichment centre, the communication between centre and parents is top notched (for example, special schedule changes and reminders are sent in a timely fashion and this helps busy parents a great deal in the management of their children's extracurricular lessons). 2. There is a lot of ""heart"" in the modus operandi of the centre. Firstly, they do not pre-select students. I understand some centres conduct proficiency and aptitude tests prior to enrolling the students to ensure strong good results statistics. By not running pre-selection, Joyous Learning is a true educator at heart as every child is given the opportunity to be inspired to ignite their love for learning and hone their mastery in the various subjects. 3. The teaching materials are thoughtfully planned and designed to challenge the children and level up their proficiency in the respective subjects. 5. The teachers are dedicated and passionate about their craft. This is the game-changer that sets them apart. I will like to send a special shout-out to Mr. Marcus Goh. My child enjoys lessons tremendously at Joyous Learning under the fine tutelage of Mr. Goh. At the same time, he engages his students by creating a stress-less learning environment that encourages participation and the fun methodology applied creates a higher retention rate for the knowledge imparted. He has made a difference and made learning, for a lack of better word, joyful (and meaningful). 4. Value-added information is uploaded on their blog posts and newsletter on a very regular basis. This is a very altruistic act of sharing with keen learners who are unable to gain access to paid enrichment/tuition lessons. The side effect of being a student of Joyous Learning Centre is that regular school curriculum has become somewhat boring and unchallenging but that's a good issue to have, isn't it? ;-) In summary, I highly recommend Joyous Learning as an enrichment centre.",0.2269206349206349,0,"['learning', 'centre', 'joyous', 'child', 'student', 'lesson', 'enrichment', 'goh', 'heart', 'create', 'regular', 'pre', 'send', 'special', 'good', 'parent', 'subject', 'proficiency', 'change', 'timely']",Joyous Learning

"Joyous Learning is definitely the tuition centre to go to for PSLE prep with high quality teachers and curriculum.

Weekly online tuition classes (from Apr to Sept 2020) helped him to catch up with his ""lost time"" and also gave him the confidence to face the PSLE. The teaching methodology and materials are comprehensive and well paced to run up to PSLE. Eventually his results exceeded our expectations and he scored A* for both English and Science in this PSLE 2020 ( the subjects that he had tuition with Joyous Learning).

"""Really need to share here. Greenland is an Awesome preschool!!! I shifted to Punggol since 2018 and there's only 3 preschool here. I registered both EB and MW as they are the nearest, waited for 3yrs and i decided to go Greenland because finally they have slot. I am so glad i did not get into other preschool earlier even though that caused my kid starts late, at N2. I always think those popular/ expensive childcare will be best for kids but i am wrong. What I heard from mommies friend was they don't teach so much. Most of the time its really ""child care"" playing. But here in Greenland they TEACH. Focusing more on academics which is the most important, a good foundation before then move on to primary school. Not only mine, kids in Greenland are brave, independent, read well, caring, smiley, happy. They started spelling in K1, from 5 words to 10. Both English and Chinese. (My daughter just started her P1 now and she told me her spelling in what she had in K1... So easy) i have no worries on that. And she is able to count and pay for her meals in primary school. Which a huge relief for us as parents. We do not have to do much. Greenland do everything and get them well prepared for primary school life. During school holidays, they even have theme event for learning, field trip learning, phonics rocketeer holiday workshop etc. comparing to other childcare centre i heard (even from the teacher) they did not have such arrangements and said that's too troublesome. So i asked them what they usually do during holidays? They said just go school eat nap and play toys. I couldn't imagine that. Recently MK open for registration for my youngest one. But i do not wish her to leave and change a new environment. Because she is so happy with the friends and teachers there in Greenland. I'm glad my elder graduated from Greenland. She became cheerful, smart, caring, helpful. And during her graduation last year, Greenland Sumang walk combined with Punggol drive branch. I was surprised! Both the kids from Sumang walk and Punggol drive can do very well speech and best performance i ever seen. Really a big surprise to all parents. We watch them growing well under Greenland's care. Is the best choices I've made. So happy my youngest child still have another 3 joyful years learning in Greenland before she graduate. Everyday just so happy to see my kids go to the school with big smile. Sincerely appreciate their hard work. Principal, Teachers and admin in Greenland Childcare Sumang walk always sweet and caring.

"BE WARNED, PARENTS! Most of the reviewers here gave 5 stars to all their branches, go figure. Next, you can read my experience. During their open house, we were promised that our kid could start playgroup with them in November 2023. We believed them and enrolled with deposit. We waited for few weeks, during which even rejected school nearer to our place. Recently, we felt the need to confirm our admission because Greenland kept silence all this time, but was told November isn't possible, must wait for Jan next year because ""that open house was for Jan"". Their only solution for not being able to keep their words was for us to enrol into the new school first then transfer to Greenland in Jan (I applaud them!). Of course, according to their policy we can't get the deposit back, even if they tricked us in the first place. No apology whatsoever, as if this is really just our problem and our decision to make. It's dishonest and disgusting. Honestly, I don't feel OK to leave my kid with them any more.""",0.09994318181818182,4,"['jan', 'wait', 'house', 'deposit', 'greenland', 'school', 'enrol', 'november', 'feel', 'place', 'open', 'kid', 'warned', 'possible', 'course', 'disgusting', 'start', 'trick', 'year', 'solution']",Greenland Childcare @ Sumang Walk Pte Ltd
"""Greenland childcare is a premier childcare that provides pleasant learning experience for children and certainly a preschool that prepares the children well for primary school. The staff were nurturing, understanding and relatively accommodating to parent's request. My son recently graduated while my daughter is still attending class in Greenland. I am always amazed with Greenland's pedagogy as my children are able to recite and speak languages that I find it difficult to teach them. On the team of teachers, the childcare principal, Ms Puva and her team definitely stood out for developing nurturing approach for the children in Greenland childcare. Their passion for early childhood education was evident in the way each teachers interacted with each child, meeting their individual needs with patience and kindness. There are always different engaging activities planned for the children, from hands-on learning experiences to imaginative play sessions and outdoor learning journey as well. The learning environment at Greenland was nothing short of impressive. The classrooms were bright and inviting, filled with colorful educational materials and age-appropriate toys that sparked children's curiosity and creativity. The curriculum was well-rounded, encompassing a variety of activities that catered to children's social, emotional, cognitive, and physical development. What stood out to me the most was the sense of community and collaboration fostered within the childcare center. Children were encouraged to work together, share ideas, and respect one another's differences. The teachers also worked seamlessly as a team, ensuring that each child received personalized care and attention throughout the day. As a parent, I can confidently say that Greenland provides an exceptional learning environment for young children. The dedicated childcare principal and her team go above and beyond to create a nurturing and enriching space where children can learn, grow, and thrive.

"Both my boys studied and graduated from Greenland Fernvale and my younger one is this year 2023 K2 graduate. Indeed, he only joined the school in K1 while most of his classmates started since nursery/infant. I still rmb he was a crying clingy child when he first joined. But I am so blessed to have his K1 and K2 class teachers- Teacher Mae and Lei Laoshi. They always gave my boy big hugs, encouragement and even told him/ other kids in his class that can treat them as mummy/ daddy in school which let him felt more secured and loved. They literally treat their class students as their own kids. Other than comforted my boy, they also comforted me by kept me updated on his progress in school and gave me confidence that he was coping well in school. At the beginning, I was worried about his speaking and social skills, but few months later he just improved dramatically and in latest PTC, teachers even mentioned he sometimes talked too much to his friends..opps..haha. Throughout these 2 years, the school/ teachers arranged a lot of different activities both inside and outside school and he learned both academic and non academic knowledge which can really lessen my stress to prepare him to go to primary school. What I liked most is the school atmosphere so homely that made my boy felt secured and safe and so could express himself freely which I believed is the key factor for a kid to enjoy learning at this age with a peace of mind. I would like to take this opportunity to special thanks to all teachers/staffs who taught and took care my boys in this school.

Once my son told me this- Teacher Mae mentioned to him: ‚ÄúIf you miss your mommy and daddy, you wish to hug them, hug me. Teachers Mae and LeiLaoShi are you mommy and daddy in school.‚Äù This was truly assuring words to him, and I felt the teachers empathy the inner of every child.

"This sch deserves more than 5 stars! Both my kids, one is 6 and the other is 3 are enrolled in this centre. Trust the teachers here and place your kids with no worries! My girl started out as a timid, shy and emotional child who cried ovwe everything. But 4yrs down the road, she has blossomed into someone who speaks with confidence, friendly twds everyone and even manages her emotions well. She is able to read and write both english and chinese and this is No credit to myself because I'm a hands off mummy once I pick her up from sch. She will even share with me on what she and her teachers will chat about, and even requested to be the last to be picked up from the centre. Ask any of her classmates and I'm confident that they have their own testimonials of their child's breakthrus too! My son did have a change in teachers this year but he impressed me with how he is able to express his feelings by telling me when he is happy and when he is sad or angry. And he can come home singing songs he learnt from sch, showed me some dance steps he learnt and request to make cards for his teachers. Most of his classmatez started out as a baby in infant care and if the centre had issues, I'm sure they wldnt have continued with pg and now, PN. One of my concerns when selecting a cc back then was also hygiene. But greenland has one of the lowest hfmd and covid cases in this area. How would I know? Because my neighbours wld share updates from their sch and no immediate action was taken from the centre even when they had rising cases of hfmd.

"""Saying goodbye to the school was tough, mainly because of its inaccessible location, which can pose challenges during commuting for two working parents. But despite that, we can't thank the school enough for the incredible learning journey they provided our son over the past 9 months! Right from the start, the onboarding process was remarkably smooth, and he adapted to school life exceptionally well, showing genuine enthusiasm every day. Before school started, the principal reached out to us 3-4 weeks beforehand, providing helpful details about packing lists and uniforms. Throughout that crucial first week, both the principal and teachers kept us updated, offering invaluable reassurance to us as newbie parents and to our child. Here's what truly stood out for us: 1. Facilities: - A fun indoor playground right by the entrance - Spacious open areas with ample natural daylight 2. Accessible & Effective Communication: - The principal was always quick to respond to any questions or concerns, making us feel supported and confident. 3. Curriculum: - The curriculum encouraged independence, helping the children develop gross motor skills quickly and become competent in dressing themselves. 4. Teachers: - The high teacher ratio ensured each child received ample attention during class. - Despite some turnover, likely due to external factors, we're grateful to the dedicated teachers who remained, showing unwavering patience and dedication. We've seen remarkable growth in our son, especially in his communication skills. He now speaks more fluently and confidently, readily identifying colours and body parts. It's clear he thrives in this nurturing environment and has developed a genuine love for learning. Though it's sad to say goodbye to such a wonderful school, our priority remains our child's well-being and continued growth in a nurturing setting.

"I had my son enrolled in this school since they started with just less than 10 students and that was 3-4 years ago. The teachers were very good, caring and nurturing back then. The number of students with ratio to the compound size is also good. However, in the past 1-2 years, all the good teachers have left suddenly within a few months apart. The students increased drastically and the place suddenly became so crowded. Eventually, we decided to withdraw my son out from the school even though he have established and made many friends. It is a hard decision but these are a few points that we have considered before withdrawing him 1. Poor updates from school (this only happens after the good teachers left) 2. Ever since the good teachers left, my son teachers keeps changing. I felt that this is not good for him as he have to keep adapting to the new teachers. 3. Not much activities being done, every day is just about tracing and practising writing which I think may be the easiest way for the school (just worksheets) but too much for the students. 4. Sometimes I waited 10 minutes just for someone to open the door to send my son into the school. Once I missed the smooth traffic hours, this could lead me to another 20-30 minutes for me to reach my office (often resulting in me being late for work, esp when I have meetings in the morning) However, I want to give praise to my son Chinese teacher. She is one of the better teacher who did not leave the school.

"My child has been attending this school since PG, and her learning has improved as of late compared to the past, this could only be attributed to the attention that the teachers are giving to her. Previously I realized that she did not really enjoyed going to school for classes and only had wanted to engage in play time. Ever since she had a change in teachers I began to notice that she shares more about what she does during lessons and that she actually enjoys school and classes. This is especially contrasting to what some of the other parents feel, but there is no perfect school nor perfect teachers. Instead of lambasting and lashing out, parents ought to be more appreciative of the teachers. They are there daily at 7am, even though most of them have their own children and family, though it is their job, they are humans as well and they have their own emotions and thoughts. In this day and age where it is easy for everyone to be critical and to be heard, everyone should take a pause and evaluate the situation in fairness first before critiquing.",0.16150793650793652,4,"['school', 'teacher', 'enjoy', 'parent', 'perfect', 'child', 'class', 'especially', 'begin', 'family', 'fairness', 'time', 'contrast', 'feel', 'easy', 'lesson', 'lambaste', 'instead', 'compare', 'evaluate']",First Steps Preschool @ MacPherson
"Not sure why my review keeps getting removed from the page. Below review by another parent is 100% accurate. Initially, I thought we were the only affected class. But it seems across the entire school, there are problems such as poor management, lack of teachers and poor updates. Previously, school was fun and the kids looked forward to attending school. Things took a big turn once the good pioneer teachers left and the high turnover of teachers meant that the kids got to keep readjusting to new and random teachers - some eventually left too. Well, first hand witnessed how the school director/principal talked to the teachers and I can understand why some left. Seems like most teachers have to take multiple classes too due to lack of manpower and there are mainly Chinese teachers. Understand manpower crunch is a common issue in early childhood industry but this problem doesn‚Äôt seem to improve here. School updates frequency was so bad. Sometimes if you don't ask, you get nothing. Once a week not too much to ask for right? Somemore some parents were promised two updates a week when they joined. What a lie. Communication is poor as well. Most notable example, they boasted about a merger coming along, held a town hall and everything sounded exciting. Made parents go through revised administration processes and then out of nowhere said merger failed thereafter, way past the expected merger date. No accountability of how it would affect school and students. School director/principal is unfriendly and have mood swings. Not sure if she applies the same attitude to the kids in school, especially when she is also one of the teachers. When she‚Äôs in good mood, she may smile at you if she sees you. Most days, she is sulky and treats you as invisible. A bit strange as she is supposed to be the leader and face of the school. Some of the surviving teachers there are quite friendly. Just hope they are well taken care of. Location is also pretty convenient I guess. School is open concept so it can be very chaotic and noisy but also may be fun for kids as they get to know people across levels and move around the compound. Depends on your preference. @Don, perhaps it‚Äôs time you look into the operations of the school as it is currently not the standard it was when you first started this branch.",0.05630822510822511,0,"['school', 'teacher', 'kid', 'parent', 'leave', 'update', 'poor', 'merger', 'look', 'principal', 'ask', 'mood', 'good', 'fun', 'director', 'lack', 'take', 'sure', 'understand', 'manpower']",First Steps Preschool @ MacPherson
"Contrary to what some reviewers reviewed First Steps MacPherson on Google Map, I feel that the school, be it the principal and teachers are trying their best to run the place well. I'm going to rate it 4 stars as with all systems, there's always room for improvement. Starting from the Principal, how the P manages her team of teachers is up to her personal style and to the characteristics of the directed teacher. I don't think it's fair to put all the blame of high attrition rate to the P's management style. As with many of us, we change jobs for better paying environment or due to unforseen circumstances. And why is it that the Chinese teachers aren't leaving compared to the other teachers? Due to instigation by fellow English teachers? Some say that the P has mood swings. Don't we all do? Like us, the P is also human. The P also has personal, family, financial, work issues that we all face daily. What's more a P that has to deal with about 100 students + staff daily. Give the P a break man! Additionally, manpower crunch is everywhere. The MOE system has relief teachers on standby whereas Preschools do not have relief teachers to standby whenever there's a shortfall. Teachers have higher tendency to fall ill in preschools too. And with annual leaves, study leave, maternity leave etc., it is inevitable that there are manpower shortages time to time. With technology improvements, parents can now request for updates from the teachers. Having updates can provide parents with info on how well their child is doing in school. But all these updates require the teacher to be offline and not tending to the child, meaning during their break or even off work hours. Their job is not easy. And the teachers deserve their short break before kids awake from their nap. Worse case scenario is that the teacher can't rest as there are kids that need coaxing or not wanting to nap. To parents who think that this job is easy, recall how your child's birthday celebration in school was like. You would have a taste of what they really deal with in that short 1 hour of celebration. Some of us need a helper because we can't manage our own kids, can you imagine what's it like to manage 10 over kids with just 2 teachers (sometimes 1). The merger of the school has nothing to do with the P and the staff. Keep them out of upper management problems. My kids used to school in a more premium preschool. We transferred to First Step after we shifted to MacPherson. The issues we experienced in the former preschool is also evident here in First Steps. The lack of teachers, high attrition rate, good teachers leaving, not enough updates, poor management and politics amongst teachers. We've seen all these in the previous school and First Steps and we've heard similar stories from friends from other schools too. So parents, just take a chill pill. Please be grateful that in this school your kids are fed (4 times a day), soiled diapers and clothes are changed and your child isn't abused like other premium preschool. The school is trying it's best to provide the kids with a well rounded education. Outdoor play, excursions and enrichments are all provided.

"Placed my elder child on the waiting list for First Steps (previously known as Zion Kids) since I was pregnant as this place was strongly recommended by my friend. We did not change child care even after moving away as my children really loved their time here, and the other child care centres I had visited for consideration just paled in comparison. My younger child just graduated last year, and missed being in this wonderful school. The infant care was great, with the teachers and aunties not only taking care of their needs but also educating them, and kept the parents updated on their daily progress. When they moved over from the Zion babies to the Zion kids side, they had more structured curriculum on top of the treasured play time, which made the transition to primary school academically easy. The teachers were all loving and nurturing, instilling good values in the children. There were frequent updates on what the children were doing, and many pictures that became treasured memories of all the fun times they had learning and playing together. The meals were well planned, balanced and nutritious, with my children telling me their favourite meals and even sometimes asked for second servings. The school environment was clean, with good ventilation, which was an important consideration for me as I did not want my children falling sick frequently. The school would disinfect the whole school regularly, but would also quickly arrange for the disinfection when there were reported HFMD or COVID cases. No regrets sending my children here.

The school will send regular updates about the kids and will provide a lot of support to the kids when they are unwell. The teachers and parents keep close in touch via WhatsApp and I feel this provides a good channel for feedback and sharing of each other‚Äôs lives.

Parents are also kept updated frequently via the WhatsApp group chat photos and announcements. I am extremely thankful to the teachers as they have significantly shaped Valerie to who she is today. We recently also sent our son to the toddler class. Knowing and acknowledging that he‚Äôs a slow learner as compared to his sister, we didn‚Äôt expect much from the school... However, the teacher advised that we should start doing checks and enrol him in early intervention classes. After months of hospital visits, we realised that his problem is those huge ear waxes stuck in his ears! We got them removed and as of today, I am impressed to see how much my boy has progressed!

"""Not worth the exorbitant school fees, if you ask me. My biggest gripe is with the diet. Children were often fed empty carbs such as mantou with no filling, or suspiciously green pandan bao. Refined, processed sugar too, such as Milo. The meals are not prepared in school but in a central kitchen, transported to Vanda and reheated. Etonhouse prides itself on its mandarin program, but in my opinion it is no use to teach children tang poems and SanZiJing when they have no idea what they are reciting or even just the context within which these poems were written. During our time with Etonhouse there was a high turnover of Chinese teachers ‚Äî 3 in a year. We chose this school in part because it had a big, beautiful outdoor space (albeit right beside a big traffic intersection) but it was so underutilized. Children did not play outdoors daily, even in good weather. Granted, this was during the pandemic, but if they can be in a classroom together I see little reason why they cannot spend time outdoors. The facilities at this school were often broken. Almost every time there was a thunderstorm there would be a power outage. There were also a few times when the toilet facilities broke. There are some good ideas, such as a communication booklet with which you could correspond with your child‚Äôs class teacher. But guess what ‚Äî our questions and comments in the book were never responded to or acknowledged. I think etonhouse does try to prepare children for local primary schools (get ready for weekly spelling and tingxie at age 5!) but for the money EH charges, the diet and state of the facilities are just unacceptable. Fees increased by ~200 right after we left the school.

I have so much comfort from the teacher as anxious parent on how my daughter will adapt being separated from me to start her first day. The first 2 weeks was tough, my daughter would cry and throw out due to crying but teachers and the aunties there were so assuring and told me it‚Äôs okay and it‚Äôs normal. They are so patient to say it‚Äôs okay to needing to change her daily and mop the mess my daughter created due to all her crying. The daily updates from principal/teacher via WhatsApp (now they have school communicate and photo sharing App) on how my daughter are doing for the first two weeks helped me to have a peace of mind and assurance. My daughter adapted and less crying very quicker than I imagined it would be. She have learned so much in speech, identifying, socialising, writing, trying to read words, etc in English and even improved so much in her Mandarin. My spouse and I seen how our daughter grew to become so independent and the things she learnt there are really broad and sometime in our opinion deep for her age, example identifying all the planets and remembers them, saying all the shapes include ‚Äòrhombus shape‚Äô. etc. We too have our son joined the sister and seen him grew in fast pace especially in speech. My son went through a tough 1 week of separation anxiety too but very comfortably adapted to it after and love going to school.

Definitely sending! In the four years, I saw how my girl with some speech delays initially overcame her challenges and is now able to read Roald Dahl, Enid blyton!the improvement is stellar.

"""Posting this on our kids' last day here, and wishing we could bring the entire school with us. Ever since walking past the preschool and deciding to enroll the kids here because we felt good vibes, then enrolling and being really thankful we chose right, and hearing great feedback from grandparents, we had every intention to keep the kids here until they had to attend primary school. Unfortunately, plans changed and we had to move. And initially we were (to be frank) a little worried that the kids would not get the same support. But instead, their teachers actively supported us, even to the point of looking for books that covered topics about moving and attending new schools. Never thought I would be so sad about having to leave a preschool, but we are. This is an incredible school with a selection of highly motivated, patient educators who are genuinely invested in the children. A huge thank you again to their teachers: Gao Laoshi & Ms Nasha, Mr Evan, Ms Xinyi and Xin Xin Laoshi - thank you for being the reason Maya loves school and gets grumpy if we pick her up too early. Ivy Laoshi, Ms Afiah, Ee Laoshi, Ms Nadya and Ms Yin-ning - the simple fact that Kai our COVID baby who cried so badly at first and blossomed into someone who runs right in and is now so well adjusted is testament to the incredible support offered to him.

"They used to have a good principal and lots of good teachers when I enrolled my kid in year 2016. However, most of the good teachers started to leave the school one after another. In short, I do not recommend this school with their high school fee and with this quality. Pick-up/Drop-off: Very hard to pick up/drop off your kids as there's no allocated carpark. My car used to scratch by the neighbor's next door automatic gate when I was there to drop my kid. Facilities: No improvement or renovation for the facilities at all over the 4 years my kid was with them (Wall painting doesn't count). Same old playground, toys/equipment was used in the center. Only added toy is used tyres. However the school fee just continues to increase every 2 years. Enrichment: Only Phonics is useful and with certain Quality. English Speech and Drama: Normal and nothing special. Chinese Speech and Drama: In order to 'lure' my kid to join the Chinese S&D, they told the kid you get to draw (knowing that my kid loves drawing). So, I enrolled my kid for the first year. However, the teacher was seen scolding and shouting at the kids before the school concert, which obviously just want to showcase her ' good work', but not really letting the kids to enjoy the class. Thus, withdrawing my kid from the class after since. Calligraphy: Calligraphy for kids who can't even write properly with a pencil. I learned Calligraphy too, and the pre-requisite is always to be at least P3 for my time. I didn't know kids nowadays have evolved so much to be able to take on this at such early age. My personal encounter: My kid was lucky enough to be taught by one of the ex-teachers, and she was a very committed teacher, which my kid's Chinese has improved over the 3 years with her. However, the English teacher was not professional enough and not equipped with the correct skill (The teacher is still with the center). During the PTC, when I asked the teacher how we can work together to improve some of my kid‚Äôs skill, the teacher told me ""I don't know how to handle your kid, I am not an expert"". When I feedback this to the principal, the answer from the principal is that you cannot expect all teachers to be so committed like the Chinese teacher.

"My son joined Children‚Äôs Cove Sembawang Shopping Centre last December. It‚Äôs the best decision I have made for him. I have visited several childcare centres before I settled on Children‚Äôs Cove. The student-teacher ratio is the lowest with a ratio of 6 to 1 for playgroup.

The centre has also employed 2 aunties, 1 for the cooking and 1 for general cleaning. Hygiene level is always their priority. At the other end of the school is a door which directly opens and leads to the building‚Äôs playground. Communication with the teachers is prompt via the apps. They keep us updated with photos during the weekly update and on ah-hoc basis whenever interesting moments of my son occur. My son‚Äôs main teacher-in-charge is a very assuring teacher who is bubbly, meticulous and always willing to go to the extra miles to ensure my little son and all children are safe, sound, happy and on track to reach their development milestones. His Chinese teacher is a very enthusiastic lady who spices the class with excitement, engages and sparks the curiosity of my son to learn. I have no issue to address any concerns to the teachers promptly. This is a close-knit community. The teachers are bonded to the children, parents and among each other. I like how thoughtful the principal and teachers are, for instance, arranging to dress up in same colour code during excursion for easy recognition or even having flower petals on their hair which was just to create little spices for the Parents' Day event.

"Hi, my son attended this childcare many years back however I remembered it vividly. I was told the incidents of HFMD was minimal however the exact month my son was there, he was down with HFMD, and on the 3rd month too. During one incident when he was down with fever, the teacher locked him up in the room on L2 till dismissal (when they should have just called us to pick him up earlier). Few months later, we observed bruise marks on his arms on a few occasions. The principal and teacher said it‚Äôs due to ‚Äúplay with other students‚Äù. After so many unpleasant incidents, we decided to forego the deposit and take my boy out from Cherie Hearts at Charlton. How would we even want to continue that last month (after reporting these unpleasant incidents to the principal and teacher)? These kind of experiences can leave scars on children for years! In fact, they even leave psychological scars / guilt on parents - I‚Äôll think why I gave this childcare centre so many chances? What else happened to my kid (prior to my discovery?). Could all these be avoided if only I trusted my gut feel, (as well as granny‚Äôs observation outside the centre) and take him out earlier? Am so glad nowadays, the policing of childcare sector is more stringent. There‚Äôs definitely a lot of improvements in the childcare space! Why I‚Äôm sharing this review is because of a Straits Times article today about similar incident which happened to a 3yr old boy, (which ignited the bad memories).

"Cherie Hearts at Charlton introduced programs which are beyond the curriculums/lessons like I love Reading Day, Young Entrepreneur Day cum Start Small Dream Big - Charity Drive and Family Day cum Children‚Äôs Day. Yesterday we celebrated Family Day cum Children‚Äôs Day at Bird Paradise. The children had fun together with their friends and parents. It‚Äôs good opportunity to bring the kids out together with their friends and this is also a day which the kids look forward to. I hope the school continues to introduce such learning programs to teach children and a way for parents to bond with their children through such programs.

"cherie hearts is a school that is fun for the children. as a practicum student, i enjoyed the culture initially when i first started in the centre, but towards the end it was not as welcoming, particularly from the teachers in my class. however, this is only my experience as a practicum student. if you are looking for a centre for your child, this review can be dismissed. given a chance to work with a different class with different teachers, perhaps my experience would be better :) either way, thankful for the experience and thank u Teacher Noni for being so approachable and kind. also, i think food wise, it would be better to have more nutritious food for the children and teachers",0.32261904761904764,4,"['teacher', 'experience', 'child', 'practicum', 'centre', 'food', 'different', 'class', 'student', 'well', 'heart', 'enjoy', 'kind', 'noni', 'work', 'approachable', 'welcoming', 'start', 'cherie', 'end']",Cherie Hearts @ Charlton Pte Ltd

"My boy‚Äôs graduating from Cherie Hearts at Charlton this year. Looking back, I have no regrets with choosing this place to be his second home. When we first enquired with the school, we dropped in to pay a visit to view the place and see how the students and teachers were. This was a few years ago, but I recall the elements of safety in the premises and willingness to inculcate lessons on things like recycling on top of the regular curriculum stood out for me. The school itself, I like that it‚Äôs an actual house instead of some unit in an office area or a void deck. It gives the children a nicer environment to be in. They also have regular trips to the nearby park so the kids get fresh air and are in a safe and quiet area all day too. I feel like my boy has learnt plenty from the curriculum. But beyond that, activities that encourage Green initiatives and creativity have helped nurture him in other ways apart from just the academic. If you are curious about enrichment options, there are plenty. From football, to ballet, to art, to abacus, there are options for different skill sets and it‚Äôs all conducted in-house, so it‚Äôs also great for parents who don‚Äôt have the logistics to send their kids to another place for extra classes. Over the years, I‚Äôve been both impressed and keen to join in on trips and excursions for the kids, just to be a part of their activities and bond with my boy more. The more educational ones have been interesting, but the more ‚Äúfun‚Äù ones like the big cycling events and the K2 camp were really great to join or spy on the kids from afar. The school also gives termly reports on your child‚Äôs progress, but will also reach out to you whenever necessary to update you on your kid‚Äôs happenings in school if required. They are transparent and open with their communications to you, so you can feel at ease. They truly work with you too. My boy will miss coming to this school for many reasons - his friends, his teachers, the staff, the place too. I will also miss attending their events with my boy and other parent-friends too. Your kid will also learn to ride a bicycle pretty fast when you get to K2 with the school! Also, Congratulations to Ms. Brands Ng and the whole school for hitting 20 years! Truly, the school of love.",0.2152777777777778,5,"['school', 'kid', 'boy', 'year', 'place', 'like', 'option', 'give', 'feel', 'parent', 'area', 'event', 'truly', 'trip', 'activity', 'learn', 'miss', 'plenty', 'join', 'child']",Cherie Hearts @ Charlton Pte Ltd
Cherie Heart at Charlton introduced multi-literacies curriculum-based learning that enhances children‚Äôs holistic growth and allows them to gain personal success and develop a joy for learning.

"Cherie Hearts @ Charlton is a place where you leave your kids for learning and have a peace of mind at work. We send our daughter there when she was 4 after trying a few daycares around our area which she does not fit in. The commitment of educating the child starts from the owner Ms Ng right down to the cook aunty Yup. My daughter takes this place as her second home. She built friendships that she carries with her till these now at the age of 11. When Teacher Cecilia calls for assistance in events the girls never fails her. This is the type of bonding the child has with the school. Besides the normal curriculum, the school provides lots of extra enrichment for the kids to try on and that enable us as parents to spend quality time with our kids after work and during weekends. Ms Ng stresses a lot on family bonding . She even organised family outings for the family may it be overseas or local; we never missed it. We have never felt more at ease when we dropped off our daughter every morning. Thank you Ms Ng and staff of all the care and hard work.

"Attending Cherie Hearts @Charlton is one of the best decisions we have made for our kids. First and foremost, we love that there is a good connection between the school and the parents, taking us along the learning journey of our children. We feel at ease especially with the regular and somewhat prompt updates of their weekly activities and matters. Just a few months into their(our kids) 1st years in school, we noticed a vast improvement in language, motor skills and attitude towards learning. I feel the Teachers there exudes a certain level of passion, and love for nurturing children, that they sincerely care and wants the best for each child. This leads to another point we love about Cherie Hearts @Charlton; Character-building, which in my opinion, is extremely important in the foundation years. My kids will excitedly go on and on about what the teachers said or what they did in class almost everyday after i pick them from school (less the few moody days) We are happy the kids are enjoying their time in school. A well-organised and a very balanced cirriculum i must say! Thank you Branch Director Ms Ng and her team of teachers for your hardwork and dedication. Cant wait for my daughter to join in Oct!

Always personally at the school gate during drop off and pick up timings so that we at least can catch an update. Love that this school has cctv, we can check out what the kids are up to throughout the day. Our experience has been very positive! Ms Ng knows her kids very well and would not hesitate to help and assist when we need. They put in great effort to help the kids adjust especially when my boy took a long time to overcome the separation during his first month at school. Many updates via WA throughout the day making sure he is well taken care of. For younger classes, they also make sure at least one teacher from the previous year would follow the kids up to the next class so that the kids would have a familiar teacher in the new level. I love that they offer enrichment classes in the school itself so my boy can attend extra classes within school without us having to ferry him to external enrichment lessons.

I have the videos of you (1) storming into the school compound, (2) behaved rudely to the teachers and (3) u fell mainly because of careless. I wanted to post it for many to review but u deleted your post before I can do so. Nevertheless, I have printed screen shots of your comment in this review, implying my kids to be ‚ÄúSelfish, self centered & inconsiderate‚Äù. To many out there, this lady, Ms Inez, choose to walk this path (nearest to school) during peak hours where many parents drop their kids to school everyday. The school is located within a landed cluster and in order to prevent traffic congestion, at each time 2 cars need to inch over the pavement to allow other cars to drive through. Fyi (1) there is another exit point approx less than 15m (approx less than 15 steps) away & (2) the exit thats nearest to the school was applied by the school director by means of official application & approval for parents who commute to school by means of public transport or foot. In the video, you will be able to observe that the paveway though obstructed marginally by the cars, theres still ample space for both abled and disabled man to walk through with ease. If I were to describe, even a hippopotamus can scroll through with ease. Also in the video, you will be able to observe her making statements to the teachers while walking away. She didn‚Äôt observe her path and obstacles and that led to her falling down like a log & sustained abrasion on her knee as reflected in her previous Fb posting. In a nut shell, everything didn‚Äôt fall in place for her that morning & she blamed the school for everything.

"""Best school ever! The staffs, teachers and principle of Chatsworth Preschool are really dedicated individuals that strive to nurture every individual children at every stage of their learning process and growth in the school.

"My son 2.5 year old son attended Playgroup at Chatsworth Preschool at Piccadilly in May 2023. Unfortunately, our experience has been deeply disappointing, prompting me to share these concerns on Google Review. Within just two weeks of enrolment, we received an email highlighting issues with his adaptation, leading to a premature assessment and labelling. Despite my efforts to address these concerns with the school, including a phone call with Principal Ms. Farah, I felt dismissed and pressured to withdraw my son during our conversation. Subsequently, we received regular negative emails from form teachers and Principal Farah, despite evidence of my son's progress, supported by videos I provided. A distressing face-to-face meeting in September 2023. The atmosphere during the meeting was uncomfortable, with Ms. Linda the admin person appearing stand-offish. An ultimatum was given to my son by Ms Linda saying that he would not be promoted and demanded us to withdraw him immediately. This experience has left us profoundly upset and raises concerns about the professionalism of the staff especially considering the school's approach to child development and parental collaboration. Nevertheless, we also brought our son to seek professional assessments from various therapists and they found NO Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) symptoms, contradicting what the Chatsworth staff blindly suggest (without explicit confirmation) that has contributed to an unwarranted urgency to remove my son from the school. In my plea to let my son stay on in school, I agreed to try out therapy to address concerns. I've requested time, explaining that early intervention takes time to show results, but an unreasonable ultimatum was given, stating he must show compliance by November, which anybody will know is an unachievable goal within a two-month timeframe. More communication consistently emphasized potential conditions such as ASD and ADHD, causing unnecessary stress without proper confirmation from qualified professionals. This approach not only demonstrated a lack of empathy but also significantly impacted the overall well-being of my son and our family. The final and perhaps most absurd blow came when I recently discovered that despite our decision to withdraw my son at the end of 2023, the school has chosen to keep him separated from his classmates, placing him in the playgroup classroom. *This decision was never communicated to us as parents. While I understand speech and developmental delays that my son has, it's distressing that my son is not allowed to be with his friends for the remaining month. Placing him in a playgroup classroom seems unnecessarily isolating and contradicts a supportive environment and this isolation is an act of discrimination I decided to reach out to the HQ, and after two phone call conversations with the center manager Yvonne, I received conflicting responses. On the first call, she suggested she will do an investigation because she agreed with me that 'the school should not have mishandled this situation and that more time should be given to a 2.5 year old, acknowledging it's too early to judge especially when boys develop slower' , while the second phone call ( the next day ) she stated, 'there is nothing we can do, and I will choose to trust my team.' This is vastly different from her initial stance which left us dumbfounded. I actually came to a compromise and suggest to the centre manager Yvonne that I am fine with him being with unfamiliar younger playgroup kids but could she maybe allow him to join his batch of friends for activity time so at least he gets to learn something during his remaining time there, meanwhile for day to day routines he can be with younger group if that means making 'life easier for the teachers'. But alas, she told me no. Even this, she was not able to do. I actually feel sad for my son, and helpless as a mother, there is nothing I could do to stand up for him. Leaving this review is our last resort, as we want to prevent others from going through what we experienced.",-0.011274509803921568,1,"['son', 'school', 'time', 'concern', 'playgroup', 'withdraw', 'suggest', 'leave', 'phone', 'give', 'day', 'despite', 'receive', 'experience', 'allow', 'feel', 'remain', 'decision', 'actually', 'face']",Chatsworth Preschool - Piccadilly Campus

As soon as I tell him he is going to school he immediately and hastily runs to the toilet to shower and prepare. We always have this debate every Friday night as to why he does not have to go to school on Saturdays and Sundays, clearly he is enjoying his time at school which I am pleased.

After attending school for just about 2 months, my girl has become way more sociable. She had fun and learned plenty of stuff, too. I like that the teachers are genuinely kind and loving. Mel, the headmaster, who has experience living both locally and abroad, understood my need very well as a ""parent-in-transit"" (we were new parents in Singapore and had to move to another country within short notice). She had been really accommodating and provided me with good advice. Another thing I like about Camelot is that it's located right opposite of Great World City Shopping Centre, super convenient to do some work at a cafe, do grocery shopping or go for a massage at off peak hours.

Teachers also keep us parents well informed about our child‚Äôs progress. Our daughter has grown leaps and bounds under their guidance, developing crucial skills while fostering a love for learning.

From the moment we entrusted our little one into her care, Teacher Hani has not only been a teacher, but a devoted partner in our daughter's growth and development.

"""My child enjoys the excursions that the school organizes once every 2-3 months. The teachers also provide sufficient feedback, support and advice when consulted on my child's progress in school. The teachers in general are welcoming and work well with us. However, the recent increase in school fees of about 30% from 2023 to 2024 is of grave concern. The school had informed that this was due to the implementation and investment of more AI tools for the children to learn. However, this substantial increase does not seem justifiable. The introduction of the ""AI math"" tool was announced in March 2024 but the school fees have already increased since Jan 2024. One would somewhat expect that the implementation of the tool will be in line with the increase, given this substantial increase in school fees of $400.

"My child has attended this pre school for the last 2 years. The first year was relatively okay given the caring and attentiveness of the teachers. However as he progressed to the next grade, the turnover of the teachers became very high and there were several incidents of favoritism and unprofessional behavior of the teachers towards students. What is more intolerable is the unprofessional attitude of the principal, whose defensive nature often brushes away the concerns of the parents. What is more appalling is the business-minded attitude of this principal who did not even bother to acknowledge us when we decided to withdraw our child. That 180 degree change in attitude tells us that this is a pre school whose philosophy is based on one single thing and that is money. Our child is fortunate to make many good friends who have eventually decided to leave this school as well. One can only hope that with the new principal will infuse strong ethical principles worthy of a professional educator. Update: In a desperate bid to retain the students, the school has dished out rebates/discounts to the remaining students in an inconsistent manner that is not transparent. Again, this has proven that the school is only focused on monetary value and not on professional or educational enhancements for the children.

My niece and nephew are students at this school, and my family would like to sincerely and ardently thank the teachers and Principal Irene for their genuine love and meticulous care for each of their students! I remember when my niece first started swimming lessons in K1 last year, she was very scared of the water and didn‚Äôt want to go for the swimming classes. Qiu Yi Lao Shi encouraged her not to be scared and scaffolded her, sitting beside her near the swimming pool first to encourage her to get familiar with the environment while her classmates had their swimming lessons. The next time, Qiu Yi Lao Shi encouraged my niece to dip her feet in the waters. Slowly but surely, my niece gained courage and joined in subsequent swimming lessons. She‚Äôs now a little radiant and enthusiastic swimmer and guess what her favourite subject in school is? It is SWIMMING! Thank you Qiu Yi Lao Shi for believing in her and seeing potential in her! Qiu Yi Lao Shi is also now the teacher of my younger nephew in N1 this year. I admire and thank her, Teacher Ran and Lu Lao Shi for taking care of him and the young students so, so, so well!

"A school led by a principal with little integrity and teachers with poor communication and great defensive skills. My child attended school for almost a year. Prior to attending school, she had never developed diaper rash before. Diaper rash was a recurring issue since the beginning of school. I had to take leave initially to nurse her skin back. Only to have her develop diaper rash again when she returned back to school. We tried very hard each time to nurse her skin back over the weekend, only to have the diaper rash recur again on a Monday. The teachers were mostly defensive and pushed the blame to extrinsic factors like wrong diaper brand, wrong wet wipe, wrong cream. FYI, there were the very same ones we had been using since she was born. It improved for 3 months somewhere down the road after we made a big fuss about it when it got to a point where her rash was so bad. We got her seen by a Dermatologist who identified the cause as poor hygiene due to infrequent diaper change. From then on, she develops diaper rash every now and then and her skin will be all good for 1-2months after each time we make a complaint. The last straw was when she developed diaper rash again after promoting to N1. Being under a new team of teachers, we do understand that it takes awhile for them to grasp the care of each individual child. However, the response that ticked me off was from Teacher Sha where she quoted that they have already been changing it very promptly and frequently for my child. Even more regularly compared to other children in the same class. She gave me an ultimatum, it is either we No. 1 change doctor, no. 2 change diaper brand or no. 3 change the diaper cream we're using. I went for option 4, change school. Had the teachers be alittle more empathetic and apologetic and less defensive in their tone, we probably would have stayed on. Then came the last issue just before we completed the last month notice in the school, where the school FAILED to notify us of the HFMD cases even though my child was technically still a student there. In my conversation with Principal Irene over the phone to clarify this matter, she even lied about the timing the communication app was disabled, stating that it was only late evening when in fact ECDA wrote back stating it was at noon. (Refer to photos for email records of me writing in to ECDA and Cambridge Head Office). No sense of social responsibility at all, they simply don't care since child will not be returning to their school anyway. Aside to all these, some other minor issues are like very little update and upload of photos. Their teacher to student ratio is also not as good as what was marketed during the pre-enrolment phase. We have only met ONE good teacher in our journey with Cambridge, Teacher Denise. She demonstrated that she genuinely cared for the children and has excellent communication skills when it comes to reassuring us parents. It was a pity to have her leave the school. I guess there is a reason why good teachers choose to leave. Overall, I find no sense in paying a premium for a school of this quality. There is a reason why there is always a vacancy in this school when everything else in the vicinity is full.

"I do not recommend this preschool at all. There was a change in management 1-2 months after my child started infant care and things only got worse. My child's items were frequently misplaced even after I have labelled them and other children's items also got placed into my child's bag (e.g LABELLED soiled clothes and milk bottles, breast milk bottles, socks). I continued to put up with this because I felt that the teachers were quite ok and my child seemed to enjoy school. However, when my child turned 12 months, she suffered 4 bruises to her head within a span of less than 1 calendar month. One of the incidents was not even reported to me until I approached the school to ask about the bruise. The school claimed that this was a miscommunication and there was ZERO apologies made for this incident. I had to ask to speak to management about the frequent injuries and the school pushed the blame to my child for being fussy/difficult instead. Some pointers for potential parents to consider: 1. The most serious of the bruises was caused by a half door banging into my child's forehead. Apparently the teachers frequently close the door behind them without looking out for infants behind. Management said they have tried to ask the teachers to correct this action to no avail. You may interpret this however you like. 2. My child was in the centre from 3m to 12m. How is it possible that during this whole time, she could not be accustomed to more than 1 or 2 teachers? Did the teachers try enough to engage her? FYI she does not have this problem in her new school and her new teachers mentioned that this could be due to being insecure. 3. 2 of the bruises were caused by her head hitting furniture/doors. It is basic for an infant care centre to be childproof right? There are clearly lapses in childproof in the centre but the management maintains that my child (and one other child at most) are the only child that injured themselves instead of admitting that they need to look into further childproofing. 4. My child was supposed to transition to older infant group for 12 - 18m (which has a lower teacher:child ratio if 1:4 instead of 1:3 in case you also did not know) but this transition was delayed due to shortage of manpower at the older infant side. My personal belief is that this also contributed to my child's injury because she was not being engaged sufficiently at the younger infant group and hence wanted to stick to her preferred teacher. 5. My child has eczema and had to wear socks (with grip sole) to protect the wound. The centre said this caused my child to fall as being barefooted has better grip. In comparison, the new school said socks are a requirement for all children. Please interpret this as you wish. This centre has caused a lot of grief for me as I had to transfer my child out with less than 6 months to go in infant care. I regret not transferring my child out earlier. If you are unhappy with the care your child is receiving, I suggest you consider a transfer ASAP.",-0.0012544273907910332,1,"['child', 'teacher', 'infant', 'school', 'centre', 'care', 'month', 'cause', 'management', 'bruise', 'say', 'ask', 'transfer', 'sock', 'instead', 'door', 'new', 'group', 'engage', 'incident']",Cambridge @ MacPherson

"""As a parent deeply invested in providing a holistic and enriching educational experience for my child, enrolling them in a Montessori school has been a game-changer. The Montessori philosophy is not just a method of education; it's a transformative journey that fosters independence, creativity, and a love for learning. One of the standout features of our Montessori experience is the child-centric approach that permeates every aspect of the curriculum. The classrooms are carefully designed to stimulate curiosity and exploration. The materials used are not just tools for learning; they are gateways to discovery. Watching my child engage with the carefully crafted Montessori materials, I can see the joy and enthusiasm that comes with hands-on learning. The teachers at our Montessori school play a pivotal role in creating a nurturing environment. They act as guides, fostering a sense of responsibility and self-discipline. The emphasis on respecting each child's pace of development has allowed my child to progress at their own speed, building a strong foundation for future academic success. What sets Montessori apart is the emphasis on practical life skills. From pouring their own juice to cleaning up after themselves, children are encouraged to take ownership of their actions. This not only instills a sense of responsibility but also enhances fine and gross motor skills. Witnessing my child confidently tackle daily tasks has been immensely rewarding. The community aspect of Montessori education cannot be understated. The mixed-age classrooms encourage collaboration and mentorship among students. Younger children learn from their older peers, while the older ones reinforce their understanding by teaching. This dynamic fosters a sense of community and creates a supportive learning environment. Communication between parents and teachers is open and transparent. Regular parent-teacher meetings provide insights into our child's progress, allowing us to actively participate in their educational journey. The Montessori school doesn't just educate children; it educates parents, creating a partnership that enhances the overall learning experience. In conclusion, our Montessori experience has been nothing short of exceptional. It goes beyond traditional education, nurturing the whole child ‚Äì mind, body, and spirit. The emphasis on independence, hands-on learning, and community engagement sets Montessori apart as a beacon of educational excellence. If you're seeking an educational journey that inspires a love for learning and prepares your child for a lifetime of success, a Montessori education is undoubtedly worth considering.",0.22675438596491235,4,"['child', 'montessori', 'learning', 'learn', 'education', 'parent', 'educational', 'experience', 'school', 'community', 'create', 'teacher', 'journey', 'sense', 'foster', 'emphasis', 'old', 'love', 'environment', 'skill']",Brighton Montessori Centres Pte Ltd (Mountbatten)

"Was fine until we got a new Form Teacher for K2, who could not speak or write proper English (eg mixing up gender, and singular vs plural terms), and made frequent marking mistakes in both Eng and Math. Felt she was hardworking and caring though, and perhaps could make a good Mandarin teacher. But, learnt later that inappropriate remarks were made to the children, that could terrify or scare them (about throwing them out, etc).. Seriously inadequate carpark facilities, esp after merger with GreatWorld branch. Imagine total of more than 100 children, in a facility with only 8 outdoor lots (no shelter), out of which, 6 lots are located dangerously close to the canal, and laden with uneven or broken concrete slabs and stones all around (my child fell at a lot and got injured once). Despite numerous reminders not to throw anything, they still lost some of my child's work and craft done at school (6 out of 8 items I tried to get, were lost, guess thrown away) :( Overall, not worth the high fees, as even the government or government-related centres had teachers who spoke and taught better Eng, and who displayed more sincerity. Here, no viable action was done to rectify the issue of the lack of Eng standards in a kindergarten level teacher who taught Eng and Math, and not a single word of apology was given to address the fact that changing school in the middle of the final yr of kindergarten posed so much hassle to us.",0.03945967612634279,5,"['child', 'teacher', 'eng', 'lot', 'throw', 'math', 'speak', 'lose', 'kindergarten', 'teach', 'school', 'facility', 'government', 'get', 'centre', 'display', 'close', 'fee', 'esp', 'greatworld']",Brighton Montessori @ Crystal Court

Great childcare is not just about looking after children, it should be an extension of the family - where the teacher and other staff members, from those that prepare meals to those that manage and run the centre, put in extra effort to ensure the children get the love and care they need.

"My eldest graduated half a year ago and my youngest is still with Blossom. They enjoy Blossom tremendously. I love fetching them from Blossom, listening to them chat about what they learn and enjoy in school. My eldest really struggled with phonics in her kindy years and her form teacher worked closely with me to support her in grasping reading. She was aware of my eldest‚Äôs introverted personality and took into consideration of that while teaching her. My girl breezed through reading by graduation. Blossom is also aware of the struggle parents have with Chinese language and has done up a solid curriculum to help children transit to P1 Chinese well. My eldest still enjoys singing with her younger sister of the Chinese songs and poems her blossom teachers have taught her. Blossom teachers really make learning fun for them! Academic aside, the thing that really stands out for me for Blossom is the teachers. They are warm and caring and are often able to quickly give feedback on my children whether it is during PTM or casual chatting during pick up, which reflect their understanding and love for my children.

"This is a very well-run school with clear management and structure as well as a deep passion and love for kids and their education. My daughter‚Äôs passion for life, school, the teachers and her school friends say it all. Blossom is exactly what kids do at this school. Our daughter has been attending since 2018, we love Blossom Creative Bedok and could not recommend more highly. Not convinced? Please read about our experience ÔÅä Finding a school for your playgroup/kindergarten age child can be incredibly stressful. I have 4 kids and each time round I was just as nervous. My youngest was not. She was adamant she wanted to go to Blossom Creative Centre Bedok. She had seen it walking past and was sure that is where she wanted to go. I arranged to see the school and was convinced in 30 seconds that she had made a super choice. A very well thought out syllabus, clear objectives but also a more holistic approach ensuring kids get play, art, music and fun too. Her first day she walked in and didn‚Äôt even look back. Every day I pick her up and ask ‚Äúhow was your day?‚Äù her reply is ‚Äúgreat!‚Äù. She is on a half day but some days asks to do a long day she has so much fun. Blossom really was the greatest find! The location is such a wonderful space, with a garden to play, a nice welcoming entrance and Teachers that greet with warm and wonderful smiles. Even through COVID the community feel/support between parents and the school has been beyond words. We love the Teachers! Their personal touch and effort to build relationships is evident from how my daughter adores them but their passion does not stop there. They use creative ways to teach the kids; music, activities, games, and crafts. So much effort goes into what they do. Even with COVID the Teachers have found ways to work within the restrictions and safely, but give the kids experiences they love and will remember. From role play to experience what life is like as an older person to learning about the ocean and making paper jellyfish, self expression, singing, cooking, dancing, writing, reading, numbers, Mandarin, science, computers, physical education and more; Blossom Creative have it covered. Having been there for a few years now I can vouch for their approach. My child has learnt more than I could have imagined. She comes home telling me facts that even my older kids don‚Äôt know. She loves reading and writing because Blossom Creative make it fun and have given her great ways to apply what she has learnt. We love the bilingual approach they take and the standard of teaching that ensures the kids learn what they need to. When you find your 5yr old trying to spell words like Salamander as she sings to herself a made-up song with facts about salamanders, just for fun and then breaks into a song in Mandarin you know they have the balance right. I have seen her grow in independence, academics but also her own self.

"It is very disheartening for me to write the following review for the childcare that had been taking care of my child. When I first decided to leave my child there, the teachers were friendly and demonstrated professionalism in taking care of the children. There were regular feedback and also well establish curriculum. However, lately there were quite a few teachers who left and replaced by new ones. The teachers were not only rude but also lacks passion to teach. They tend to chit chat among themselves while leaving the children to play. The most disappointing part is that there are some teachers who literally ignore you when we are there to pick up our children.

My second one is still studying at Bethesda. The opposite of her brother, she was a very shy and quite girl.

"""Before Baby Elk, we always hear from people around us on how infant care is a nightmare where the kid will always fall sick. But I think we must have lucked out here because being in infant care was one of the best decision we‚Äôve made! I think it‚Äôs really the entire team behind the centre that makes all the difference. Our son started school when he was 3 months old and honestly, he didn‚Äôt cried and adapted super well. We saw how much our son loved school, to the extent that he cried on so many occasions when he was going home. He is probably the only child who isn‚Äôt happy seeing his parents at the door.. We love seeing the updates from school and knowing what activities he gets to do for the day. Daily updates were updated very promptly which gave us a peace of mind while we work. Thank you to the team once again for all the love! Caleb is indeed very lucky to have such a fun and great experience to start his school journey!

"** Updates: In response to the management's reply since I am unable to reply to it ** - 17th Sept 2020 Hi centre managers, thanks for your reply for this review. We noticed there are quite an amount of information which was left out in your reply. We will not pursue further, since you were adamant Baby Elk was entirely responsive, and you seem to be defensive against our constructive feedback. I also appreciate acknowledging messages / calls after 6 business working days (as claimed by the centre). Perhaps its basic courtesy to acknowledged and not go missing (while claiming to check) and let parents know a response will be given by a certain date? I think no parents will appreciate messages sent but no reply for more than a week, made phone calls but no response, left messages to the principal at the centre for a return call but no response. The only response came few days after a google review was posted to ask me to listen to their breakdown and to remove my google review. I felt it was not necessary anymore because ECDA stepped in and assisted me with my enquiry. Also having sufficient teachers does not meant the teachers could cope with the workload. Have been asked not once but twice if I had any recommendation for teachers who are interested to work there. Even part timers are welcomed. And there are few occasions when my baby showered only at 3pm and was told because they didnt had time. All these made me inferred they need more manpower. No? Apart from that, I saw my baby sleeping on other babies' bed and using their pillows and blankets on 3 occasions. They had put her in the wrong bed and given her the wrong items. Other babies' bath towels were also packed into my baby's bag at times. To be honest, all of the above, I can wink it off because like I said, as long as my baby is ok. Humans make mistake and I feel that there is no need to pinpoint all the nitty-gritty things. However, if the centre is so defensive that they are providing their best already, then I feel the need to highlight that these issues should not have occurred. For my whatsapp review as screenshot by the centre, I felt that they should screenshot with the date as well because what I said was much earlier before this whole lapse of response. To be honest, even at this point in time, I would still thank the teachers for guiding my baby and loving her. There are too many more situations but I feel there is no point going on. If there are any parents who would like more information about our review, feel free to reply here and we will be happy to provide our personal experiences and the proof of which was left out in the centre‚Äôs reply to our review. May 2020 Had an unpleasant journey dealing with the management of the IFC. It is tiring to constantly have to ask for updates when you have an enquiry to check on. At times, the response comes after a few days. At times, after a few weeks or completely ignored. This is especially so when it comes to refunding of the subsidy and deposit. Prior to the recruitment, they were really pro-active in getting you to join. After which is a different story. There were many loopholes of unclear communications as well. In terms of the educarers, I think there are definitely room for improvement. But I understand that the role of the educarer is not easy and they are constantly short of teachers so many things I choose to wink off as long as my baby is not injured.",0.10467205750224617,4,"['baby', 'response', 'reply', 'feel', 'centre', 'review', 'teacher', 'time', 'come', 'message', 'need', 'day', 'ask', 'leave', 'parent', 'wrong', 'honest', 'management', 'occasion', 'week']",Baby Elk Infant Care Singapore

Other than being gentle and soft spoken to the kids, they‚Äôre also seen always so loving and caring. Yu Laoshi is always so bubbly and cheerful and Teacher Diya is so motherly. I appreciate the welcome greetings in the morning from all the teachers no matter which class they were from and I love the warm welcoming energy the school have. I must also compliment the Principal, Ms Chew for putting in the effort together with the school, to come up with lots of activities and celebration for the kids. I really love the recent sports day that was held. Activities involving families is something I cherish. It‚Äôs something I get to do with my kid and the school. The school does not only have kind and loving teachers but their cook and cleaning aunties are also very nice and friendly. My daughter loves talking about Aunty Wong.

"My girl used to be a pickie eater and we were always worried about her weight ‚Äì that has always been the main issue every time we had her doctor‚Äôs appointment. Frequent times our Dr used to say she is on the lighter side for her age and that we needed to get her to eat more. As parents, my husband and I have always tried many different ways to get her to eat more -especially on proteins like chicken, but it has never seemed to work. Surprisingly, after she had started going to school at Ms Chew‚Äôs centre, she started to eat bigger portions and she even started to eat chicken. We have seen a drastic healthy change in her weight and we are really happy with this positive change. It took us months to make her eat more but it only took the centre less than 3 weeks. Most of the time before fetching her from school, we would always peek through her class window at what she was doing and often times we noticed her teachers -Lin Laoshi, Pan Laoshi, Teacher Aishah and another Indian Assistant Teacher playing with her and her classmates. This showed that all the teachers, even the Assistant Teachers are very engaging and they would put their heart and soul to caring and entertaining the children. This of course assured me that I have sent my child to the right childcare centre. I would also like to take this time to share that I‚Äôve really enjoyed the many celebrations that Ms Chew have included throughout the entire year and get the kids (and mummies like me) excited!

The Teachers also constantly send us photos of our girl and keep us updated of the progress, and attentive to our needs and questions raised.

"""Contrary to other opinions, I find this school exceptional. Choosing a preschool for your child is a significant decision for parents, and I'm delighted with my selection. My daughter has grown academically and behaviorally, learning things I couldn't have taught her elsewhere. This is largely due to the excellent teacher-to-student ratio, ensuring she receives ample personal attention. I feel reassured knowing she's in capable hands.
