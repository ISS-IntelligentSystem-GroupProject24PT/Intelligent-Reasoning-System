MindChamps PreSchool @ The Brooks II,"We have had the pleasure of sending our child to MindChamps @ Brooks II since 1 year ago, and we couldn't be happier with the experience.  The teachers at MindChamps are exceptional. Their dedication, patience, and genuine care for each child create a nurturing environment where kids thrive. They not only educate but also foster emotional development and social skills in a way that goes above and beyond our expectations.  The curriculum is well-structured and engaging, tailored to meet the needs and interests of every child. We've been amazed at the progress our child has made, not just academically, but also in terms of creativity, independence, and confidence.  The facilities are clean, safe, and thoughtfully designed.  Communication with the staff is seamless. We've always felt welcome to ask questions, seek updates, or discuss any concerns we might have. The regular progress reports and parent-teacher meetings have been invaluable in understanding our child's development journey.  Special events and activities are frequent, and it's evident that the staff put a lot of effort into making each one memorable, be it birthday celebrations, themed dress-up days, field trips, or holiday celebrations. The school's management also went above and beyond to create a touching video montage for my child on his birthday. We're really thankful that our child loves school and has a great time at MindChamps., As a parent, I have carefully reviewed all the comments. I must objectively state that this school indeed has many issues, and I do not recommend parents to enroll their children here.  Firstly, there has been an excessively high turnover of teachers over the past two years. Except for a few senior staff members, the entire teaching staff leaves every year.  Secondly, due to the frequent turnover of teachers, children have a very hard time adapting to the school. This has led parents to lose confidence in the school.  In summary, this is not a trustworthy school, and in recent years, the school leadership has turned a blind eye to this. The teachers I have come into contact with who left were all highly professional and dedicated. I believe that if it weren't for the extremely poor working environment, no teacher would want to leave.  It is evident that the school leadership is not very friendly to its staff, which has resulted in poor school management., MindChamps PreSchool @ Brooks II has become my second home and I feel incredibly thankful to be a part of the team at this preschool. Our little ones are our top priority and we give our best every day to ensure they receive the love, attention, and education they deserve. It's truly fulfilling to see them blossom into confident and curious individuals., Teachers are incredibly caring and patience towards my son. My son enjoys going to sch and always happily mentioning about his teachers! Teachers often kept us updated as well! Kudos to Ms Poova, ÊûóËÄÅÂ∏à and Ms Priscilla!, The school's communications is so lousy. The teachers/admin always makes assumptions.  The teacher even told my daughter that she cannot go toilet. Saying ""sorry, too bad"". As they were late for some event. Don't expect the teachers to take complete care for your kid.  And the director is always missing when issues happens. BUT She will be always there take your registration fee for your kid.  The teachers keep changing too. Seriously. I don't know what is happening.  Register your kid at your own risk. You have been warned. Definitely complaining to HQ soon.  Updates: Seems the school director doesn't seems to care what has happened and mindchamp HQ is down playing the matter.  Lost of words...  Good luck to parents that still wish to still send their kids here., My daughter started attending her pre-school from PG till now N2. Teachers and stuffs have been guiding her well, and have always feedback to us about her behaviour and performance in school. Will definitely let my daughter stay till she finish her K2., The teachers are very caring for the kids and I can see my kids growing up and learning happily. Many events and celebrations are also held to make sure learning is a happy process for the kids. Thank you Mindchamps Brooks II for the pleasant experience!, My child has experienced five teacher changes within just eight months. It appears that the school's management team does not value their teachers, leading to a high turnover rate due to a poor working environment. Despite paying a significant amount in school fees, I feel disappointed with the quality of education and learning process that my child is receiving at this institution. Therefore, I strongly encourage parents to reconsider sending their children to this school., My son joined from PG and now N2 already. The teachers were very patient and nice to him. I'm so glad that he was taken care of and grow up happily., The boss/director of this preschool lacks effective management skills. There is a frequent turnover of teachers due to bad working conditions. I have concerns about the inadequate care my son receives. I am genuinely disappointed by this Mindchamps branch., Made a very good chance for sending my daughter to MindChamp right after she hit 18 months age. She gonna be promoted to K1 for 2024, and we are looking forward to her new journey with MindChamp., Management is now paying for bots to write good review? Look at all the 5 star reviews posted at the same time. Shady pre-school. Think twice before sending your precious child to this pre-school. Good teachers have all left., Joined MindChamps@BrooksII in 2019 and can't believe we are planning our 4th K2 graduation.     Consider myself blessed to be part of the team that weathered COVID together. Now, we have a new team but the outlook is optimistic because we put our Champs first in all things., The teachers go above and beyond to ensure that every child feels safe, valued, and engaged. It's evident that they genuinely care about each child's development and well-being., Darlene has just joined N2 Brooks this year. I was concerned if she would adapt well as her previous preschool was less academic and focused on playing. Growing up in an academic focused environment, I knew the importance of giving our children a head start in the right preschool and I am pleased to say that Darlene has improved tremendously in her writing, speech and (even) eating ability! I know she‚Äôs on good trajectory and will be ready for primary school by the time she graduates! Looking forward to send her younger siblings there too., My elder daughter had been in Mindchamps since July in K1, and she had been enjoying and looking forward to going school.  Despite this short few months that she just started, she had improved academically and become more independent. The teachers and staff are very helpful and keep us updated about her progress etc especially Ms Han. We had also enrolled our youngest for 2021 N1 and totally have no qualms having our two girls under the care and teaching by Mindchamps. Thank you, MindChamps., Must say, it was such a relief when my 3yo adapted into the school easily - just a month ago. I was filled with anxieties during my son's first few days in N1 - however was eased by the school teachers and the management. They sent me photos and updated on how my son was settling down. Phew! Such an ease. A fantastic team; great teachers and staffs. This is definitely a great placement. It's through my son's expressions that I see how much he loves to be at school. He is HAPPY child. After school he sings and shares some stories here and there. Thank you Mindchamps üòä, We are so thankful for Ms Linna and her faculty of amazing educators at Mindchamps @The Brooks for everything they do on a daily basis for our children. They are always warm and full of love, and it‚Äôs always assuring to know that our children are in good hands when in school because the Teachers keep in close contact with us and respond quickly to any concerns we may have. The centre is also big on being GREEN and eco friendly so you will see really creative displays done up by the Teachers using recycled materials in school. This is wonderful as it teaches our young ones not only about saving Gaia but also how we can be less wasteful and more creative! Truly an amazing team and we have nothing but great things to say about them. Can‚Äôt wait to start our younger one in PG next year!, A bright, well decorated centre, feels safe for young children. I will surely recommend to my family and friends, Dearest MC @ Brooks II staff,  A rose for everyone to start school! It has been a trying period and thank you for persevering!  Thank you especially to the teachers who had to bring their lessons online overnight as well as be there for limited services.  Thank you cleanliness captains for working extra hard to keep the school clean.  Thank you chef for looking after the children's diet.  Thank you all backend staff for coordinating and doing all the admin work.  Thank you everyone in MC Brooks II!  Love, Mr and Mrs Zhang, PG Teachers are caring and responsive. They are attentive to things that may seem insignificant yet important to us eg. my son's constipation. Teacher monitors the situation n mindfully gives the supplement. I like the padded gym where my son can jump and run without fear of being injured., Dedicated staff, clean and bright environment, a conducive school for young children., Good experience. Dedicated teachers and management team. My child enjoys going to school., Good study environment, highly recommended!",0.23031258447434932,school,Facility_Factors
MindChamps PreSchool @ Woodlands,"The signature show for the K2 graduation was truly impressive. It was evident how much passion and effort the teachers invested in the preparation of the show. I am deeply grateful for their dedication in nurturing our child with a champion mindset. Thank you so much!, Thank you for putting the curriculum showcase in such a short span of time. It exuded confidence from our little champs and showcased their amazing handicrafts.  I was able to see my toddler in a different light, thanks to your dedicated efforts.  Looking forward to future events! Good job planning committee üëç, Highly recommended to all. Kudos to their kind teachers, very engaging towards kids and parents. Kids learn new things every single day. The environment is very comfortable for kids and stress free for parent when you are out to work. üòçüòçüòç, Celebrated Cereal Day in school. Very well executed and had a great time with my son. The school is well run and the teachers are caring and attentive., Very creative and engaging session on the curriculum show case day., My boy experiences a very interactive and interesting learning experience. As a parent , we also have a nice experience with sport day event n show&tell event. Good job to the whole of teaching teams üëè. ‚Ä¶, All of the champs has done a great job. Awesome!! I can see all champs had fun, enjoy & build up their confident level. Good job Teachers!, I love the experience I've had with Mindchamps @ Woodlands. We've been with the school for about a year plus and I feel that the teachers and staff have been really thoughtful and loving towards my child. There's no issue with sending him to school and he adapted to the environment really quick. It speaks volumes about their level of care because my baby usually cries a lot with strangers when he was younger.  The teachers would also communicate closely with us parents to explore ways in which we can better my child's development and I am glad to know that the teachers do understand my child's temperament, development and habits really well. Thus, this has been reassuring to know that my child is in good hands of professionals who are experienced with dealing children as unique individuals.  I also love that the school's academic approach is dynamic, where teachings aren't confined to the classroom. I love how my child is able to communicate what he learned in school to me when I come home from work. More importantly, I do appreciate the occasional drops of photos through the Mindchamps app like the attached photos, where I get exclusive updates of their time in school.  I cannot thank the teachers enough for providing a loving and nurturing environment for the children. (:  extending my most heartfelt thanks, mother of Henry., Before choosing MindChamps, I visited other schools for comparison. Ultimately, I chose MindChamps Woodlands for several main reasons:  1:The school's core value is respecting children with zero intimidation. as a mother, this was my top priority. 2:The educational philosophy of the school's 10 core values attracted me. 3:MindChamps Woodlands is directly affiliated with the MindChamps headquarters. 4:The school environment is great, very comfortable, and clean. 5:The transparent curriculum planning and the careful selection of food for children made me feel more assured. Without hesitation, I chose MindChamps Woodlands. after my child started at this kindergarten, I felt reassured (i still rmb i was crying together with my son in the first few days to school.). The school's app updates on child's situations time to time daily. Most importantly, my child enjoys going to school. despite relocating (the new home being about an hour's drive from MindChamps Woodlands), we visited new MindChamps schools with the intent to transfer. However, my child firmly insists on staying at MindChamps Woodlands with their teachers and classmates. i always believe that the child's heart is pure, and I believe their choice follows their innermost preference. although it's tough, both my hubby and I respect our child's choice. This little boy strives not to be late for school every day, waking up between 6:50-7:00 am consistently for over half a year.  Whenever I ask about his favorite teacher or subject, he always says, I love all the teachers, and I enjoy all the subjects.' But he especially loves the time spent in MindGym and MindSpace. Witnessing my child's joyful anticipation of going to school every day is the happiest moment when sending him to school. Many friends send their children for English tuition, but I feel at MindChamps, I witnessed my child's gradual transformation, not aiming for the best, but improving every day,day by day,bit by bit. This is what I have seen and been most moved by in my child. The MRW and ReadAlong app at MindChamps make it unnecessary for us, a non-English-speaking family, to provide additional tutoring. Of course, this varies from person to person. However, at this stage, I've seen this in my child, and we allow him to progress at his own pace.  Over the years, MindChamps Woodlands and all the teachers have given my child warmth, care, and guidance, nurturing him bit by bit from a small boy into a confident, warm, and sunny big boy. He is graduating K2 this year. Initially, to provide 100% companionship in a warm growing environment for my child, I chose to leave the workforce. Children has to grow in each stage, and as a mother, I believe the nurturing environment and people around them, be it at home or school, are most important. At this moment, I am proud to say my best decision was choosing MindChamps Woodlands.and in primary school, Mindchamps mindspace 's art of learning and continued education on ten value attracted me again. we also signed up for mindspace without hesitation as after school student care center for my child .i believe it will be my another best decision.  Sincerely thanks all the teachers for everything ‚ù§Ô∏è. Your presence makes parents like me feel more secure. And it's because of your silent dedication and guidance that I am even prouder of everything my child has achieved., Teachers are attentive and could see they put a lot of effort in nurturing the students creativity/skills and the effort can be see in all the nice artworks from the students. Keep up the good work teachers!, Great efforts and nice performance done by teachers and students! This showcase will allow us parents to know what are learned for the year. This performance also build confidence in students!, Sent my son here from 18 months till 4! And safe to say, I am glad mindchamps has seen his progress throughout his baby years - from being a scared baby to a more confident 4 year old who is able to articulate his thoughts well:) thank you Teachers and MC Woodlands., Happy parent of a 4th year student at Mindchamps. Excellent learning, interactive classes, professional teachers and wonderful growth in children. Would highly recommend., Love the teachers and school. My child are having a great time in school!, Champs are very good. Excellent work, Hanyu Pinyin Workshop is worth attending as teachers shared on how to teach our kids in learning Hanyu Pinyin in a fun way., Top Brand winner in Preschool Education consistently for 5 Years. Unique SMILES curriculum focusing on Sensory Motor Intellectual Linguistic Emotional and Social skills.

My daughter absolutely enjoyed school everyday, Highly recommended. The teachers are kind, engaging, and patient with kids. Most importantly, they make them feel happy and welcome. The environment is great for kids, take a tour and see for yourself!, My child has been attending MindChamps @ Woodlands since he was 2 years old. Being a reserved child, he was having difficulties expressing himself openly to the teachers. Despite so, the teachers are wonderfully patient and encouraging. 2 years in, he has finally opened up more and express his needs in school. We are ever so delighted to hear about his day and could clearly tell he enjoys school a lot!  We know our child learns best through the play-based learning and is glad that the teaching methods  are align with the needs for our child.  The cleanliness and hygiene practices of the school are also commendable. It gives us more peace of mind that our child is in good hands.  Thank you to all the wonderful teachers in MindChamps Woodlands!  Max's mummy, is a great programme, both parent and champ to join together to play a games and cooking activity., Great effort and talents from teachers! Teachers here are mindful of every individual kids! All the way teachers and champsüòäüíï ‚Ä¶, Honestly a very commendable and highly impressive team of educators and support staff. Too many adjectives i could described this impressive team but it will still be insufficient for just an amazing group of people here.  My little one has grown in confidence and the difference is startling and stark compared to his previous childcare. If you are looking for a childcare that sees and treats your child qs an individual and a person then this is the best childcare you can provide for your child. I am so glad the entire staff doesn't treat my little one as a KPI.  The excellence starts from the top which is the Principal and it just flows naturally to her team and staff from the teachers and admins.  A big shout out and kudos to all the teachers and staff here who have made my little one learning journey a brilliant.  Due to relocation, we have to transfer our little one to another mindchamps but if circumstances were different I would be confident to just continue with mindchamps woodlands., Impressive: when we always wonder what is being taught or learned by kids, when we stepped into the learning environment and watch the kids perform, speak, sing & dance was amazing: thank you champs, teachers and principal, Overwhelmed by the amazing performance on the curriculum showcase day and all the effort and hardship behind this from all the champs and staffs! Thank you for hosting us!, Fun learning environment! Teachers are devoted and dedicated to educate the next gen of leaders and champs., Pleasant learning environment and teachers are all awesome! Highly recommended, The showcase was well orchestrated. The champs show great confidence and enthusiasm in their performance., Great teachers, beautiful classroom, clean and hygienic. Worth every penny, Love the professionalism of the team. Teachers are very professional and friendly. The most important thing is my boy enjoys going to school.The teachers also give us updates of his performance that make us more excited.  We are satisfied with the school's overall focus on curriculum and mindsets training. Thank you MindChamps Preschool @ Woodlands., Excellent thought, effort and time put in for the good circuculam showcase by the students and Teachers!, Very creative curriculum showcase., Great sharing on engaging preschoolers on reading actively. Thanks for sharing the tips. Would love to see more workshops organised in future. Good job organising committee! üëç ‚Ä¶, Wonderful day with teachers and students! Keep it up! Thanks for the great job., thoughtful teachers and very well balanced programme!, Encouraging to see the champs grow through every step of their learning journey as they progress., I highly recommend this school!! My son have been in Mindchamps woodlands since 2 years old, now he is 6. He loves attending school.  Teachers are caring and very attentive to the students. The programmes in school really helps engage my son. He learnt lots and grew to love Chinese too! The enrichment classes are very enjoyable for my son too. He especially love the music lessons., Truly a great place to nurture and groom the younglings. Friendly staff and timely updates on the kid's learning progress and comprehensive reports. Lesson plans are well thought of, and can you imagine a school with indoor playground + weekly cooking classes. Highly recommended., All the champs have put up a lot of  effort on such wonderful performance. Thank you., Excellent school and great teachers. My kids love going to school and have learnt alot., Great effort from the teachers & champs to come up with this curriculum engagement., My daughter has been with MindChamps Preschool Woodlands for 4 years now. Through the well designed learning programmed and enrichment classes, not only she has learnt so much but also grew to be more confident. The school has become our extended family with great shared memories., When we first visited MindChamps Preschool, my son was in awe of the aquarium at the reception area. From then, he became more excited to come to school. We would like to commend his teachers who have sparked our son's interest in numbers and art and taught him to be more independent. They also give us updates of his performance that make me and my partner more excited. Thank you for getting us involved in our child's preschool Journey!, Our daughter has been studying at MindChamps@Woodlands for almost 4.5 years. She enjoys going to school everyday. We are very pleased with the school teachers, facilities and programs.  Teachers at MindChamps are professional, caring and dedicated. We appreciate the constant communication with the teachers through app messages, face-to-face meetings, weekly and monthly reports. Up-to-date trainings for the teachers ensure the quality of teaching and learning provided to the students.  The classrooms are inviting and conducive for learning. Our daughter enjoys playtime at MindGym and MindScape. The MindScape is a new playground facility that is only available at Woodlands and Toa Payoh branches.  The program at MindChamps has allowed my child to build a strong foundation. She is able to vocalise her thoughts and express herself well. Lessons such as the show-and-tell sessions, Creativity and Theatrical Strategies have allowed her to build up her confidence and presentation skills. The Reading and Writing lessons enable her to read and write independently from a young age. She also enjoys her MindChamps Music lessons where she has learnt to play the recorder, violin, keyboard and other musical instruments. During Gourmet Moments, she has learnt about food preparation, nutrition, and different cuisines, and is proud to bring home the dish she has prepared in school.  My child has also been instilled moral values such as empathy, kindness and courtesy, and is able to care for others. We are heartened with her growth and development over the past four years and are confident that she will be well-prepared for primary school., My daughter has been with Mindchamps for about a year. The teachers had been really thoughtful and kind towards her! They got her to adapt really quickly to school and there was constant communication with the parents on the progress of my girl. Kudos to the team at Mindchamps Preschool Woodlands!!, After being overseas for the bulk of my child's pre-school years, my husband and I were in search of a pre-school that can continue to develop his social & emotional abilities, and work on his academic skills. We were impressed with the quality of works the Mindchamps' children produced during the centre visit.  In just a couple of months with Mindchamps, he has gained knowledge of  topics he was recently exposed to and has improved tremendously in his languages. The educators put in a lot of efforts in providing a well-rounded experience to develop the children holistically - from introducing the various attractions in Singapore through roleplaying, to learning musical instruments and inculcating good values.  He's always eager to share about his day in school, things he learnt and social interactions with his classmates and we believe that's a good sign that he's thoroughly enjoying his time there!, Sports day was a great initiative. Let‚Äôs have more parent-child activities!, My daughter has been with Mindchamps@Woodlands11 for almost half a year, although her attendance has been affected by COVID a little bit, but still can see her big progress in term of her english speaking, vocabulary, most importantly the confidence of communicating in english. i think we have made a right choice for her to well adapt into english speaking environment as well as keeping up with Chinese learning., The teachers are passionate in teaching, creating a positive and nurturing environment. Keep it up., Lovely school with awesome teachers üåà ‚Ä¶, A amazing place for the kids study here, Well done! Keep it up.üëç ‚Ä¶, Place with great creativity and budding talents!, Loving and caring tachers!, It was a splendid event we thoroughly enjoyed., Teachers are friendly and nice!! Highly recommend!!, Good sport day outing for child, parents and teachers., Mind champ has always got good activity, The indoor playground is one of my Champ‚Äôs fav!, An awesome experience in MindChamps, Very funny and helpful about the lesson, Superb sports meet!, Enjoy the sports day!, good experience, Good location, While many may find the fees a little on the higher end, it is well worth it as our children are nurtured into confident individuals ready to face the rigours of school life!  Paying attention to Chinese language teaching must start from life. Listen more, watch more and use more., I am very happy to have the opportunity to participate in the school program. It is very gratifying to see the hard work of the children and teachers. Thank you to the teachers for their careful teaching, so that the children can be happy, grow and learn happily., A happy day, the activities are very attractive, The children are very happy here",0.3721011557698548,teacher,Staff_and_Management_Factors
MindChamps PreSchool @ Yishun,"Teachers changed very frequently. Some teachers are very rude to kids, for they scold kids very loudly. The most failure to attend this preschool was i believed they would teach the kids very well in English and Chinese, so stopped the tutor classes in other institutions. However, i found the kid's phonics and pinyin are so poor at last..., As parents, we do our best to nurture and be the strong foundation for our child, but with Teachers, they inspire hopes, imaginations and the love of learnings!  It takes a Big Heart to shape little Minds. Thank you  MindChamps for doing a great job!, Send your kids here. They get great education., Super friendly teachers! Thanks for taking care of my niece who learnt so much from you.",0.2091477272727273,kid,Communication_Factors
MindChamps Chinese PreSchool @ Thomson,"Switched my child when she was in N2 for the main reason of exposing her to Mandarin. Overall, the school provides a nurturing and stimulating environment. Teachers are knowledgeable, patient, and creative, ensuring that every child receives individualized attention and support. The curriculum is engaging and age-appropriate, promoting holistic development. Communication with parents is excellent, fostering a strong partnership between home and school.  There is some room for improvement as I do note the high turnover rate of the staff. Overall, Mindchamps Thomson is a wonderful place for children to learn, grow, and thrive. My child loves school and looks forward to the lessons, My daughter (now in K1)  has been at this school since playgroup and my son just started playgroup this year. Enrolling my son was an easy decision seeing how my daughter has blossomed over the years at mindchamps. The smaller class sizes ensure that students get personalised attention from teachers, who are truly invested in their learning. Lessons, while conducted within the theme/topic for the term,  are nonetheless adjusted to the children‚Äôs interests, ensuring that the children remain excited to keep on learning. Indeed, the teachers make mindchamps special. It is clear from conversations with them that they are extremely dedicated to their craft and caring for the children, not just the children in the class they teach but the children across all levels. My son‚Äôs current teacher, who also taught my daughter in her nursery years, still interacts with my daughter regularly and provides me with feedback. My daughter‚Äôs teachers are also constantly looking out for my son and providing me with updates on how he is adjusting to school. I‚Äôm ever grateful and thankful to my mindchamps village for providing such a safe and loving environment for my children to learn and grow. The school has certainly gone through rough patches with higher teacher and principal turnover. But the teachers that remain are true gems and I sincerely hope the administration does everything they can to retain the teachers and provide greater and longer term stability., This preschool has inept, unresponsive franchise owners, whose poor management has caused high staff turnover and distrust from many parents.  Our child was with MindChamps Thomson Chinese Preschool for K1 and K2, graduating in 2023. We chose this school as we wanted a Mandarin-immersion programme near our home. While our child had good teachers throughout the two years there, unfortunately, the school was very poorly managed. During this period, 4 principals resigned (the 5th principal will be starting in late-Jan 2024), along with all 6 of our child‚Äôs teachers.  What is worse is that these 6 teachers left with little to no notice period given to the parents or children. This is despite the management being aware that they resigned several months ahead of time. They deliberately required the teachers not to tell the parents, giving no time for a proper farewell and showing little regard for the relationship between the teachers and the children. The school environment was therefore very unstable, making it difficult for children to form a relationship of trust with their teachers. Just imagine how your child would feel if they started trusting a teacher, only to see her suddenly depart, time after time.  During the first wave of resignations in 2022, we were among a group of 9 families who collectively wrote a letter to the franchise owners to express our grave concern. We were deeply dissatisfied with the high staff turnover and their decision to announce the teachers‚Äô departure at very short notice (i.e. 1 day before her last day). Notably, the owners did not bother to respond to us at all. Instead, the new principal tried to assure us she would right the ship. She worked hard and seemed sincere, but soon resigned as well. While we certainly considered changing school, eventually we kept our child there because of the existing friendships and the new teachers were good. It‚Äôs also rather disruptive to change school with just a year to go.  The K2 year was more stable ‚Äì we thought the management had finally met minimal standards. Unfortunately, that was not to be the case.  In mid-December 2023, both the K2 teachers left the school abruptly. Once again, the management kept the news from us until 3 days before the teachers‚Äô final day. This was baffling, given that the parents had already paid the school fees for December, so they could have given more time to allow the children to process the end of these treasured relationships.  From these actions, it is clear that the franchise owners of MindChamps Thomson are lacking in management and people skills. Worse, they do not listen to feedback. Principals did not stay more than 6 months, they could not explain the decisions of the franchise owners, and good teachers left very suddenly, in an unnecessarily disruptive manner. We have no confidence in the franchise owners, and believe parents should know about their history before deciding to enrol.  Ultimately, while the teachers are good and committed, the preschool management is not child-centric. Here is a final example: MindChamps Thomson scheduled the K2 graduation concert on 3 December, obviously to get parents to pay for that month‚Äôs enrolment. Several families planned to travel in Dec to visit family overseas etc and thus appealed to have the concert earlier. However, the management rejected the appeal. As a result, several children were not allowed to join the graduation concert, even if their parents were willing to pay the $373 concert/graduation package. This is simply mean and profit-obsessed. Most other preschools hold their graduation concerts in November, and even October.  We think teachers, parents and children deserve much better., My wife and I couldn't be happier with our experience at Thomson MindChamps Chinese Preschool! Our first born has been attending for several months now, and we have been consistently impressed with the quality of care and education provided. The teachers are all incredibly dedicated, knowledgeable, and patient, and they truly go above and beyond to make sure every child is thriving. Our child has learned so much during their time at the preschool, from Mandarin language skills to socialization and problem-solving skills. We also appreciate the emphasis on play-based learning and hands-on activities. The facilities are clean, bright, and well-equipped, and the communication with parents is excellent. Overall, we would highly recommend Thomson Chinese Preschool to any parent looking for a nurturing, enriching, and fun environment for their child's early education., I wanted what is best for my first born that this why I never hesitate to bring him to MindChamps. I have heard a lot of positive reviews about this center and I wanted to see for my self. Facilities are indeed child friendly and conducive for learning.  They have this systematic scheme that the child would be learning and enjoying because they thought that they were only playing. Teachers are also fun loving too. My child really enjoys to follow what his teacher sings and dances. That is worth of every dollar I spend., Kids learn faster than adults and, being 50% Chinese, I believe it is essential that our children be exposed to the Chinese culture and language early on. This will enable them to tap into the advantages of being proficient in one of the most widely spoken languages in the world today.  We were concerned initially whether our child would feel overwhelmed being thrown into a new environment with a new language. However, young children adapt quickly and before we knew it, he started acquiring new vocabulary and was responsive when I communicated with him in Mandarin.  Since he started attending school at MindChamps Chinese PreSchool @ Thomson, he learned many words, both in Mandarin and English. He can converse with a basic level of understanding and enjoys the songs and stories in both languages.

MindChamps Chinese PreSchool @ Thomson,"Kids learn faster than adults and, being 50% Chinese, I believe it is essential that our children be exposed to the Chinese culture and language early on. This will enable them to tap into the advantages of being proficient in one of the most widely spoken languages in the world today. We were concerned initially whether our child would feel overwhelmed being thrown into a new environment with a new language. However, young children adapt quickly and before we knew it, he started acquiring new vocabulary and was responsive when I communicated with him in Mandarin. Since he started attending school at MindChamps Chinese PreSchool @ Thomson, he learned many words, both in Mandarin and English.

I completed all required forms and waited for my daughter's class to begin in less than two months. However, about two to three weeks after registration, I received a call informing me of a fee increase. The staff told me that if I do not agree with the increment, I can choose to withdraw and they will refund fully. But this was not what I was initially told during sign-up. I'm aware that I'm not the only parent affected by this. MindChamps did not honor their promise, and the principal unashamedly mentioned a clause that is ‚Äòallowing them to change terms and conditions without notice‚Äô, which left me stunned. Their sales tactic was to lock in a special 12-month fee promotion during the special registration period. I find MindChamps Singapore's actions disappointing and unacceptable. But anyway, thanks to their management, this turned out to be a blessing in disguise for us. I'm extremely relieved that my child is not part of this school.

We would like to highlight their strength and give thanks to teachers of N2 for the effort that they have put forth this year. Teacher Liza ============= This year we manage to see Teacher Liza on a more prominent role as the N2 English teacher. As parents we are very happy on how she manages the class. She is firm when needed, as N2 class is more discipline and in order when going on excursion and also gentle when students needed her. As our daughter easily get bored and learn fast on certain situation, Teacher Liza will at times teach her some new songs and also learn basic math calculation while waiting for the kids' turn to go to the toilet, making learning fun by using elements around the environment. From my understanding it is not part of the curriculum at the point of time, and we are much appreciated that Teacher Liza have taken the initiative to do so, to keep our daughter engaging and make learning fun for her. our daugther will always come home waiting to learn to count more stuff and even teach us parents new songs. At time Teacher Liza has try to follow up on how daugther is doing at home to understand our daugther character more in dept. We truely appreciate her effort and care for our daughter. Yu Liaoshi =========== Last year we were really impressed with Yu Liaoshi. And this year is no different. We truly appreciate Yu Liaoshi patient for teaching our daughter Chinese. Our daugther will come home excited to tell us all the beautiful Chinese words to practise and dance. Coming from a non-chinnese speaking family, at times it is very hard to follow up with our daugther's Chinese language. Yu Liaoshi have been very helpful explaining to us parents on what our daugther have learn in school and also show us books during previous PTC on our daugther favourite Chinese book in class and share abit about the book story. As parents we love to follow up with our daugther after school and Yu Liaoshi have gone her way to write down the han-yu pi-yin on the home activities for Syafiqah, making it possible for us to do so. We truely appreciate that she have gone out of her way to assist us and be very patient on teaching our daughter. N2 Teachers ============ For the past 2 years, our daughter had to deal with teacher from her class leaving the school. And at times we are worried for our daughter development as she could get very attached to a teacher one day and suddenly her favourite teacher leaving the other day. We are very happy that Teacher Liza and Yu Liaoshi have been around for the whole of this year to guide our daugther development. Both of them are excellence teachers and work in sync with each other. Making our experience with the school engaging, interactive and worry free as we know our daugther is in good hands. As parents we would love to see both Teacher Liza and Yu Liaoshi be guiding our daugther through K1, as some of her friends (Best friends included) will be leaving school for MOE kindergarten next year. And having both Teacher Liza and Yu Liaoshi will really help our daugther go true these hard times. School Development =================== This year we saw much of the school rebranding and we parents really welcome and appreciate the school effort to make things easy for us parents and teachers. There were bugs in the school app in the beginning, which was expected for any new software. At times bugs like not receiving app notification, not receiving invoices and etc happen and the school principle and teachers have been very helpful in relaying information to parents, to bridge in the gap.

Cherie Hearts @ Charlton Pte Ltd,"Hi, my son attended this childcare many years back however I remembered it vividly. I was told the incidents of HFMD was minimal however the exact month my son was there, he was down with HFMD, and on the 3rd month too. During one incident when he was down with fever, the teacher locked him up in the room on L2 till dismissal (when they should have just called us to pick him up earlier). Few months later, we observed bruise marks on his arms on a few occasions. The principal and teacher said it‚Äôs due to ‚Äúplay with other students‚Äù. After so many unpleasant incidents, we decided to forego the deposit and take my boy out from Cherie Hearts at Charlton. How would we even want to continue that last month (after reporting these unpleasant incidents to the principal and teacher)? These kind of experiences can leave scars on children for years! In fact, they even leave psychological scars / guilt on parents - I‚Äôll think why I gave this childcare centre so many chances? What else happened to my kid (prior to my discovery?). Could all these be avoided if only I trusted my gut feel, (as well as granny‚Äôs observation outside the centre) and take him out earlier? Am so glad nowadays, the policing of childcare sector is more stringent. There‚Äôs definitely a lot of improvements in the childcare space! Why I‚Äôm sharing this review is because of a Straits Times article today about similar incident which happened to a 3yr old boy, (which ignited the bad memories).

It was a fabulous trip where a lot of places visited have provided a lot of learning opportunities and eye-opening live experiences to our son. Big thanks to Ms Brands who have organized this very well. I give it an Overall 9.0 / 10. The missing 1.0 point is for the following improvement : (1) 0.5 point - Red-Eye Flights (to-and-fro), while saving costs, but maybe a bit tough for young kid. Don't mind spending additional 2 days to travel with the normal day-time flight. (2) 0.5 point - The Osaka Zoo can be replaced by the Tokyo Ueno Zoo which is much bigger and more interesting.

All the teachers there were very friendly and taught me lots of interesting stuff, like drawing, simple mathematics, etc. I remembered there was even a once-a-week water play, where we mass around with water and throw water bombs around. Can't remember what's it called. But that was fun! I remember there was even an overseas trip together with the teachers to JB where we spent one night at LegoLand. That was a very memorable trip for me. I was there for 5 years and I truly enjoyed my time there.
