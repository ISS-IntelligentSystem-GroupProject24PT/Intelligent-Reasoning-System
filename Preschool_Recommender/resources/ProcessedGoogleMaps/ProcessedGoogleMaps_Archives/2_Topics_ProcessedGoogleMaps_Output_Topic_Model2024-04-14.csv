"""Deciding to send our kid to MindSpace @ Tai Seng, Grantral Mall was a game-changer; we were glad we made that decision. The dedication and hard work put in by the center managers and trainers is nothing short of remarkable. From coaching the kids to managing the center's operations, planning events, and keeping us informed about our child's progress, they handle it all with such finesse, it's like watching a well-oiled machine in action. Before MindSpace, our child seemed to exhibit learning challenges and behavioral hurdles: throwing tantrums when asked to do home work, unable to comprehend basic arithmetic, and disliking classes. We were pleasantly surprised that after going to MindSpace, he is actually looking forward to attend MindSpace. His attitude towards homework has improved, and he is showing significant improvement in behaviour. We were happy when the school teachers told us that they noticed an improvement with our child. It's got me thinking-if MindSpace can work wonders for our child, maybe they have a secret recipe for adults too. MindSpace, any chance of an adult program? Sign me up; I'm ready to experience that transformation firsthand!",0.09313725490196079,Topic 1,"['teacher', 'school', 'child', 'kid', 'care', 'principal', 'good', 'son', 'time', 'parent', 'centre', 'day', 'go', 'thank', 'year', 'love', 'like', 'daughter', 'month', 'take']",MindSpace @ Tai Seng (Grantral Mall) | After School Student Care for P1-P5 | MindChamps Enrichment for P1-P5

"Sending my niece to Mindspace@Tai Seng is the best education decision I have made! My niece (a typical heartlander) became more interactive, can articulate and express herself better. When I run into logistics coordination problems, the business owner, Ching & her team staff helped me with sincere and stress-free assistance with great initiative. It had helped me in dual capacity as in improving both education where I can focus on work concentration.

"I chanced upon this after school student care through a leaflet sent in my mailbox. Initially, I did not think very much about it till I met my sister who then just recovered from a nasty episode of COVID. I could see that she was definitely not as fit as before and on top of that, she shared that her grandson is attending several after school enrichment programmes in the week. Being the day carer for this boy, she has to make multiple trips per day. There I was looking at the leaflet for the second time that week and realised that this could solve some of the issues my sister was facing. I called up the centre and expressed my concern on behalf of my sister and Ms Ching Ching has been very attentive and empathetic of our situation. She assured me that her centre is able to help us overcome the challenges that we are facing. We attended the open house last December and we liked the place as the setup of the centre is conducive, is bright and the layout is fairly spacious. Everything in there are new as we understand the centre is at its start-up phase and most importantly, it is very convenient for us either by MRT or bus. Without much hesitation, we signed him up and since then, we have been in touch with the trainers, who are also very responsive with our queries and concerns on the day to day basis. The trainers update us frequently on his learning, behaviour as well as suggestions for areas of improvement which we can work with him at home. Due to the close working relationship between the trainers and us, we do see a significantly improvement in his social skills and his academic achievements. I did notice that he is now willing to work with a more challenging peer in this small group setting which otherwise he would avoid even being near to them in a school setting. This value is definitely very well inculcated and many thanks to the trainers in this centre who constantly remind them about peer inclusion and showing empathy towards others. Lastly, we really appreciated the variety of the lunch menu and the quality of the food. The picky eater (my grand nephew) is now open to eating out of his comfort zone. This is definitely a bonus for him and us. To date, we are pleased with his development and we will continue to work with the trainers for the betterment of him.",0.18973581973581974,Topic 1,"['teacher', 'school', 'child', 'kid', 'care', 'principal', 'good', 'son', 'time', 'parent', 'centre', 'day', 'go', 'thank', 'year', 'love', 'like', 'daughter', 'month', 'take']",MindSpace @ Tai Seng (Grantral Mall) | After School Student Care for P1-P5 | MindChamps Enrichment for P1-P5

"Curriculum The MindChamps curriculum and values are unmatched, from day 1 of enrolment, the Mindchamps team addresses your champ by name, and in time to come, my kid addresses each and every one of his subject teacher by name, mutual respect at a young age! Location One of the rare locations in the city where you can literally drop off your kid at the driveway and walk 5 metres to the school, no need to rush into carparks and basements, drop off and pick up is a 1 minute affair, not to mention the MindChamps team makes the effort to recognise your vehicle so your kid is ready to go the moment you walk up to the door, never had to wait longer than a couple of minutes. City Campus The centre lacks an inhouse indoor playground but they do make use of Marina square's public playgrounds for the kids to enjoy themselves, a hidden benefit - my kid seldom goes goo-goo over indoor playgrounds anymore as he does it on school time anyway, and getting him to leave one is easy, the school has conditioned him well. Talk about raising a city kid! Staff Hospitality I recall the first time we visited the centre in the morning, most of the kids were running into the school, and it's with no surprise, there's always a very warm welcome at the door greeting every kid good morning as they get ready through the health checks before school, so they get all hyped up about school the moment they step through the doors. Chinese Education There is a dedicated chinese lessons and teacher for every level, for a family that speaks only English at home, my kid picked up a remarkable amount of Chinese words for his age. Summary A famous chinese proverb goes ""三岁定八十"", if you're looking for a place for your kid to develop with the right values, principles and literal/motor competency, I'll bet my last nickel with the folks here at Marina MindChamps. Update: My sister saw the development in my kid and registered both her elder daughter in the Mindspace program and transfered her younger daughter to a Mindchamps near her place, kudos to the MindChamps team!",0.23554029304029306,Topic 0,"['teacher', 'child', 'school', 'kid', 'love', 'parent', 'staff', 'thank', 'environment', 'learn', 'care', 'good', 'ms', 'preschool', 'nurture', 'experience', 'activity', 'daughter', 'fun', 'provide']",MindChamps Performing Arts PreSchool @ Marina Square

"""My son has been in MindChamps since he was 20 months old but transferred to MindChamps Sengkang in June 2023 when he was in N2 because he didn't seem to enjoy his last centre as much as I had hoped he would. Transferring him here was the best decision I've ever made. The teachers in this school are outstanding in every way - they are a truly passionate, nurturing group of educators who love what they do and the children that they teach. And this love is quite evidently reciprocated by the students, who can't seem to get enough of school! My son longs to return to school even on weekends. Thank you for making school a very happy place to be at, as it should be. :) Shout out to Ms Hepzi, Ji Laoshi, Ms Ross, Mr Jeremy, Ms Anne, Ms Amenda and Ms Sharlene for always being so warm and attentive. If you're looking for a preschool that not only excels in its curriculum but provides a safe, nurturing and genuinely compassionate environment, look no further.

"My kid is usually slow to warm up in schools. He appeared very comfortable with the teachers and school in just 3 weeks. The things he learnt is in 6months is way much more than the 7 months he was in the previous school. I believe that school is not just about phonics, language, math and words, but also about knowledge around the world. He often comes back sharing about what he learns and some happenings in school. This is something which was not observed in previous schools. All these attribute to the committed teachers. They genuinely want to know more about the kid and make the effort to engage the kids. The support and nurturing environment is definitely one of the factors that allow him to open up faster. They help the kids to excel further in their strengths while encouraging them to work on their weaknesses. The curriculum in the school emphasises all aspects of development. The kids also get some exposure to performances that helps to build up their confidence. I love the open communication with the teachers. The teachers are very approachable and we do get regular updates about their progress in school. No regrets in sending my kid to the school.

"In June, we enrolled our daughter at MindChamps, and the transformation we've witnessed in her has been truly remarkable. She now effortlessly manages her daily routines and eagerly looks forward to attending school each day. One of the aspects we appreciate the most is the thoughtfully designed curriculum. It caters to the holistic development of our child, addressing her social and emotional skills, which we hold in high regard. MindChamps excels in guiding her social behaviors and provides ample opportunities for her to shine in public settings. Under the leadership of the dynamic Principal, Ms. Amenda, MindChamps has organised community outreach events for the children to participate in. In a short period, our girl has been involved in events such as the ""Grand mall opening ceremony"" and the ""Mid-Autumn Festival performance."" The teaching staff at MindChamps is truly exceptional. Their dedication and professionalism shine through in every interaction. We would like to express our heartfelt gratitude to Ms. Lydia and Ji laoshi, our daughter's form teachers, for their unwavering patience and timely feedback, which have played a significant role in her growth. We also want to extend our appreciation to Ms. Chantille, our daughter's English program (MRW) teacher, for her guidance and support, which have enabled our girl to read English books fluently at her level. When it comes to Music, Mr. Jeremy has been a fantastic mentor, and our daughter now enjoys playing the violin and other instruments. Last but not least, a big thank you to Ms. Hepzi, who consistently adds a fun element to Nuro Move. Your contributions to our daughter's overall development are greatly appreciated. Every day, our daughter discovers something new at this preschool. It's the perfect environment for her to learn, explore, and flourish. In conclusion, we wholeheartedly recommend MindChamps @ Sengkang to other parents seeking a nurturing and comprehensive early learning experience for their children.

"We enrolled our boy into Mindchamps Sengkang when he was 18 months old. 2 months had past and he had shown significant improvements in his fine motor skills, ability to listen to instructions and gained more confidence in his speech. The engagement and support from staff and teachers is excellent. Aside from updates through the App, face-to-face conversations are genuine and teachers are extremely approachable. Through our observations and communication with the teachers, we can feel that they genuinely love children and want the best for them. We love the curriculum as well which is pretty comprehensive even for PG level children, where they get to explore the various themes in music, gym, gourmet lessons. It has been an overall positive experience for our family, where we now see our boy showing much more interest in communicating and responding with people.

"My experience with this preschool has been nothing short of exceptional, and I am beyond grateful for the positive impact it has had on my sons. When my older son first started at MindChamps, he never spoke a single word of Mandarin. However, with the incredible guidance of his Chinese teacher, Ji Lao Shi, he has opened up to the language in a way that I couldn't have imagined. It's truly remarkable to see how he has progressed and embraced Mandarin under Ji Lao Shi's care and instruction. One of the things I really love about this school is the extensive exposure it provides to children. My sons have had the opportunity to explore various interests, including learning musical instruments like the violin at such a tender age. They even had the chance to perform at a public venue, and I could see how much they enjoyed the experience. It's heartwarming to witness their enthusiasm for learning and self-expression. The teachers at MindChamps, especially Ji Lao Shi, Miss Lydia, Miss Chantille, Miss Joy, Li Lao Shi, and Ling Lao Shi, are exceptional. They played a pivotal role in easing both my sons' transition into the school. It's evident that they genuinely care and love my children, which, as a parent, is what matters most to me. The support and nurturing environment they provide make all the difference. I must also commend the principal, Miss Amenda, for her attentiveness towards parent feedback. It's truly amazing to have a principal who values and listens to parents' opinions and concerns. Academically and holistically, my sons have shown significant improvement since joining MindChamps Preschool Sengkang. I wholeheartedly recommend this preschool to other parents seeking a nurturing and enriching environment for their children. It's been an incredible journey, and I am excited to see how my sons continue to thrive at this wonderful institution.

"In the blink of an eye, my 5-year-old sister has been attending mindchamps@Seng Kang for more than three months.

Occasionally, she would make superfluous remarks in the conversation, play the piano to an ox; or take out a Level 4 Oxford tree and relish it in the corner. When reading, the old mother felt really happy. After all, every parent hopes that their children can develop a good habit of independent learning as they grow up, and have a happy and splendid childhood.

The Teachers can be both firm and fun-loving (depending on what the occasion calls for). The kids love their Teachers! Bearing testament to this was how the children spontaneously hugged their teacher as she ushered them down the stage at the year-end concert!

The guidance，patience，and unwavering support have played an instrumental role in her growth. Your creative teaching methods，warm smiles and encouragement will be etched in her heart. You’ve not only taught her lessons from books but also lessons about kindness，respect and the journey of expiration. To her dear classmates，each of you has been a source of joy and inspiration. From shared laughter and adventures，you‘ve made her everyday at school unforgettable. The bonds you have formed are special，and I am grateful for the friendship that have taken root during your time together. I want to express my heartfelt gratitude to all of you. The memories created will always be cherished，and the lessons learned will continue to guide her.

As such, we are often anxious and always skeptical, if any school can guide her well. The Teachers have been very kind and supportive. We can always see improvements in her languages, behavior and social attitudes. She often gives us surprises, for example, keeps her own toys, asked for permissions to do certain things, know how to be kind or apologize when something goes wrong, speak proper sentences, able to share her toys and food etc On top of that, the school activities also help her to further develop the mind, writing her very first alphabet and initiate to sit at one corner to flip the books and using her little fingers to go through all the sentences. We did not imagine our active child who just turned 3-year-old, is capable to do all these by herself. We look forward for more of her good character being build up in this school.

Both my children are here from PG to K2 and never once do we have to worry if they would be mistreated or whatsoever at school because the teachers here are experienced and delicated. The outdoor playground is huge and there is water play from time to time. Both my children started off shy and reserved but the teachers managed to help them build up their confidence till they moved on to Primary school as confident individuals. We are so grateful to the teachers here who helped us mound their character so well. They learnt responsibilities, to care and to share. Most importantly, both built up a deep love for attending school, they both were happy and loves attending MindChamps to the extent that they just wish they can turn back time and stay on as babies. Thank you, MindChamps East Coast (OneKm - Kinex).",0.35833333333333334,Topic 0,"['teacher', 'child', 'school', 'kid', 'love', 'parent', 'staff', 'thank', 'environment', 'learn', 'care', 'good', 'ms', 'preschool', 'nurture', 'experience', 'activity', 'daughter', 'fun', 'provide']",MindChamps PreSchool @ East Coast
"Both my kids are with mindchamps@onekm. What makes the school special is that it has a strong sense of family. The bigger kids would help the little ones and they have friends across levels. The main teachers are also with the school for a long time. Been with the school for the past 5 years, we have become friends with the teachers and some of them taught both my kids. The kids are not only well prepared for p1, they are also exposed to current affairs and values (eg. The recent Thai cave incident was discussed in class).

"Our children (K2 and N1) are with Mindchamps Preschool @OneKM, or Kinexis, both started at 1.5yrs. They loved every bit of it and looked forward to school every morning, as they never complained about having to attend school. We've seen how well they progressed over the years and we are very pleased to have made this wise choice. We'd highly recommend Mindchamps Preschool to parents who prefer a more holistic approach to teaching and learning. This is particularly important to nurture lifelong interest in learning and to help my children cope with the world ahead of them. Besides, we are also happy with the activities-filled curiculum, perhaps that is the reason why our kids were often entusiatics learning new things. The teachers are always helpful, patient, kind and cheerful, which never failed to amaze us with their passion and dedication to their job. Kudos to the Principal Mrs Koh who did a fantastic job! Definitely a big thumbs up for them and should no.3 come along, we wouldn't hesitate but stick to Mindchamps!

"We enrolled our son with Mindchamps Kinex during the circuit breaker through a friend’s recommendation and we never looked back. We were apprehensive initially because of the timing that we enrolled our son, but that quickly dissipated. The school took social distancing and personal hygiene very seriously, requiring the children to wash their hands frequently. They even specially sourced a face shield for them. Pre-covid days, the parents were able to sit in with their child during the first week of school for a smooth transition. This was something we couldn’t do. Rachel understood our anxieties and for the first week, she attached Miss Pearlyn with our son to slowly warm him up to the environment and they gave us constant updates to assure us. Rachel and her whole team of teachers are very loving, passionate, dedicated and nurturing. Every single teacher regardless of the level that they were in charged of, were familiar with every child in Kinex from PG to K2. The feeling they gave us was that the entire school was one big happy family. All the teachers there have been teaching there for a considerable number of years. Attrition rate is low and they have a great seamless system and clockwork going on. This has to be attributed to Rachel’s strong leadership. No child or parent gets left behind. They were there every step of the way with us right from the start, responding to our many queries, allaying our fears and making sure our child and every child gets to fulfill their best potential in their time. They were there to encourage them when needed, yet being firm with him and rewarding him when he does something positive. Besides focusing on the curriculum, Rachel and the teachers also made sure the childrens’ social skills and inculcation of values were not missed out on either. Those to us were more important than the curriculum itself. We did not have to worry one bit putting our son with Mindchamps Kinex whilst working. We know that he was in the best hands. It was very sad and heartbreaking that we had to leave kinex for another branch because we relocated to the other end of the island. We have Rachel and her stellar team to thank for setting such a good foundation in our child that he transited well in the new school. I cannot thank especially Rachel, Miss Neesha, Miss Anna, Miss Pearlyn, feng lao shi, Miss Camille enough. Thank you all girls for all the heart work that you do. ❤️",0.22030129870129866,Topic 1,"['teacher', 'school', 'child', 'kid', 'care', 'principal', 'good', 'son', 'time', 'parent', 'centre', 'day', 'go', 'thank', 'year', 'love', 'like', 'daughter', 'month', 'take']",MindChamps PreSchool @ East Coast

For engaging children with little interaction with Chinese at home) 2. Safe Environment - how they handle misbehaviour, cleaning and sanitisation, and separate bathroom for boys and girls to protect their modesty from young. 3. Holistic education - Not just academic focused but overall exposure to different learnings at their young age (eg. Gym class, confidence in speaking in front of peers, simple cookery class, artwork, playtime in playground, music etc) 4. No homework for parents except for K2 (spelling only).

Specifically I’m very please with the amount of mandarin he is speaking because the exposure to mandarin at home is very limited . The school also does a very good job in communication and sharing the day to day activities with parents. Teachers will regularly send photos of my son at school to let me know what he is doing and how he is doing . There are also a lot of programs planned out for the children to ensure that they developed into all rounded kids . I will definitely recommend the school .,0.21921428571428572,Topic 1,"['teacher', 'school', 'child', 'kid', 'care', 'principal', 'good', 'son', 'time', 'parent', 'centre', 'day', 'go', 'thank', 'year', 'love', 'like', 'daughter', 'month', 'take']",MindChamps PreSchool @ City Square Mall

"I want to share my experience for the past few months with MindChamps Paragon. Some background of my son, who is turning five this year. He has been attending an International school in Brunei since he was two and a half years old before returning to Singapore on the 31st of November. The school with huge compounds, three canteens, excellent facilities, and large playgrounds, even just for kindergarten level. When he was in the international school, he was neutral, neither eager nor enthusiastic about school. During covid lockdown, he didn’t care whether he would be going to school the next day or not. After returning, I decided to enroll my son in Mindchamp Paragon. At first, I wasn’t very optimistic due to the limited area to play compared to the international school in Brunei. But this is what it is when we are in a scarce land city-state. As I would like my son to master his mandarin better, at home, we are only allowed to converse in mandarin as I would want my son to master at least in his mandarin speaking. During the enrolment, I specifically emphasized to the Teachers to encourage my son to speak more mandarin to him instead of English. To my surprise! After the first day of school, my son loves going back to MindChamps Paragon. Every day, even on weekends, without fail, he will ask me if there’s school tomorrow. He had shown so much interest in going to school that he did not have that enthusiasm in his previous school. After the first week of attending Mindchamps paragon, he has improved his mandarin speaking. In the following weeks, my son has shown significant improvements in his eagerness to write and draw, which he has lack of previously. Besides, the teachers went above and beyond to ensure the children were comfortable and well taken care of. This is the first time I have seen such a high level of dedication by the teachers, especially Fan Laoshi, Ms. Cammy, and Ms. Lee. After a long absence from lockdown, when school reopens, toddlers will typically take about a week to accept and adjust to new environments and routines. What took my son a week in the previous school, in mindchamps paragon, only one day. To my surprise, he was eager to go back to school the following day without the first day crying drama or pleading to go home, etc. It’s such a pity that we will be relocating again in the coming month. If it weren’t for relocating, we would be glad to continue with mindchamps paragon as long as the highest level mindchamps provides... My son and I are going to miss this excellent school!

"How to begin .. I can honestly say that we ( me and my son ) both miss Mindchamps very much. Liam practically grew up with this preschool since he was before 2 years old. From PG to K1 .. We appreciate the attentiveness that most of the Teachers give to the Champs professionally and the time they took to brief us every single day during pick up time. Some teachers would do the extra miles to attend to champs with special needs and to be able to understand that each house hold is different. Their roles at school were as equally important as mom’s roles at home, they are giving knowledge and implanting discipline that sometimes parents failed to do at home. We are VERY grateful for the Teachers. I apologize if I missed some names but I honestly hope that it won’t affect any of their good dedications and caring, from Miss Eunice, Wu Laoshi, Fan Laoshi, Miss Bev, Miss Cam, Ms Cleris, Ms Nadia, Ms Jasmine, Mr Jay .. even the previous Ah Yis who used to work there at PRG. I hope the COMPANY can further notice all of Teachers contributions and dedications to the children, can appreciate and care for the Teachers as well, since they play the most important roles in the school ( brand ) development and champs qualities.

"I can still remember the time when I was trying to find the best preschool in Singapore for my then two-year-old boy. I visited a few schools, but none could beat the “This is the right one” feel of MindChamps PreSchool at Paragon. The school was brimming with positivity and light. Children wore big smiles on their faces, greeting their friends, teachers and even schoolmates’ parents; teachers were warm and energetic, and the ambience was bright and colourful. They had me at ‘hello’. Within a year in MindChamps, he is not only speaking in full sentences but spewing out bombastic words that I’ve never heard of in my life. When asked what he likes best about his school, his response is, “My friends and teachers”. I think he doesn’t know how to say it yet, but I believe it’s more than just these two fundamental reasons for him liking school. I think to him, schooling in MindChamps is like an adventure or a journey to exciting discoveries. My husband and I too, are very fond of MindChamps.

The curriculum is good but the environment is not so homely and lack of personal touch. My daughter was absent for many days and hospitalised but there wasn’t a single call from school to check on her. I don’t see principal greeting students in the morning like what other kindergarten does. The checkers (normally not the teachers)will do health check with a serious face and normally doesn’t greet good morning to students. I personally feel the childcare was managed like an enterprise than a school. I have no doubt the curriculum is good but I do hope the environment can be more nurturing.,0.22043650793650796,Topic 1,"['teacher', 'school', 'child', 'kid', 'care', 'principal', 'good', 'son', 'time', 'parent', 'centre', 'day', 'go', 'thank', 'year', 'love', 'like', 'daughter', 'month', 'take']",MindChamps PreSchool @ Holland Village

"Sending my boy, Asher to MindChamps has been a great decision that both of us as parents have made. Mindchamps has been a great platform for Asher to develop in terms of cognitive and personality. Prior to sending Asher to Mindchamps, he was shy and quiet but Mindchamps has moulded him into an outgoing little boy after 3 years. Apart from that, he has developed into a boy who is observant and shows interest in many things that are around him that has also helped in turning him into a more outgoing person. His frequent questions and enquiries on his surroundings have also contributed to his creative mind because Mindchamps has provided many opportunities for Asher to grow up at his own pace but not forgetting to assist him step outside his comfort zone. In term of cognitive development, Asher has enhanced in language skills especially in English when he learned a lot of vocabulary, syntax and communicative skills through the well-designed syllabus that Mindchamps has developed for the kids. Most importantly, Asher is not a great user of Mandarin but his Mandarin has improved tremendously for the past years, allowing him to be able to communicate more effectively with others. Asher always compliments and enjoys the story telling sessions by the teachers in Mindchamps and he always comes back home telling us what he has learned from the story telling sessions. Sharing has not been his strength but Mindchamps makes him a better one and also builds him to be a conscientious person plus an all-rounder. We are looking forward to see more greatness in him as he progresses to K2.",0.2591049382716049,Topic 0,"['teacher', 'child', 'school', 'kid', 'love', 'parent', 'staff', 'thank', 'environment', 'learn', 'care', 'good', 'ms', 'preschool', 'nurture', 'experience', 'activity', 'daughter', 'fun', 'provide']",MindChamps PreSchool @ Holland Village

"Time flies so fast. In the blink of an eye, this is already Jiayi’s last year at Mindchamps. In more than four years, she has grown from a babbling baby to a lively and cheerful girl. School has a great attraction for her. Every morning when she wakes up, she wants to go to school as soon as possible. When she picks her up every day, she ""complains"" about why her mother comes so early and she is reluctant to go home. Fortunately, every teacher at school gave her enough patience and tolerance, and helped her grow better in her study and life. When Jiayi comes back, she often talks about the gentle and patient Mother Zhou, the cheerful and enthusiastic Miss YuSing, the serious and responsible Ji Laoshi, the meticulous Teacher Frances, the humorous Teacher Klement, the talented Teacher Hui Sin, the story-telling Teacher Jasmine... too many The teacher helped her become a better version of herself. Jiayi is a child with a lot of personality, and her thinking is relatively mature. She often shares her anecdotes at school with us like a little adult, and often borrows the words of teachers or parents to argue with us. She likes to ask more and more ""why"" when it comes to learning. She likes to read books, listen to stories, and share the knowledge she learned in school. When getting along with her friends, she likes to share every detail of life with the children, and she also learns to be polite and humble and actively help others. In life, she is a veritable ""little housekeeper"". While doing her own thing well, she also worries about all the things around her. Sometimes she often brings us unexpected surprises. She likes the study tour activities organized by the school, which can help her broaden her horizons and increase her knowledge. We are very happy to see Jiayi’s growth, and we are very grateful to the school and teachers for their efforts. We also hope that she can better enrich herself in the remaining time. Kindergarten is her first step in contacting the society. We are very happy and Let’s work together with Mindchamps to describe her best moments and leave her with the most unforgettable memories!""",0.3286174242424242,Topic 1,"['teacher', 'school', 'child', 'kid', 'care', 'principal', 'good', 'son', 'time', 'parent', 'centre', 'day', 'go', 'thank', 'year', 'love', 'like', 'daughter', 'month', 'take']",MindChamps PreSchool @ Holland Village

"My daughter (now in K1) has been at this school since playgroup and my son just started playgroup this year. Enrolling my son was an easy decision seeing how my daughter has blossomed over the years at mindchamps. The smaller class sizes ensure that students get personalised attention from teachers, who are truly invested in their learning. Lessons, while conducted within the theme/topic for the term, are nonetheless adjusted to the children’s interests, ensuring that the children remain excited to keep on learning. Indeed, the teachers make mindchamps special. It is clear from conversations with them that they are extremely dedicated to their craft and caring for the children, not just the children in the class they teach but the children across all levels. My son’s current teacher, who also taught my daughter in her nursery years, still interacts with my daughter regularly and provides me with feedback. My daughter’s teachers are also constantly looking out for my son and providing me with updates on how he is adjusting to school. I’m ever grateful and thankful to my mindchamps village for providing such a safe and loving environment for my children to learn and grow.

"This preschool has inept, unresponsive franchise owners, whose poor management has caused high staff turnover and distrust from many parents. Our child was with MindChamps Thomson Chinese Preschool for K1 and K2, graduating in 2023. We chose this school as we wanted a Mandarin-immersion programme near our home. While our child had good teachers throughout the two years there, unfortunately, the school was very poorly managed. During this period, 4 principals resigned (the 5th principal will be starting in late-Jan 2024), along with all 6 of our child’s teachers. What is worse is that these 6 teachers left with little to no notice period given to the parents or children. This is despite the management being aware that they resigned several months ahead of time. They deliberately required the teachers not to tell the parents, giving no time for a proper farewell and showing little regard for the relationship between the teachers and the children. The school environment was therefore very unstable, making it difficult for children to form a relationship of trust with their teachers. Just imagine how your child would feel if they started trusting a teacher, only to see her suddenly depart, time after time. During the first wave of resignations in 2022, we were among a group of 9 families who collectively wrote a letter to the franchise owners to express our grave concern. We were deeply dissatisfied with the high staff turnover and their decision to announce the teachers’ departure at very short notice (i.e. 1 day before her last day). Notably, the owners did not bother to respond to us at all. Instead, the new principal tried to assure us she would right the ship. She worked hard and seemed sincere, but soon resigned as well. While we certainly considered changing school, eventually we kept our child there because of the existing friendships and the new teachers were good. It’s also rather disruptive to change school with just a year to go. The K2 year was more stable – we thought the management had finally met minimal standards. Unfortunately, that was not to be the case. In mid-December 2023, both the K2 teachers left the school abruptly. Once again, the management kept the news from us until 3 days before the teachers’ final day. This was baffling, given that the parents had already paid the school fees for December, so they could have given more time to allow the children to process the end of these treasured relationships. From these actions, it is clear that the franchise owners of MindChamps Thomson are lacking in management and people skills. Worse, they do not listen to feedback. Principals did not stay more than 6 months, they could not explain the decisions of the franchise owners, and good teachers left very suddenly, in an unnecessarily disruptive manner. We have no confidence in the franchise owners, and believe parents should know about their history before deciding to enrol. Ultimately, while the teachers are good and committed, the preschool management is not child-centric. Here is a final example: MindChamps Thomson scheduled the K2 graduation concert on 3 December, obviously to get parents to pay for that month’s enrolment. Several families planned to travel in Dec to visit family overseas etc and thus appealed to have the concert earlier. However, the management rejected the appeal. As a result, several children were not allowed to join the graduation concert, even if their parents were willing to pay the $373 concert/graduation package. This is simply mean and profit-obsessed. Most other preschools hold their graduation concerts in November, and even October. We think teachers, parents and children deserve much better.",0.0693823831535696,Topic 1,"['teacher', 'school', 'child', 'kid', 'care', 'principal', 'good', 'son', 'time', 'parent', 'centre', 'day', 'go', 'thank', 'year', 'love', 'like', 'daughter', 'month', 'take']",MindChamps Chinese PreSchool @ Thomson

"Kids learn faster than adults and, being 50% Chinese, I believe it is essential that our children be exposed to the Chinese culture and language early on. This will enable them to tap into the advantages of being proficient in one of the most widely spoken languages in the world today.

However, young children adapt quickly and before we knew it, he started acquiring new vocabulary and was responsive when I communicated with him in Mandarin.

Kudos for the MC@Punggol Northshore teams! If there is any improvement that I can made comment of it, will be 1) I hope they will be more “parents and child day at school” on some special occasion such as festival celebration/ father’s or mother day’s celebration etc. (but to be fair we are only at MC for 3 mths, they might hv planned it on diff occasions) 2) More photo update to parents esp for younger age group as is hard to ask them how’s their days in sch due to their language aren’t fully forms yet.

"Our girl’s PG to K2 journey in MC Punggol is coming to an end this month and it has been an extremely enriching experience for her. We could see significant improvements in her behavior in the past 2 years and the MC Punggol team deserves a shoutout for it. Regular updates on our girl’s development from the app, parent-teacher meetings and quick 5-minute chats with teachers after school has been very helpful as it allows us to “continue” the learning with our child at home. Post-Covid, the school began to resume a lot of activities such as farm visits (crocodile, fish, goat, vegetable etc.), excursions (Changi Experience Studio), outdoor activities (Splash @ Kidz Amaze), Sports Day and cultural celebrations to make learning fun and enjoyable at the same time. As parents we also looked forward to taking part in some of these activities with our kids. The curriculum in my opinion is quite well-balanced and focuses on different areas of development. While preparation for Primary 1 is important, the champs also spend substantial time on learning various musical instruments (violin!), arts and crafts, cultural diversity and outdoor activities to stimulate development in other areas and build up their character. Our girl was fortunate to be taught by several wonderful and dedicated teachers who are always looking out for her. The principal Veron, form teachers Mr. Tze and 杨老师 constantly updated us on her meltdowns in school and this helped us greatly in correcting her behavioral issues. Mr. Tze's encouraging and motivating attitude is really ""contagious"" and we could see our girl being influenced positively by him. 柴老师, whom we know so well by now and possibly the active longest-serving teacher there, will personally watch over her whenever she has her bad days and calm her down. Jerome and Katherine have also been proactive in sharing feedback on our girl’s development in music and reading. Our boy who is in Nursery was assigned to the young and vibrant pair of 小恩 and Tiffany who could match his energy levels and we could feel their genuine attachment to the toddlers under them from their dedication and efforts towards the preparation for the Year-End Musical showcase. Location wise, the school may not be conveniently accessible but having its own little gym, library, and outdoor playground more than makes up for it. It can be quite a pain during wet weather as the walkway from the main road bus stop to the school is unsheltered. To sum it up, MC Punggol team really outdone themselves in making the 2 biggest events of the year, the Family Fiesta and the Year-End Musical, a great success. I believe a lot of parents were touched by the performances and proud of their champs. The hours spent on choreographing the dance, rehearsals, handmaking the costumes and props is a testament to the passion and dedication of the whole MC Punggol team under the leadership of Veron. We are really grateful to the teachers who will be departing the school after leading the champs through these milestones in their preschool journey and for the positive impact on them. I would not hesitate to recommend MC Punggol to parents who are looking for a preschool and willing to pay more for the higher education standards and conducive environment. PS: We were impressed by Sheryl's attentiveness to my dad's condition and for taking the initiative to change my parents' seats for the Musical.

"I speak from the experience of being a father of two who are attending Mindchamps Punggol Northshore, and this is my honest opinion of the establishment. Location wise it might not be the most convenient to some, but the environment and infrastructure together with real estate space more than makes up for it. I have been impressed by the general state of cleaniness and hygiene control of the school whenever I visit the place, and the seemingly much lower rates of HFMD/Influenza spreads within the school is probably a good tesitmony of that. While as with every establishment we cannot expect the quality of every single teacher to be of the highest standard of excellence, I have observed that generally most if not all of the staffs have displayed a good level of understanding with regards to how they should effectively carry themselves in various situations. It is clear that training is prioritized on a management level for that to be achieved (think Hai Di Lao, but for schools). A huge plus point is it's not uncommon to see staffs who are truly passionate about what they do and enjoy being surrounded by kids. Annoyance or irritation from the staff is an extremely rare sight if any. I am impressed by how most of the staff make the effort to know every child's name and even attempt to build rapport with each of everyone of them. It's comforting to know that there are multiple staffs and teachers who approach their work with their hearts daily. I do not think this would be possible without the likes of Ms Veron, Mr Jerome and Cai Laoshi (to name a few but there's more), who have definitely helped in creating a healthy culture and environment within the establishment for children to grow and shine in. I dare confidently say that most children who graduate from Mindchamps Punggol Northshore will enjoy a headstart in their primary school journey.

"I'm a parent of 2 kids who are currently in this branch for about 4 years and lucky to have found this branch for our kids. The branch has a strong curriculum and always has the kids' well-being as their priority. While there is a strong curriculum in place, they also teach based on the class's interest. This is important to sustain kids' curiosity in learning. For example for N1 classes learning about farm animals, The teachers will hold conversations with the kids and find out their interests. With this, class A would have a slightly different aspect from class B based on their kid's interests. With the opening up from covid situation, they have increased their excursions, such as theatre play, goat farm, crocodile farms as well! The kids enjoyed themselves a lot. The teachers are dedicated and always go above and beyond their primary responsibility. They always provide timely and valuable feedback on your kids and allow parents to know how they are in school, etc. The principal and admin staff are very responsive as well. All in all, I would say that this branch is indeed a flagship branch of mind champ where they have a good curriculum, good systems and processes, good teachers, and admin staff. Do note that not all mind champ branches are the same. After hearing about the experiences that my friends had with other branches. I'm lucky to have found this branch.",0.2946078431372549,Topic 0,"['teacher', 'child', 'school', 'kid', 'love', 'parent', 'staff', 'thank', 'environment', 'learn', 'care', 'good', 'ms', 'preschool', 'nurture', 'experience', 'activity', 'daughter', 'fun', 'provide']",MindChamps PreSchool @ Punggol

With so many choices of pre-school out there I was unsure which is the best for my daughter.

In addition to teaching the basic academic skills, the workshop explained how they build the children’s confidence to face these challenges.

"I'd like to affirm the good work that the teachers and staff have done, especially those mentioned below: Thank you foremost to my son's class teachers - Ms Siying, 李老师, and Ms Huihui. We as parents are well aware that handling a very active and restless child like my son isn't the easiest, but the teachers try their best and are transparent about how they manage and at times discipline him. My special thanks to 李老师 - her updates (through phonecalls and chats during pickup) are always very astute, sharp and insightful. It only goes to show she isn't just child minding - she is thoughtful about the children's behaviour and tries to interpret what they might mean. It means a lot to me that she takes the time to troubleshoot issues with me, and never once comes across as judgemental. This is so important to a parent. 2) Thank you to the enrichment teachers too - Mr Jerome, Ms Lash, and Ms Hanah. My son comes back telling me all sorts of things he's learnt — log rolling in gym class, takadimi rhythm in music class, and spheres (!) in literacy class. It's really funny and heartening at the same time. And he's only 3! 3) And lastly to everyone else - principal Ms Veron, admin staff and the other teachers : thank you for always being welcoming and smiley during drop off (even when us as parents are not! 😂). It makes a difference how kids are welcomed. Thank u Mindchamps Northshore :)",0.17750270562770562,Topic 1,"['teacher', 'school', 'child', 'kid', 'care', 'principal', 'good', 'son', 'time', 'parent', 'centre', 'day', 'go', 'thank', 'year', 'love', 'like', 'daughter', 'month', 'take']",MindChamps PreSchool @ Punggol

Mr Tze is an energetic and passionate teacher. He is creative and always goes above and beyond to ensure the champs enjoy learning! He has been spot on about my sons challenges despite it being very early into the year and we have tremendous trust that he will push our child to his highest potential.

"My son has been with Punggol Northshore Mindchamp for more than a year since he was 22 months old. What first made me chose this school is the curriculum of Mindchamp, the good reputation and the school’s cleanliness & environment. I am glad to have sent my boy to Mindchamp punggol because I observed how well-run this place is, passionate teachers and how well-thought lesson plans their have. 1. The teachers truly cares for the students through small little actions that I have observed. They are patience, caring and well-trained. My boy feels very comfortable with them. 2. What impresses me is that all teachers receiving and sending off the kids at the reception remember each and every student names! How attentive it is. 3. The principal, Ms Veron runs the school very well. She is hands-on, decisive, attentive, and approachable. She impresses me with how she handles every covid situation - transparent reporting, clear instruction and personally calling parents to follow-up. With her running the school, it gives me assurance.

"My daughter has been attending Mindchamps Punggol Northshore since she was 2 years old(PG). If you are looking for a school with comprehensive curriculum, this is the school that you can consider. The champs learnt and gained knowledge through enquiry learning, which I think it is a fun way of learning. Their focus is not only on academic wise, they also build the champs' character, self-esteem, emphasising on mannerism. There are always timely updates on latest cases on HFMD/Covid on teacher-parent apps, which is really assuring especially when they ensure deep cleaning is carried out each time.

Alongside the principal, she would not only call us to show concern when we are unable to send our child, with low immunity, to school, she would send us comprehensive notes of study and slides of the chinese classes missed to ensure our child is able to catch up with the syllabus. All these efforts spent despite her being heavily pregnant. Our English speaking child now sings Chinese songs, recites Chinese poems and is able to recognise and read Chinese words when back home from school.

"I had a negative experience with MindChamps. I registered, paid a deposit, and two months' fees to secure a promotional rate during registration. I completed all required forms and waited for my daughter's class to begin in less than two months. However, about two to three weeks after registration, I received a call informing me of a fee increase. The staff told me that if I do not agree with the increment, I can choose to withdraw and they will refund fully. But this was not what I was initially told during sign-up. I'm aware that I'm not the only parent affected by this. MindChamps did not honor their promise, and the principal unashamedly mentioned a clause that is ‘allowing them to change terms and conditions without notice’, which left me stunned. Their sales tactic was to lock in a special 12-month fee promotion during the special registration period. I find MindChamps Singapore's actions disappointing and unacceptable. But anyway, thanks to their management, this turned out to be a blessing in disguise for us. I'm extremely relieved that my child is not part of this school. I personally know a few music teachers working at MC. While I understand that personal lives should generally not be intertwined with one's profession as a teacher working there, I can't help but feel a great sense of relief that my child is not being taught or cared for by certain music teachers.",0.034837092731829576,Topic 1,"['teacher', 'school', 'child', 'kid', 'care', 'principal', 'good', 'son', 'time', 'parent', 'centre', 'day', 'go', 'thank', 'year', 'love', 'like', 'daughter', 'month', 'take']",MindChamps PreSchool @ Toa Payoh

"Sending my son to Mindchamps TPY preschool since Nursery. Very big spacious preschool with individual classrooms, activity rooms ,music room, gourmet room etc and mindscape indoor playground and more. My son picked up strong vocal skills and confidence and he writes his alphabets and numbers well even before turning 4. He recognizes simple words when reading. My son is able to wear his uniform ,socks and shoes independently too as he learned these skills in school with constant practice.. I like the fact that there is a good amount of both play and academics in Mindchamps curriculum (which is very important in this era). They have started going on outdoor learning journeys too after the COVID restrictions have been eased. And of course the friendly and caring teachers as well - Form teacher, Chinese Lao Shi and other enrichment teachers !!

Though there are no outdoor area within the school, there is a huge gym area for their lessons and there are also the monthly excursions for the child to explore and relate their classroom learnings to real life experience. The principal and administrative staff are also very accommodating and responsive to the needs of the parents. Besides the class teachers, the school principal also makes effort to speak to parents during drop off and pick up timings to strengthen the school and parents partnership in developing the child. With the positive development on my elder child, my younger child will also commence school at Mindchamp Buangkok shortly. Having seen and heard a lot of stories from my friends enrolling their child at other places, I’m confident to recommend that MC Buangkok is a place where you can enrol your child to with no regrets!",0.22757836990595615,Topic 0,"['teacher', 'child', 'school', 'kid', 'love', 'parent', 'staff', 'thank', 'environment', 'learn', 'care', 'good', 'ms', 'preschool', 'nurture', 'experience', 'activity', 'daughter', 'fun', 'provide']",MindChamps PreSchool @ Buangkok (Serangoon North)

"Our daughter commenced her journey at Mindchamps Buangkok (""MCBKK"") since N1 way back in early 2019. She participated and we just attended her K2 graduation ceremony 3 weeks back and she will be leaving Mindchamps as a confident and articulate ""K3"" to start her P1 formal education very shortly. During the course of the last 4 years, both my wife and I have much to thank the whole team at MCBKK principle, teachers and support staff. It is inevitable that there will always be turnover for any childcare though I know MCBKK will try their best to retain and replace. Kids are also more resilient than what most parents think and adapt quickly. Nonetheless as I reflect, would I have trusted my daughter with MCBKK all over again? The answer is a definite ""yes' for the following reasons. - Great partnership between parents and entire MCBKK team, bus driver and bus auntie included. - Genuine and professional teachers and staff who really care and bother - Clean, bright and cheerful environment - Holistic educational experience that covers English, Chinese, Math, reading, writing, physical education, art, gourmet, performance and music just to name some. - Honest and timely feedback from teachers - Supportive fellow parents and wonderful classmates Covid was a trying period for all of us and I could appreciate the amount of consideration, stress and work that went behind as the MCBKK team tried to maintain a safe and healthy environment for the kids while keeping up with their programme. Special mention Ms Ng, Ms Yun, Ms Shannon, Ms Mabel, Ms Beth, Ms Amanda, Ms Cass, Ms Fu, Ms Stella and ex-teachers Ms Eileen and Ms Zhang Qian. A big Thank You to all of you! All of you have been instrumental in one way or another for our child's growing up journey. We are always grateful and appreciative and definitely like to share our gratitude and experience with any parents who are currently in their taunting process of selecting a pre-school for their little ones. There is no perfect pre-school but only the most suitable one. For us, we are happy to have partnered MCBKK for our child's journey.

"After months of searching for a preschool for my daughter, I have finally found Mindchamps Buangkok to be our preferred choice in this neighborhood. Likely to be one of the best that offers an all-rounded curriculum and one with personalized feedback . We have seen a significant progression in our daughter's learning journey since she was transferred from another preschool at N1 last year. One example is that my daughter is able to recognise her name and write it independently now. Kudos to the dedicated team that Principal Shannon leads. Their parent-teacher communication is clear and also insightful in understanding our daughter's personal growth, which is helpful to her growth not only in school but also at home. The school also organizes monthly field trips that align with its curriculum, which is fantastic because the kids not only learn within a classroom setting but also experience it in a more practical setting. Special shout out to the teachers, Ms. Kym, Fu laoshi, Ren laoshi, Ms. Cass, and Ms. Beverley & supporting staff for making my daughter, Klary, preschool's journey a fulfilling one.",0.22388392857142858,Topic 0,"['teacher', 'child', 'school', 'kid', 'love', 'parent', 'staff', 'thank', 'environment', 'learn', 'care', 'good', 'ms', 'preschool', 'nurture', 'experience', 'activity', 'daughter', 'fun', 'provide']",MindChamps PreSchool @ Buangkok (Serangoon North)

"""The centre is well-managed - the management oftentime takes practical actions after receiving feedback on improvements, which impresses me. I like it that the Centre Directors Desmond and Stacey and their team partner with us parents closely in our children's development, and engage us with sincerity. My kids love their teachers (form teachers Ms Cheryl, Ms Mira, 江老师 and 岑老师, enrichment teachers Ms Nat, Ms Rina and Ms Bee, and ATs Ms Susan, Ms Arina, Ms Aman etc), and very often talk about them, their classmates and what they learnt. In terms of facilities and offerings, MC Bishan is also one of the firsts which introduced the music enrichment programmes, and provided indoor playground and water park, as well as a semi-outdoor garden. It has been 3 years since my eldest joined MC Bishan.
