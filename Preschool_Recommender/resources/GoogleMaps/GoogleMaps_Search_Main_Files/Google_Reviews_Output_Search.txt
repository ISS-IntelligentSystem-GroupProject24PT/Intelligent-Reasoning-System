MindChamps PreSchool @ The Brooks II,"We have had the pleasure of sending our child to MindChamps @ Brooks II since 1 year ago, and we couldn't be happier with the experience.  The teachers at MindChamps are exceptional. Their dedication, patience, and genuine care for each child create a nurturing environment where kids thrive. They not only educate but also foster emotional development and social skills in a way that goes above and beyond our expectations.  The curriculum is well-structured and engaging, tailored to meet the needs and interests of every child. We've been amazed at the progress our child has made, not just academically, but also in terms of creativity, independence, and confidence.  The facilities are clean, safe, and thoughtfully designed.  Communication with the staff is seamless. We've always felt welcome to ask questions, seek updates, or discuss any concerns we might have. The regular progress reports and parent-teacher meetings have been invaluable in understanding our child's development journey.  Special events and activities are frequent, and it's evident that the staff put a lot of effort into making each one memorable, be it birthday celebrations, themed dress-up days, field trips, or holiday celebrations. The school's management also went above and beyond to create a touching video montage for my child on his birthday. We're really thankful that our child loves school and has a great time at MindChamps., As a parent, I have carefully reviewed all the comments. I must objectively state that this school indeed has many issues, and I do not recommend parents to enroll their children here.  Firstly, there has been an excessively high turnover of teachers over the past two years. Except for a few senior staff members, the entire teaching staff leaves every year.  Secondly, due to the frequent turnover of teachers, children have a very hard time adapting to the school. This has led parents to lose confidence in the school.  In summary, this is not a trustworthy school, and in recent years, the school leadership has turned a blind eye to this. The teachers I have come into contact with who left were all highly professional and dedicated. I believe that if it weren't for the extremely poor working environment, no teacher would want to leave.  It is evident that the school leadership is not very friendly to its staff, which has resulted in poor school management., MindChamps PreSchool @ Brooks II has become my second home and I feel incredibly thankful to be a part of the team at this preschool. Our little ones are our top priority and we give our best every day to ensure they receive the love, attention, and education they deserve. It's truly fulfilling to see them blossom into confident and curious individuals., Teachers are incredibly caring and patience towards my son. My son enjoys going to sch and always happily mentioning about his teachers! Teachers often kept us updated as well! Kudos to Ms Poova, ÊûóËÄÅÂ∏à and Ms Priscilla!, The school's communications is so lousy. The teachers/admin always makes assumptions.  The teacher even told my daughter that she cannot go toilet. Saying ""sorry, too bad"". As they were late for some event. Don't expect the teachers to take complete care for your kid.  And the director is always missing when issues happens. BUT She will be always there take your registration fee for your kid.  The teachers keep changing too. Seriously. I don't know what is happening.  Register your kid at your own risk. You have been warned. Definitely complaining to HQ soon.  Updates: Seems the school director doesn't seems to care what has happened and mindchamp HQ is down playing the matter.  Lost of words...  Good luck to parents that still wish to still send their kids here., My daughter started attending her pre-school from PG till now N2. Teachers and stuffs have been guiding her well, and have always feedback to us about her behaviour and performance in school. Will definitely let my daughter stay till she finish her K2., The teachers are very caring for the kids and I can see my kids growing up and learning happily. Many events and celebrations are also held to make sure learning is a happy process for the kids. Thank you Mindchamps Brooks II for the pleasant experience!, My child has experienced five teacher changes within just eight months. It appears that the school's management team does not value their teachers, leading to a high turnover rate due to a poor working environment. Despite paying a significant amount in school fees, I feel disappointed with the quality of education and learning process that my child is receiving at this institution. Therefore, I strongly encourage parents to reconsider sending their children to this school., My son joined from PG and now N2 already. The teachers were very patient and nice to him. I'm so glad that he was taken care of and grow up happily., The boss/director of this preschool lacks effective management skills. There is a frequent turnover of teachers due to bad working conditions. I have concerns about the inadequate care my son receives. I am genuinely disappointed by this Mindchamps branch., Made a very good chance for sending my daughter to MindChamp right after she hit 18 months age. She gonna be promoted to K1 for 2024, and we are looking forward to her new journey with MindChamp., Management is now paying for bots to write good review? Look at all the 5 star reviews posted at the same time. Shady pre-school. Think twice before sending your precious child to this pre-school. Good teachers have all left., Joined MindChamps@BrooksII in 2019 and can't believe we are planning our 4th K2 graduation.     Consider myself blessed to be part of the team that weathered COVID together. Now, we have a new team but the outlook is optimistic because we put our Champs first in all things., The teachers go above and beyond to ensure that every child feels safe, valued, and engaged. It's evident that they genuinely care about each child's development and well-being., Darlene has just joined N2 Brooks this year. I was concerned if she would adapt well as her previous preschool was less academic and focused on playing. Growing up in an academic focused environment, I knew the importance of giving our children a head start in the right preschool and I am pleased to say that Darlene has improved tremendously in her writing, speech and (even) eating ability! I know she‚Äôs on good trajectory and will be ready for primary school by the time she graduates! Looking forward to send her younger siblings there too., My elder daughter had been in Mindchamps since July in K1, and she had been enjoying and looking forward to going school.  Despite this short few months that she just started, she had improved academically and become more independent. The teachers and staff are very helpful and keep us updated about her progress etc especially Ms Han. We had also enrolled our youngest for 2021 N1 and totally have no qualms having our two girls under the care and teaching by Mindchamps. Thank you, MindChamps., Must say, it was such a relief when my 3yo adapted into the school easily - just a month ago. I was filled with anxieties during my son's first few days in N1 - however was eased by the school teachers and the management. They sent me photos and updated on how my son was settling down. Phew! Such an ease. A fantastic team; great teachers and staffs. This is definitely a great placement. It's through my son's expressions that I see how much he loves to be at school. He is HAPPY child. After school he sings and shares some stories here and there. Thank you Mindchamps üòä, We are so thankful for Ms Linna and her faculty of amazing educators at Mindchamps @The Brooks for everything they do on a daily basis for our children. They are always warm and full of love, and it‚Äôs always assuring to know that our children are in good hands when in school because the Teachers keep in close contact with us and respond quickly to any concerns we may have. The centre is also big on being GREEN and eco friendly so you will see really creative displays done up by the Teachers using recycled materials in school. This is wonderful as it teaches our young ones not only about saving Gaia but also how we can be less wasteful and more creative! Truly an amazing team and we have nothing but great things to say about them. Can‚Äôt wait to start our younger one in PG next year!, A bright, well decorated centre, feels safe for young children. I will surely recommend to my family and friends, Dearest MC @ Brooks II staff,  A rose for everyone to start school! It has been a trying period and thank you for persevering!  Thank you especially to the teachers who had to bring their lessons online overnight as well as be there for limited services.  Thank you cleanliness captains for working extra hard to keep the school clean.  Thank you chef for looking after the children's diet.  Thank you all backend staff for coordinating and doing all the admin work.  Thank you everyone in MC Brooks II!  Love, Mr and Mrs Zhang, PG Teachers are caring and responsive. They are attentive to things that may seem insignificant yet important to us eg. my son's constipation. Teacher monitors the situation n mindfully gives the supplement. I like the padded gym where my son can jump and run without fear of being injured., Dedicated staff, clean and bright environment, a conducive school for young children., Good experience. Dedicated teachers and management team. My child enjoys going to school., Good study environment, highly recommended!"
MindChamps PreSchool @ Woodlands,"The signature show for the K2 graduation was truly impressive. It was evident how much passion and effort the teachers invested in the preparation of the show. I am deeply grateful for their dedication in nurturing our child with a champion mindset. Thank you so much!, Thank you for putting the curriculum showcase in such a short span of time. It exuded confidence from our little champs and showcased their amazing handicrafts.  I was able to see my toddler in a different light, thanks to your dedicated efforts.  Looking forward to future events! Good job planning committee üëç, Highly recommended to all. Kudos to their kind teachers, very engaging towards kids and parents. Kids learn new things every single day. The environment is very comfortable for kids and stress free for parent when you are out to work. üòçüòçüòç, Celebrated Cereal Day in school. Very well executed and had a great time with my son. The school is well run and the teachers are caring and attentive., Very creative and engaging session on the curriculum show case day., My boy experiences a very interactive and interesting learning experience. As a parent , we also have a nice experience with sport day event n show&tell event. Good job to the whole of teaching teams üëè. ‚Ä¶, All of the champs has done a great job. Awesome!! I can see all champs had fun, enjoy & build up their confident level. Good job Teachers!, I love the experience I've had with Mindchamps @ Woodlands. We've been with the school for about a year plus and I feel that the teachers and staff have been really thoughtful and loving towards my child. There's no issue with sending him to school and he adapted to the environment really quick. It speaks volumes about their level of care because my baby usually cries a lot with strangers when he was younger.  The teachers would also communicate closely with us parents to explore ways in which we can better my child's development and I am glad to know that the teachers do understand my child's temperament, development and habits really well. Thus, this has been reassuring to know that my child is in good hands of professionals who are experienced with dealing children as unique individuals.  I also love that the school's academic approach is dynamic, where teachings aren't confined to the classroom. I love how my child is able to communicate what he learned in school to me when I come home from work. More importantly, I do appreciate the occasional drops of photos through the Mindchamps app like the attached photos, where I get exclusive updates of their time in school.  I cannot thank the teachers enough for providing a loving and nurturing environment for the children. (:  extending my most heartfelt thanks, mother of Henry., Before choosing MindChamps, I visited other schools for comparison. Ultimately, I chose MindChamps Woodlands for several main reasons:  1:The school's core value is respecting children with zero intimidation. as a mother, this was my top priority. 2:The educational philosophy of the school's 10 core values attracted me. 3:MindChamps Woodlands is directly affiliated with the MindChamps headquarters. 4:The school environment is great, very comfortable, and clean. 5:The transparent curriculum planning and the careful selection of food for children made me feel more assured. Without hesitation, I chose MindChamps Woodlands. after my child started at this kindergarten, I felt reassured (i still rmb i was crying together with my son in the first few days to school.). The school's app updates on child's situations time to time daily. Most importantly, my child enjoys going to school. despite relocating (the new home being about an hour's drive from MindChamps Woodlands), we visited new MindChamps schools with the intent to transfer. However, my child firmly insists on staying at MindChamps Woodlands with their teachers and classmates. i always believe that the child's heart is pure, and I believe their choice follows their innermost preference. although it's tough, both my hubby and I respect our child's choice. This little boy strives not to be late for school every day, waking up between 6:50-7:00 am consistently for over half a year.  Whenever I ask about his favorite teacher or subject, he always says, I love all the teachers, and I enjoy all the subjects.' But he especially loves the time spent in MindGym and MindSpace. Witnessing my child's joyful anticipation of going to school every day is the happiest moment when sending him to school. Many friends send their children for English tuition, but I feel at MindChamps, I witnessed my child's gradual transformation, not aiming for the best, but improving every day,day by day,bit by bit. This is what I have seen and been most moved by in my child. The MRW and ReadAlong app at MindChamps make it unnecessary for us, a non-English-speaking family, to provide additional tutoring. Of course, this varies from person to person. However, at this stage, I've seen this in my child, and we allow him to progress at his own pace.  Over the years, MindChamps Woodlands and all the teachers have given my child warmth, care, and guidance, nurturing him bit by bit from a small boy into a confident, warm, and sunny big boy. He is graduating K2 this year. Initially, to provide 100% companionship in a warm growing environment for my child, I chose to leave the workforce. Children has to grow in each stage, and as a mother, I believe the nurturing environment and people around them, be it at home or school, are most important. At this moment, I am proud to say my best decision was choosing MindChamps Woodlands.and in primary school, Mindchamps mindspace 's art of learning and continued education on ten value attracted me again. we also signed up for mindspace without hesitation as after school student care center for my child .i believe it will be my another best decision.  Sincerely thanks all the teachers for everything ‚ù§Ô∏è. Your presence makes parents like me feel more secure. And it's because of your silent dedication and guidance that I am even prouder of everything my child has achieved., Teachers are attentive and could see they put a lot of effort in nurturing the students creativity/skills and the effort can be see in all the nice artworks from the students. Keep up the good work teachers!, Great efforts and nice performance done by teachers and students! This showcase will allow us parents to know what are learned for the year. This performance also build confidence in students!, Sent my son here from 18 months till 4! And safe to say, I am glad mindchamps has seen his progress throughout his baby years - from being a scared baby to a more confident 4 year old who is able to articulate his thoughts well:) thank you Teachers and MC Woodlands., Happy parent of a 4th year student at Mindchamps. Excellent learning, interactive classes, professional teachers and wonderful growth in children. Would highly recommend., Love the teachers and school. My child are having a great time in school!, Champs are very good. Excellent work, Hanyu Pinyin Workshop is worth attending as teachers shared on how to teach our kids in learning Hanyu Pinyin in a fun way., Top Brand winner in Preschool Education consistently for 5 Years.

My daughter absolutely enjoyed school everyday, Highly recommended. The teachers are kind, engaging, and patient with kids. Most importantly, they make them feel happy and welcome. The environment is great for kids, take a tour and see for yourself!, My child has been attending MindChamps @ Woodlands since he was 2 years old. Being a reserved child, he was having difficulties expressing himself openly to the teachers. Despite so, the teachers are wonderfully patient and encouraging. 2 years in, he has finally opened up more and express his needs in school. We are ever so delighted to hear about his day and could clearly tell he enjoys school a lot!  We know our child learns best through the play-based learning and is glad that the teaching methods  are align with the needs for our child.  The cleanliness and hygiene practices of the school are also commendable. It gives us more peace of mind that our child is in good hands.  Thank you to all the wonderful teachers in MindChamps Woodlands!  Max's mummy, is a great programme, both parent and champ to join together to play a games and cooking activity., Great effort and talents from teachers! Teachers here are mindful of every individual kids! All the way teachers and champsüòäüíï ‚Ä¶, Honestly a very commendable and highly impressive team of educators and support staff. Too many adjectives i could described this impressive team but it will still be insufficient for just an amazing group of people here.  My little one has grown in confidence and the difference is startling and stark compared to his previous childcare. If you are looking for a childcare that sees and treats your child qs an individual and a person then this is the best childcare you can provide for your child. I am so glad the entire staff doesn't treat my little one as a KPI.  The excellence starts from the top which is the Principal and it just flows naturally to her team and staff from the teachers and admins.  A big shout out and kudos to all the teachers and staff here who have made my little one learning journey a brilliant.  Due to relocation, we have to transfer our little one to another mindchamps but if circumstances were different I would be confident to just continue with mindchamps woodlands., Impressive: when we always wonder what is being taught or learned by kids, when we stepped into the learning environment and watch the kids perform, speak, sing & dance was amazing: thank you champs, teachers and principal, Overwhelmed by the amazing performance on the curriculum showcase day and all the effort and hardship behind this from all the champs and staffs! Thank you for hosting us!, Fun learning environment! Teachers are devoted and dedicated to educate the next gen of leaders and champs., Pleasant learning environment and teachers are all awesome!

We are satisfied with the school's overall focus on curriculum and mindsets training.

Thanks for sharing the tips. Would love to see more workshops organised in future. Good job organising committee! üëç ‚Ä¶, Wonderful day with teachers and students! Keep it up! Thanks for the great job., thoughtful teachers and very well balanced programme!, Encouraging to see the champs grow through every step of their learning journey as they progress., I highly recommend this school!! My son have been in Mindchamps woodlands since 2 years old, now he is 6. He loves attending school.  Teachers are caring and very attentive to the students. The programmes in school really helps engage my son. He learnt lots and grew to love Chinese too! The enrichment classes are very enjoyable for my son too. He especially love the music lessons., Truly a great place to nurture and groom the younglings. Friendly staff and timely updates on the kid's learning progress and comprehensive reports. Lesson plans are well thought of, and can you imagine a school with indoor playground + weekly cooking classes. Highly recommended., All the champs have put up a lot of  effort on such wonderful performance. Thank you., Excellent school and great teachers. My kids love going to school and have learnt alot., Great effort from the teachers & champs to come up with this curriculum engagement., My daughter has been with MindChamps Preschool Woodlands for 4 years now. Through the well designed learning programmed and enrichment classes, not only she has learnt so much but also grew to be more confident. The school has become our extended family with great shared memories., When we first visited MindChamps Preschool, my son was in awe of the aquarium at the reception area. From then, he became more excited to come to school. We would like to commend his teachers who have sparked our son's interest in numbers and art and taught him to be more independent. They also give us updates of his performance that make me and my partner more excited. Thank you for getting us involved in our child's preschool Journey!, Our daughter has been studying at MindChamps@Woodlands for almost 4.5 years. She enjoys going to school everyday. We are very pleased with the school teachers, facilities and programs.  Teachers at MindChamps are professional, caring and dedicated. We appreciate the constant communication with the teachers through app messages, face-to-face meetings, weekly and monthly reports. Up-to-date trainings for the teachers ensure the quality of teaching and learning provided to the students.  The classrooms are inviting and conducive for learning. Our daughter enjoys playtime at MindGym and MindScape. The MindScape is a new playground facility that is only available at Woodlands and Toa Payoh branches.  The program at MindChamps has allowed my child to build a strong foundation. She is able to vocalise her thoughts and express herself well. Lessons such as the show-and-tell sessions, Creativity and Theatrical Strategies have allowed her to build up her confidence and presentation skills. The Reading and Writing lessons enable her to read and write independently from a young age. She also enjoys her MindChamps Music lessons where she has learnt to play the recorder, violin, keyboard and other musical instruments. During Gourmet Moments, she has learnt about food preparation, nutrition, and different cuisines, and is proud to bring home the dish she has prepared in school.  My child has also been instilled moral values such as empathy, kindness and courtesy, and is able to care for others. We are heartened with her growth and development over the past four years and are confident that she will be well-prepared for primary school., My daughter has been with Mindchamps for about a year. The teachers had been really thoughtful and kind towards her! They got her to adapt really quickly to school and there was constant communication with the parents on the progress of my girl. Kudos to the team at Mindchamps Preschool Woodlands!!, After being overseas for the bulk of my child's pre-school years, my husband and I were in search of a pre-school that can continue to develop his social & emotional abilities, and work on his academic skills. We were impressed with the quality of works the Mindchamps' children produced during the centre visit.  In just a couple of months with Mindchamps, he has gained knowledge of  topics he was recently exposed to and has improved tremendously in his languages. The educators put in a lot of efforts in providing a well-rounded experience to develop the children holistically - from introducing the various attractions in Singapore through roleplaying, to learning musical instruments and inculcating good values.  He's always eager to share about his day in school, things he learnt and social interactions with his classmates and we believe that's a good sign that he's thoroughly enjoying his time there!, Sports day was a great initiative. Let‚Äôs have more parent-child activities!, My daughter has been with Mindchamps@Woodlands11 for almost half a year, although her attendance has been affected by COVID a little bit, but still can see her big progress in term of her english speaking, vocabulary, most importantly the confidence of communicating in english. i think we have made a right choice for her to well adapt into english speaking environment as well as keeping up with Chinese learning., The teachers are passionate in teaching, creating a positive and nurturing environment. Keep it up., Lovely school with awesome teachers üåà ‚Ä¶, A amazing place for the kids study here, Well done! Keep it up.üëç ‚Ä¶, Place with great creativity and budding talents!, Loving and caring tachers!, It was a splendid event we thoroughly enjoyed., Teachers are friendly and nice!!

Paying attention to Chinese language teaching must start from life. Listen more, watch more and use more., I am very happy to have the opportunity to participate in the school program. It is very gratifying to see the hard work of the children and teachers. Thank you to the teachers for their careful teaching, so that the children can be happy, grow and learn happily., A happy day, the activities are very attractive, The children are very happy here"
MindChamps Performing Arts PreSchool @ Upper Thomson Road,"It‚Äôs been such a wonderful experience for my son and both my husband and I.  Though my son was enrolled less than 6 months in his last year of preschool before the start of primary 1 in the following year, we‚Äôve seen so much progress in him academically as compared to the 2 years he was in another preschool.  The Principal, teachers and staff have been so helpful and accommodating to my son. They‚Äôve been so kind and warm towards my son that both my husband and I felt so touched, grateful and appreciative for all that they‚Äôve done. You truly feel the love and sincerity that they have towards the kids there.  This preschool is really exceptional, not only have they been so accommodating, they‚Äôve also gone above and beyond to help my boy in his progress not only academically, but also intellectually. He‚Äôs grown to be more confident and has an undaunted attitude towards the start of primary 1.  My son was so excited about going to his new primary 1 school. And it‚Äôs all thanks to the teachers and principal at his preschool who have prepared him well.  My husband and I both appreciate the culture at mindchamps and how they groom our children to be confident individuals and undaunted when faced with challenges.  Thanks once again to all the teachers and principal of this preschool for going above and beyond to help my son not just in preschool but also for the start of his primary 1 adventure. For us as parents, that‚Äôs the most  comforting support., Mindchamps performing arts preschool @Upper Thomson Road was a great preschool choice for our daughter. She learned always so much and was happy to go to school. The kids and teachers were always welcoming her so nicely that until now this nice feeling has not yet been replaced. Thank you teachers and kids for leaving a nice memory in our daughter‚Äôs head ‚ò∫Ô∏è. I will definitely recommend this school to anyone as it‚Äôs a great school., Despite our daughter being a transfer student in N1, the transition was beyond expectations. It was the best decision we ever made to enroll our daughter into Mindchamps Performing Arts Preschool (Tagore Lane). We can tell she is truly happy in school. The school has a Vibrant & Warmth presence. The teachers and team really has made her feel seen and cared for. Their genuine care and concern for our daughter well-being have touched our heart. She has also blossomed in speech, reading & arts! We were surprised she enjoys school so much!  Thank you to the Teachers and team of Mindchamps Performing Arts(Tagore Lane) for keeping the school clean, strict on their hygiene in which we can send our daughter to school at ease & making every day in your respective classroom a memorable experience & providing a nurturing space where our daughter and the kids can flourish academically, socially, and emotionally. The Teachers and Team are remarkable educators and mentors!, My daughter moved from a previous school, N1. In the past 8+ months everyday of school for her have been an absolute joy. She looks forward to going to school, and will even express her unhappiness when we are running late. In the relatively short time span, she have blossomed , with her speech and social skills developing really fast. She will also practise new songs and dances she learnt in school. Grateful to Mindchamps, providing my girl, a warm ,nurturing environment and most importantly, an amazing childhood., My daughter has been a N2 student at MindChamp Preschool since Jan 2023. She finds great joy in her educational experience and adapt quickly into the school environment. Her time at school is consistently marked with happiness and laughter, clearly witnessed when I pick her up from school and her sharing in the evening. I wish to express my appreciation to the dedicated teachers for their hard work and commitment for the past months., My two kids had been study in Mindchamp Preschool and they really enjoyed their school days there. The teachers are great, caring and patient. I can really see my kids improved a lot  from the school learning., MindChamps@Upper Thomson is not a very big school, but full of love. All the teachers are friendly and responsibility. My kid already studied here 1 year and improved in all aspects. He enjoyed his school time so much, I highly recommend., Our son attended PG since Jan 23 and he loves to go to school daily. He is able to speak well and share with us what he did in sch daily. All the teachers are kind and able to remembers their name/character etc. They also organise mthly excursion to parks/esplanade, family day, Chinese appreciation day, year end concert etc., I cannot recommend Mindchamps @Upper Thomson enough for parents looking for a more engaging and nurturing environment for their little ones. My daughter enrolled there when she was 18 months old. She was very shy, so teachers must have made a tremendous effort to make my daughter feel safe and secure there very quickly. My daughter has developed many skills and learned so much during her time at school, from eating and sleeping on her own, socializing with her peers, to learning her colors, shapes, and numbers etc in both English and Chinese.  The music, dance, and drama lessons at this preschool offer a great introduction for us to discover our daughter's interests and talents. Mr Alim, Ms Misellya and Mr Nas did an amazing job to make these lessons so enjoyable. The school also offers weekly reading program and monthly outing program, which we find very enriching and interesting. What sets this preschool apart, though, is the staff's dedication to each child's individual needs and personalities. The PG class size is so small (teacher to student ratio is 2:6) that teachers take the time to get to know each child and tailor their care and education accordingly. My daughter adores her class teachers- Ms Nor & Lin Laoshi, who are both very passionate and responsive and understand my daughter's needs perfectly. They communicate with us on a daily basis, providing updates and feedback that give us peace of mind and help us support our daughter's development at home.  Overall, we are grateful to have found this school and its wonderful team. We feel confident and comfortable leaving our daughter in their care, and she loves going to school every day., Our daughter has been in MindChamps for 8 months (since 18 months old). In these 8 months that have absolutely flown by, we have seen dramatic all-round development in her. Being an only child and grandchild, she has learnt to interact and share with children of her age, and from what we hear from her teachers, display some early leadership skills as well. She particularly enjoys dance and music classes in school, and she looks forward excitedly whenever she has to wear her dance outfit to school. She recently went for her first ever school excursion and had many fond memories of it to share with the family when she came home. It is clear to us that she looks up to and adores her teachers, and enjoys her time in school, as she always smiles when we talk about her teachers and is always pretending to be the teacher at home to her cuddly toys. Kudos to all the teachers in Mindchamps for providing a loving and nurturing environment for our daughter to learn in!, Nurturing teachers who provide a safe and learning environment for my child. The school brings them on interesting excursions frequently as well. My child enjoys going to school., We always thought that all pre-schools are the same i.e., how different can it be when all we need is a daycare center where children just eat, sleep, and play? We later realised it wasn't quite the case!  As we moved house, we transferred our almost 3-yo toddler from her previous preschool to MindChamps Upper Thomson. With a smaller and intimate class setting, she took just a couple days to settle-in and after 6 months being here, she wakes up looking forward to go to school every morning ‚Äì sometimes asking for school during the weekend!  We observed that the MindChamps curriculum is comprehensive, and our LO has developed a lot since ‚Äì she speaks a lot more at home and gets more and more articulate by the day ‚Äì in both English and Chinese. She also particularly enjoys the music, dance, and drama classes, which we are also kept very informed by the frequent newsletters and updates from the teachers. With the weekly reading activities encouraged by the school in partnership with the parents at home, our LO has also cultivated the habit of reading (accompanied) and her love for books.  The smaller class size and undivided attention worked well for our LO who thrives in a more intimate environment. More importantly, the teachers are also very professional, friendly, and patient üòä Special shout-out to her favorite teachers ‚Äì Zhao Laoshi, Ms Jane, Mr Alim, Mr Naz and Misellya,¬†kudos!, I highly recommend MindChamps Upper Thomson to all parents. My daughter who has started school since the start of the year, has progressed so much in all aspects- social, emotional, fine and gross motor skills as well as literacy skills too. The teachers are friendly, nurturing, patient and they keep parents up to date about anything regarding their child. The curriculum is good and my kid has benefitted greatly. I am happy as a parent to send my kid to school everyday as she also looks forward to going too., Ms Joy and Deng Laoshi are very patient and put lots of time and effort to help my kid to improve in eating and learning since we joined the school. My kid has significant improvement in English, Chinese and eating habits. Ms Joy and Deng Laoshi always encourage my kid and provide patient guidance in school. They also communicate promptly with us to share all the happenings in school about my kid. We greatly appreciate both Ms Joy and Deng Laoshi on the effort and love that they have put in culturing our kid. Last but not least, our kid also enjoyed Ms Dorothy‚Äôs reading&writing classes, Ms Lya‚Äôs dance classes and Mr Alim‚Äôs music classes!, Ever since the performing arts curriculum was put in place, i could see my child becoming more confident, and she enjoys going to school everyday. She would also come home and share with us what she has learnt in class. Thanks to all the teachers for their patience and guidance, she has definitely blossomed!, MindChamps Upper Thomson is such a vibrant and happy place. It is an awesome environment for both learning and character development. Our kids come home singing new songs and excitedly sharing the things they learnt. Their affection for the school is clearly evident from how they proudly say ‚ÄúThis is my MindChamps!‚Äù every time they pass by the school on weekends. As a parent, I deeply appreciate the school‚Äôs effort to organise activities for the children beyond the curriculum, such as field trips and concerts. I also know that I can count on the teachers to give me feedback and tackle any issues together. Never been this thankful. :), MindChamps has developed my children‚Äôs language skills in English and Mandarin They also inculcates good values and sense of hard work. Indeed, MindChamps did a great job in preparing them for primary school., Great school and my son loves the environment!, It only took 5 days for my 20-month-old child to go to Mindchamps from being nervous and timid at the beginning to now going to school happily every morning. In the first two days of school, I stayed with him for two mornings to help my child adapt. When the child cries, the teacher can hold the child in one hand during class. The classmates are also very happy to help the new friends. I feel the enthusiasm and warmth of the teacher and classmates. The school's curriculum is also very good. Food education and morality Intellectual, physical, art and labor are combined. Children also like music classes and dance classes very much. Every teacher is very kind and loving. It is a trustworthy kindergartenüëç"
MindChamps PreSchool @ Nordcom II,"We never regretted to send our kids to this PreSchool since 2021. Every staff in this center is dedicated and passionate about their job. We can see all of them love the students at all times. Also additional effort made by the teachers to constantly update the parents about the progress are much appreciated. Well done Mindchamps PreSchool Nordcom II...!, We never regretted sending our daughter here. The environment and all the teachers here are full of love. Ms Nicol is always very responsive and helpful. Their class teachers are very patient as my daughter started with zero English listening and speaking. Now she is able to communicate smoothly in English. They also offered special caring to her as she was very timid before she started school and she is much more outgoing now. We certainly love this PreSchool!, We are grateful to all the teachers in MindChamps Nordcom II especially Ms Nicol, I remember she invited us during celebrations before my son officially joined the school, it helped to integrate him into the new school better. We appreciate the prompt actions when we have any queries. Thank you Ms Chris, Ms Naz, Ms Du, Ms Lili,  Ms Gao and many other teachers who had taught and guided my son these years. I remembered Ms Lili helped to coax him even though she was not in charge of his class. I thank Ms Gao for carrying him when he was under your charge. I appreciate the timely updates from Ms Naz & Ms Du about him. Thank you Ms Chris for sharing useful tips in his development. It's heartwarming to see the school functions like a family where everyone knows one another, my son knows all the teachers too even those who don't teach him.  MindChamps Nordcom II has great facilities that makes it a welcoming school, the newly integrated playground is a hit! Every week, he looks forward to Thursday for the play. We also love the effort put in by the teachers in decorating the classrooms as well as their craft work. He did ferris wheel, panda and dinosaurs which are big projects with the help of teachers.  Thank you!, My kids love the school! The facilities are great, and the owner is hands-on and attentive. The dedicated teachers and staffs create a wonderful environment for the kids. Highly recommended! :), Special mention to Ms Chris, È´òËÄÅÂ∏à and Ms Nicol! My daughter  has been attending Mindchamps since N2 and we absolutely love the school! We've been thrilled with our child's experience at Mindchamps ‚Äì the school fosters a love of learning in them. The school offers a variety of extracurricular activities including music, sports and  cooking class. These have allowed my child to explore their interests and develop new skills. We would definitely recommend Mindchamps to other parents looking for a great educational experience for their child., My husband and I didn't have a specific school in mind when we wanted to enrol our son into preschool. We checked out all schools nearby and decided to go with Mindchamps Nordcom because we were impressed with Miss Nicol who is the Centre Director when we visited the school. Indeed, the experience we have had so far with our son did not disappoint. Mindchamps curriculum is well established but that aside, credits to Miss Nicol for running the centre extremely well and holding high levels of operational standards. Special call out to the teachers too! Miss Alice, Mr Rino, Miss Valerie, Hua Hua laoshi, Huang laoshi, and Miss Lak, for their guidance and care to the champs!, Nicole is a great center PIC and educator. The teachers are responsible and kind. We have peace of mind knowing that our daughter is in good hands at school. Thank you Teacher Hao, Teacher Lili, Teacher Ally, Mr Rhino, and Everyone at MindChamps@Nordcom II !, Today was 1st visit to the school for my wife, daughter and me.  Really impressed with the management, especially the center director Nicol.  Sets a high bar for operational quality, hiring and site management.  Looking forward to great school days ahead for my daughter +  Update 1:  I came back to edit this comment because I was so impressed with the school's operations.  It shows on my daughter's development - her vocabulary has increased at least 2x (especially Mandarin) in the past 1 month., To Ms Nicol and all Mindchamps @Nordcom II teachers,  Thank you for all the love, care, and dedication that you put into teaching Nathan Cai. We are beyond grateful for your guidance and support. Specially thanks to Ms Chris & È´òËÄÅÂ∏à for being an amazing teacher to Nathan and his classmates. ‚ù§Ô∏è üíú üß°üíöüíõüíô, Penning this together with hubby Kelvin Ong. Our daughter Hillary has grown and developed so much and so quickly since she was onboarded to N1C in Jan 2022 and has been a beneficiary of the kind and patient guidance of lead teachers (Ms Ally and Hao Laoshi) as well as other teachers / staff at Mindchamps @ Nordcom II. Being cooped largely at home due to Covid before joining a pre-school, Hillary was slower than her peers in expressing herself with words. With much learning and exposure to the nurturing environment and teachers at MC, she can now just yak on and on, albeit mostly in English. But she has to now work really hard on her Mandarin though to communicate better with her grandma and friends who use mainly Mandarin., Mindchamps @ Nordcom exceeds our expectations in many ways. Teachers are highly qualified, dedicated, caring and best of all, they work in close partnership & communication with Parents.  This preschool is a dream come true for Parents like me. ‚ÄãThey have one of the best, if not the best team of Teachers who are talented in their own ways (musically, intellectually, artistically etc.) & the Champs curriculum is enriching and fun. Centre Director, Ms Nicol can be seen on the ground supporting her team of Teachers always, it is very assuring to know what the centre is run with much love & attention.  My 3 kids loves going to school and that‚Äôs most important to me., My elder daughter joined in 2019 N2 level when the school just started operating. She felt at home instantly from the first day. In her 3yrs with Mc Nordcom2, I have never heard from her that she does not want to go to school in the morning. It says a lot about the overall vibe and cheerful environment that is truly unique to this school. She graduated in 2021 and moved on to primary school and I must say that mindchamp nc2 teachers prep their graduates very well for transitioning to primary school (spelling, show n tell, numerical etc). She was awarded all-rounder award at the end of her p1 academic year.  My younger boy joined in 2021 PG. I must thank the school and teacher for helping him transition from home to PG smoothly. He took around 2 weeks to get used to morning routine of going to school. Beyond that on most days, he does not struggle going to school. We saw him grew tremendously in term of language skill, motor skill, social skill, music skill etc. We were so thankful that it was his teacher who potty trained him successfully while we as parent were struggling to train him at home. From the very start he joined, the school teachers has kept very open and transparent communications in partnering with us as parents handling the various request and feedback. This is made possible thanks to the support of the school management championed by the centre director, who also happen to be the owner Ms Nicol.  Would also like to point out usually if I have any issues or questions to ask, teachers / center director would reply in timely manner. At times, if need to, they would deep dive into the issue for the answer and solution.  Hygiene : 5/5 Food: 4/5 Comm with parents: 5/5 Center Facilities: 5/5, We were previously from Mindchamps Nordcom but had to move to another Mindchamps centre. It was unfortunate because we can feel a difference between Mindchamps at Nordcom compared to others. At Nordcom, the teachers and Ms Nicol adds that extra touch of love and warm. Our child misses Nordcom and will always mention his old classmates from Nordcom. All the best Ms Nicol. Even till today, they still meet up for birthday parties., Principle & Teachers are equally competent. Environment of the school is very welcoming which makes my daughter love her class so much!, My son is very happy to go to school everyday.  He likes all the teachers and staffs. He enjoys all the activities as well! Thank you!, Our daughter joined MindChamps N2 class at age three. she used to be a shy girl with little confidence to talk or share in public. We are impressed by her changes, including both characters and capabilities.  We are grateful for teachers‚Äô patience and guidance to her(especially Ms. Aztina & Âê¥ËÄÅÂ∏à), which make her become a confident girl who believe in herself and always say ‚ÄúI am the best!‚Äù.  In general, we are satisfied with the school‚Äôs overall focus on curriculum and mindsets training. And hope she would achieve more in the coming year.  Great thanks, Olivia, No regrets sending my boy here. Very engaging methodologies are applied which ensure kids learn and retain knowledge effectively. Ms Chris and Gao Laoshi have taken very good care of my boy. Thanks to Ms Nicol for excellent management of the center!, As a first time parent sending our child to a preschool, we had of course, all the worries ahead of us such as if our child can get used to the environment and his teachers. Though the beginning was quite a challenge for us at drop offs, we were assured by Nicol and her team of teachers with occasional photo updates of our son in school via text messages.  Foremost, we are truly grateful for all the teachers in the campus, their dedication and patience (especially) is truly admirable. On some days when my son whines at drop offs, any teachers who came across me would gladly receive my son over, and it seems that my child knows every of the teachers in the centre and willingly allow them to carry over albeit emotional. The focus in ensuring every child enters the school on a positive morning is visibly rendered on a professional level, proven with the team work that came along with this observation.  We are truly thankful to Ms Cyn, Chen Lao shi and Wang lao shi for being the primary influence of our son‚Äôs inaugural school experience. It is indeed a job beyond the word ‚Äúdifficult‚Äù and we deeply appreciate their care towards our child while he is left in the centre under their care. Thumbs up to Nicol and your team of awesome teachers!, My younger daughter - Chloe Long joined K1 mindchamp Norcom early this year . We are very impressed with how she grows and learn during her tenure in K1 ; she demonstrates the ability of  understanding the concepts on her own way with the directive she learned from her teachers. I can honestly said that the way teacher nurtures the champs play an important part and leave a deep impact on their lil mind. She always impressed us through her conversations and action on her daily activities. In short, Chloe is so proud to be part of MindChamp family with the dedicated teachers and excellent environment., BIG Thank You!!!‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è to all the Teachers & Staff of MindChamps PreSchool @ Nordcom IIüëèüëèüëè We have seen a dramatic progress in our little champ N2 journey! We have seen how her confidence level has improved, her critical thinking, and her social skill!üí™üí™üí™ Very Well Done & Good Job!!! Special mention to Ms Aztina, Ms Wu Hong and Ms Nicol!!üëèüëèüëè - Proud Parents of Maria Aondreah Uchi Tating, I would like to says a Big Thank You to MindChamps Preschool @ Nordcom. Principle (Ms Nicol) and all Teachers ( especially to Ms Aztina and Âê¥ËÄÅÂ∏à Ôºâare really dedicated and responsible and their passion to grow and nature N2 Champs are remarkable. I look forward my child going to K1 next year. Well done and great effort throughout this year 2020. üëç üëçüëç, Excellent! Good environment! Teachers are very professional and friendly. The most important thing is kids really enjoy school time, and even want to go school on the weekend!!! it definitely will be a very happy learning journey for them., We really love the facilities. There‚Äôs an indoor drama/music centre, gym and recently an indoor playground. The school also get to use the basketball and pool facilities at the roof top. We love the great balance between academic and play at school., Love the professionalism of the team (especially Ms Nicol (principal), Ms Chris, Ms Gao, Ms Nira, Wang laoshi, Ms Supu), my girls enjoy going to school and I like that they focus on Chinese language, which is crucial for primary school preparation. Thank you MindChamps @ Nordcom II., I personally know the owners running this school.  They have a big heart and huge passion for young kids. That‚Äôs what every young parent need. A peace of mind that your young is well taken care of."
MindChamps PreSchool @ Yio Chu Kang,"Hands down the best place for my little one. Curriculum is robust, the extra curriculum activities are engaging to both parents and child too! Not forgetting the teachers and staffs there, they are amazing! You can tell when someone is passionate about their job, going above and beyond, giving their best for the little ones.  Mr Dave, Ms Isabelle, Ms Irish, ËÇñËÄÅÂ∏à, Ms Cynthia, Ms Rin, Ms Sippy and all teachers, thank you for being a part of my daughter's life. We thank you from the bottom of our hearts., Having gone through less than ideal experiences with previous childcare centres, we were stringent about finding the right one for Chloe. Thankfully, we gave MindChamps PreSchool @ Yio Chu Kang a chance ‚Äì and fast forward to today, we are glad to have made that decision.  It was a challenging time for Chloe, who at 4, had to adapt to a new sibling and a new school environment at the same time. We are grateful to have Ms. Michelle as her main teacher, who is very passionate, dedicated, attentive and most importantly, genuinely interested in the well-being of the children. She assured us that Chloe would develop well under her guidance and indeed she benefited from the excellent learning environment.  We are also grateful for ÂÆãËÄÅÂ∏à, who within a short span of time has helped Chloe to improve dramatically in Chinese, especially in terms of handwriting and her careful attention to the Chinese strokes (Á¨îÁîª). We are truly blessed to have another amazing teacher in this school.  Finally, it is great leadership that pushes exemplary qualities in the staff and teachers. For this, we have Mr. Dave to thank for he never fails to listen to our feedback and recommendations despite his busy schedule. His enthusiasm and passion towards preschool education can be seen in his ever-consistent search of an all-rounded education for the kids such as organising sports and activities to enrich the children‚Äôs experiences and physical and mental developments.  MindChamps PreSchool @ Yio Chu Kang has given us the confidence and assurance to enroll my younger daughter into PG class in the coming month. Keep up the amazing work!, This is a commendable preschool not only because of their well-planned curriculum, but also their child-friendly facilities. All of their play and learning room are safe and painted with fun colors which my daughter really likes. Teachers are also competent and passionate to little learners., They have a well balance of teaching of values and academics. There‚Äôs great communication platform between parents and teachers."
MindChamps PreSchool @ Yishun,"Teachers changed very frequently. Some teachers are very rude to kids, for they scold kids very loudly. The most failure to attend this preschool was i believed they would teach the kids very well in English and Chinese, so stopped the tutor classes in other institutions. However, i found the kid's phonics and pinyin are so poor at last..., As parents, we do our best to nurture and be the strong foundation for our child, but with Teachers, they inspire hopes, imaginations and the love of learnings!  It takes a Big Heart to shape little Minds. Thank you  MindChamps for doing a great job!, Send your kids here. They get great education., Super friendly teachers! Thanks for taking care of my niece who learnt so much from you."
MindChamps PreSchool @ Junction 10,"After four years at Mindchamps J10, my affection for this school has only grown stronger. I adore the close-knit community here..it feels like I‚Äôm reliving my own school days. From the sweetest teachers and principals to the wonderful parents, everyone is closely bonded.  Last month, our class organized a food donation drive, which deeply touched both me and my daughter. It was incredibly meaningful to be able to help needy families in our community. From packing to sorting to distributing, we all worked together seamlessly.  Studying here isn‚Äôt just about teachers and students..it feels like a second home. We‚Äôve never once regretted choosing Mindchamps J10., My son has been with MC10 since PG and he is K1 now. Super awesome and caring teachers and principal. Very appreciative of their dedication!  Thank you to the MCM (MindChamps Music) teachers for taking the initiative by organizing an introductory session of the violin for the parents too. It was useful to us so that we can guide our Champs appropriately when they practice at home., My son has been w MC J10 for a year now. MC has great and dedicated teachers who teaches the value of respect and makes a point in remembering every child's name. 2 thumbs up to Teacher Doreen, gls & wls.  We are very impressed. A very big thank you to the teachers & school for 101% effort, patience & hard work., We recently participated in the food donation drive event organized by MindChamps, and it was an incredibly rewarding experience for our family. Not only did we have the opportunity to contribute to a worthy cause, but we also witnessed firsthand the positive impact it had on our child.  Through this event, our child learned the importance of generosity, empathy, and community involvement. Seeing the joy on the faces of those who received our donations was truly heartwarming and left a lasting impression.  We are grateful for the dedication and hard work of our child's teachers, Ms. Lydia and Shu Ling Lao Shi, and the center Principle, Ms. Sharlene who instill these values on a daily basis.  Additionally, the support and involvement of the parent community around our child's class were instrumental in the success of the event.  Thank you to MindChamps J10 for organizing such a meaningful event, and to everyone involved for their dedication and support. We look forward to participating again in the future!, Super fun children‚Äôs day event. My kid is super enjoying the stay at MC JC10. Thank you all the teachers. Special shot out to Ms Eunice and Zhang Laoshi. üëç ‚Ä¶, Definitely 100% efforts from the teachers to make all the events fun and exciting for the champs! Love the vibes from the teachers!, Great school with very caring teachers and alot of effort in planning the excursions and special events, e.g. children day. Special shout out to Ms Doreen, Geng Lao shi, Ms Eunice and Zhang Lao shi. My children love the teachers very much üòç ‚Ä¶, We started our firstborn at Mindchamps J10 since Playgroup, and the curriculum has exposed her to opportunities for a holistic growth in the domains of language, cognitive development and socio-emotional skills. The school also provides a conducive environment for learning with its well thought-out and organized classrooms and facilities.  She returns home excitedly every day and shares with us the activities and experiences she has gone through in school. Not only has she formed strong friendships with her classmates (us parents have formed great friendships too!), but also developed good rapport with her supportive teachers and even non-teaching staff. Communication between parents and teachers has always been transparent and prompt with the Mindchamps app, as we are constantly updated with our child‚Äôs progress and well-being in school. Her increasing independence and curiosity stand as evidence of the effectiveness of Mindchamp‚Äôs pedagogical approach and the professionalism of J10‚Äôs teaching team.  Our secondborn started his school journey in July 2023. At just slightly over 6 months, we have noticed remarkable progress in his language, numeracy, and social interaction skills. With his new found friendships and deep bonds with the teachers, he is ecstatic to go to school every day and is loving and enjoying every moment in school.  Thank you Mindchamps J10, for helping the 2 Js grow, learn and most importantly, for making their early school years memorable and cherished!, My boy has been with Mindchamps @ J10 for the past 3-4 years (from PlayGroup till K1 currently), and we have witnessed how he has learned and grown throughout his time at Mindchamps. The teaching staff are very meticulous in their work, and would tirelessly plan extra activities outside of the usual curriculum to allow the champs to learn in an experiential manner in different environments outside of the classroom. Curriculum aside, when we observe the champs interact outside of the classroom environment, we could tell that the teachers have inculcated a certain level of decorum expected of the champs in social interaction, and this is testament to the culture of the school, which is greatly influenced by how the school is run., Our child has been with Mindchamps J10 since N1 and this has been the best decision we have made for him! He looks forward to school everyday which really makes us assured that he is well taken care of.  Their K1 class recently organised a project ‚ÄúGive a Hand, Give a Can‚Äù where they collaborated with Fei Yue Active Ageing Centre to collect, pack and distribute donated food items and necessities for family in needs. It was heartwarming to see all the teachers and parents come together to contribute for this meaningful event. Through this, the kids had the opportunity to become community helpers for a day and learn how their small little action can make a significant difference in the lives of others.  We highly recommend Mindchamps J10 to anyone looking for a childcare for their kids in this area! Thanks to all the wonderful teachers in doing such great jobs to care for our children!, My child has been with the school for the past 4 years. Teachers are all very caring and nurturing,  and always put in effort and support the child growth. More than happy to have my child enrolled here!, My daughter simply loves MindChamps! She is blessed to have met dedicated caring teachers who provided good care and guidance in her daily needs. A shout out to Ms Sharlene, Zhang Laoshi, Miss Jolynn, Miss Lim, Miss Esther and Miss Katy.  Our Champ comes home with stories of your kindness, creativity, and the exciting activities you have all planned. It‚Äôs clear that they have not only been her teacher but also a source of inspiration and comfort.  You‚Äôve helped her grow, learn, and most importantly, feel safe and cherished in your care. I truly appreciate her teachers for making her preschool experience memorable and for being a positive influence in her life. Your impact reaches far beyond the classroom.  Happy Children‚Äôs Day to the amazing Team of Teachers!, We went to 4 preschools school tour before deciding to enrolled our girl over to j10 Mindchamps.  What made us chose j10 MC : We love their new renovated playground, it is safe and sheltered. Kids can have water play, picnic and many fun activities there! As their playground is located out of the mall, We were worried that it might be too noisy.. so we went to check the traffic condition at several timing, and to our surprise, only peak hours about 5.30-6pm there was an increase of traffic.  We also like how they communicate effectively with parents in their own school app. I get to see updates like - what time my girl enters school, temperature checking and more.  So much thought and effort is put into the educational activities as well. I know my daughter loves being here, and i wouldn't take her anywhere else.  We‚Äôre so happy with our decision. This is her year 1 and I‚Äôm sure she will enjoy her 5 years here. ‚ù§Ô∏è, Amazing team of teachers, love their creativity in their planning for events and celebrations! So much fun for the children always! Thank you for the great effort put in, leaving precious memories for them!, We love the variety of enrichment activities. Our son enjoyed the music lessons. The exposure to different instruments is great, and helped him to discover his love for piano., Very nice teachers, my girl so lover her teachers., My elder daughter started with MC @J10 since it 1st opened up in 2015. In a flash of an eye, 6yrs had passed and now my younger daughter is going to spend her last year in MC in 2022.  I'm happy to see how my girls had developed overall throughout the years they had been in the centre (not just in studies, but even in the soft skills like leadership, adaptability, problem solving and social cohesiveness).  We had always found the teachers and directors at MC @J10 to be approachable and genuine in wanting to care for the children under them (maybe we were just blessed that my 2 girls had great teachers).  I had observed how improvements were made to the infrastructure over the years. I had seen the outdoor playground get refurbished into a garden area before a new playground was added as well. This makes water play so much more meaningful when we still remember how it originally was.  With the addition of the Allied care centre below, I have no doubt that the centre's management is looking towards providing awesome care for a larger spectrum of children (including those who might need additional assistance to integrate better into mainstream education). Kudos to their foresight and planning!  Here's to wishing MC @J10 and it's teaching staffs many more fantastic years ahead, creating better futures for our future generations!  Sincerely, Benjamin Celeste and Adele's Daddy, Fun and interactive activities done for Children's Day! My child has so much fun!, Thank you teachers (special shout-out to Ms Shakina, Yanfang Laoshi, Ms Esther, Ms Linda who have worked with us closely to ensure Thad adapted well to a whole new environment) for loving and nurturing our beloved child. What we find most amazing is the boy who used to cry at check-in every single day at his previous school, now wakes us up in the morning to send him to school asap so he can take part in all the activities/games/excursions that are planned. Thank you teachers and staff of Mindchamps J10!!, We started our son Isaac at Mindchamps J10 when he was 1.5 years old, just before the Covid pandemic started. He showed great affinity for the school as he was attentive and curious while we were taking a tour of the campus ‚Äì and since then he has embarked on a thrilling journey with the kindergarten. Mindchamps provides a conducive environment for Isaac to learn and grow over the years ‚Äì he picked up social skills quickly and displays proficiency in both Mandarin and English (yes he even challenges our vocabulary now!) and it is evident he has a great love for music and reading.  We especially appreciate the hard work put in by the teachers and staff at MindChamps J10 during the Covid period when classes were conducted online and regular updates were provided to parents through the Mindchamps app with lots of pictures and curriculum details.  And the teachers put in a lot of effort to give us a detailed write up of what Isaac learns every term, not just in English but also in Chinese. We are very glad that we can share photos of what Isaac does in school everyday with his grandparents as well!  Now Isaac looks forward to going to school every morning (Not just because of Fun Toast!) but he tells us that he looks forward to seeing his teachers and friends ‚Äì so much so he wants to stay back after school hours to continue playing with his classmates.  Thank you Mindchamps J10, for your love and dedication to Isaac! üòä, The school is located on the 2nd floor of the Junction 10 building. While I generally like the class schedule and the gym, I found the food being catered from elsewhere not so ideal. The fact the indoor gym is located next door means children have to put back their shoes to go to indoor gym classes, and take them off again. The outdoor playground is next to the junction, which is lots of traffic noises., Happy children's day! The champs had great fun today. Thanks to all teachers and staff who have put in so much effort to organise the games and performance., Excellent teacher crew with a caring principal. Student well being are well taken care of and parent could be at ease. Highly recommend: special shout out to n1 growth teacher , ms Doreen and Geng Lao Shi., Even though our son Aydan has only been with MindChamps for 8 months since he was 1.5 years old, witnessing his remarkable growth in every aspect truly affirms MindChamps as our preschool of choice. Aydan enjoys going to school and this speaks volume on the school‚Äôs holistic curriculum and the dedicated teachers & staff. Learning is fun and interactive through play, music, art, gourmet, etc.  The ease of communication with the teachers (with prompt replies) as well as regular updates/reports with pictures & videos via the MindChamps app is immensely useful and appreciated. The teachers and staff are always warm and friendly. As a parent, trust and assurance is crucial so that you can have a peace of mind, knowing your child is in good hands.  The regular events organised by the school such as festival celebrations, field trips, etc not only provides Aydan a different kind of learning experience and exposure, it also fosters bonding between us & Aydan and with the teachers.  We are sincerely grateful towards MindChamps and the J10 team for playing an important role in nurturing our next generation. The continued collaboration between us parents and MindChamps during Aydan's formative years will certainly stand him in good stead in future.  Thank you MindChamps J10!, Kyler followed his elder brother and joined Mindchamps @J10 since Playgroup and this shows how confident we are with the Mindchamps program and the school at Junction 10. As parents, we are grateful and appreciative of the school and teachers' effort to take in our feedback and work together.  Kyler used to have issues with pronunciation and was apprehensive of saying out new words. It was the school and teachers teamwork that helped nurture Kyler into a confident child. He is no longer afraid of pronouncing the word wrongly, and takes it as a challenge and enjoys the fun of learning. Since playgroup until K2, on a weekly basis, kyler has to bring back English and Chinese reading books provided by the school. And everyweek without fail, we would read with him. This has become a reading habit for kyler and us to read and bond together through the book section.  With the introduction of violin into the music program, Kyler discovered his passion for music and fun with violin. He loves it so much that he requested for us to engage a violin teacher for extra lessons.  There is never a single day that he refused or was reluctant to go to school, and this shows that the really engaging teachers and the environment.  Thank you Mindchamps@J10. It has been quite a journey and I can say that Kyler loves every part of it, especially the numerous party and costume dress up days! And special shout out to the dedicated teachers Ms. Paula, Gui laoshi, Ms. Charmaine, Ms Katie, Ms.Kaylyn, Ms. Esther and principal Ms. Sharlene!, Came here through a recommendation of a friend to view the school to enroll my first born. It was the second school we viewed and as we walked through and found out more about the activities and programs they will be going through, we were sold.  I like that they also incorporate music into studies so they can make use of their creativity.  I was worried if it would be difficult for her to fit in as she was going to be attending school for the first time in her life and because of COVID I could only be with her for half a day, but wow I‚Äôm so amazed at the adaptability and the welcoming of the teachers.

Without a doubt, we signed up for Athena on the spot.  The school environment is very clean, organized, and well-thought out. It provides a conducive learning and safe playing environment for the children. The curriculum not only develops the child in academics, but it enhances their motor, emotional, musical, and social interaction abilities as well. This is truly a holistic way of nurturing our children as they advance through their early childhood.  Athena started her journey with MindChamps J10 in January 2021. At just slightly over a year mark, we have noticed remarkable progress in Athena‚Äôs language, numeracy, and social interaction skills. From the early days of reaching the school entrance in tears to where we are today, she is loving and enjoying every little moment that she has spent in school.  Almost every other day, she would ecstatically return home and explain to us in great length on what she has done for the day. We were also pleasant to find that she has developed a good rapport with her class and several strong friendships within her classmates. It makes her day in school even more fulfilling.  Communication between the staffs and parents are transparent and prompt. Through digital means such as the MindChamps App and email, we are constantly being updated with our child‚Äôs progress and school matters.  The Covid-19 pandemic has been with us for almost a good 2 years. Whilst many schools could not organize group activities or outdoor field-trips due to the pandemic restrictions, MindChamps J10 were able to think out of the box and help to engage the children in different meaningful ways.  My wife and I would like to thank MindChamps J10 wholeheartedly for creating such a pleasant environment for Athena to learn and play. We look forward to seeing Athena progressing through her early childhood in MindChamps J10., My son and daughter love this school as teachers are very kind and patient, Mindchamps Junction 10 has done an excellent job in cultivating a nurturing and fun environment where kids can learn with enjoyment.

After this year of study and life, he has learned a lot of knowledge and learned how to be humble, cooperative and helpful in activities with children. She also has more valuable language skills, imagination, curiosity and enterprising spirit... All of this is attributed to our teachers. From the careful arrangement of daily recipes, from the meticulous weekly teaching arrangements, and from the honors children receive every time. We know: In order to give your children a good enlightenment education and for their continuous growth, you have been working hard.

The teachers have always done their best to help and support them when they needed it. As always, we are extremely pleased with the school and encourage any prospective students or parents to visit., A loving centre for my child, she really likes it. And they have resourceful books for children., MindChamps PreSchool @ Buangkok takes great pride in their operations on a day to day and it is no surprise that its operations and security is run like a well oiled-machine.

Let's just say you get what you pay for and I am highly grateful to mindchamps buangkok for its staff, educators and principal (not forgetting the buildings facility and bus operators) for all they have done to make the entire experience almost flawless and high quality. We like the personal touch of the place and clean, well maintained levels of sustenance. Kudos!, Our child has been attending school at MindChamps Buangkok for over a year now. We are glad that she has been has been exposed to different lessons: from learning literacy to self-expression to music lessons to Chinese characters recognition to even making her own sandwich!

Great place to be in!, Our daughter commenced her journey at Mindchamps Buangkok (""MCBKK"") since N1 way back in early 2019.  She participated and we just attended her K2 graduation ceremony 3 weeks back and she will be leaving Mindchamps as a confident and articulate ""K3"" to start her P1 formal education very shortly.  During the course of the last 4 years, both my wife and I have much to thank the whole team at MCBKK principle, teachers and support staff.  It is inevitable that there will always be turnover for any childcare though I know MCBKK will try their best to retain and replace. Kids are also more resilient than what most parents think and adapt quickly.  Nonetheless as I reflect, would I have trusted my daughter with MCBKK all over again?  The answer is a definite ""yes' for the following reasons.  - Great partnership between parents and entire MCBKK team, bus driver and bus auntie included. - Genuine and professional teachers and staff who really care and bother - Clean, bright and cheerful environment - Holistic educational experience that covers English, Chinese, Math, reading, writing, physical education, art, gourmet, performance and music just to name some. - Honest and timely feedback from teachers - Supportive fellow parents and wonderful classmates  Covid was a trying period for all of us and I could appreciate the amount of consideration, stress and work that went behind as the MCBKK team tried to maintain a safe and healthy environment for the kids while keeping up with their programme.  Special mention Ms Ng, Ms Yun,  Ms Shannon, Ms Mabel, Ms Beth, Ms Amanda, Ms Cass, Ms Fu, Ms Stella and ex-teachers Ms Eileen and Ms Zhang Qian.  A big Thank You to all of you!  All of you have been instrumental in one way or another for our child's growing up journey.  We are always grateful and appreciative and definitely like to share our gratitude and experience with any parents who are currently in their taunting process of selecting a pre-school for their little ones.  There is no perfect pre-school but only the most suitable one. For us, we are happy to have partnered MCBKK for our child's journey.   She will be all ready for P1 in a few days' time. :-), Amazing environment with lovely teachers! We love teacher kym, highly recommended., The whole brain training championed by Mindchamps has worked well for my children in honing their academic and lingustic skills, sometimes I'm taken aback by the abilities my children have gained through their time at Mindchamps Buangkok which has a great team. And the brief exposure through Mindchamp's music curriculum seems to have made the miraculous difference., Great environment and teachers. My son is truly happy going to Mindchamp here., My son has been attending Mindchamps Buangkok for the past 1 year plus and we are really glad that we chose this preschool. He cannot speak or utter a single word when he first joined there, but under the care and guidance of the team, he is an expressive, active little boy now and likes to talk about anything under the sun in English and Mandarin! I would like to thank Miss Shannon, Miss Kym, Miss Ren and the rest of the team for taking such good care of him. The school has brought out his musical talents as well.

Through the patience and guidance of Miss Ng/ ‰∫ëËÄÅÂ∏à, my son is now able to read / write more confidently than before. I recalled when he first joined, his english writings were still shaky and he couldn't even write a single chinese word.

Once again, we appreciate the patience, love and guidance rendered to my son., Fun sports day for parent child bonding!, The school has such a friendly and warm vibe. Very enriching as well., It's the school holidays and we have been sending our son for holiday programmes to enrich his time. Last school holiday he attended MindChamps Actors Centre Kids Bootcamp and he was having a blast! The trainer is so engaging and he returns home each day excited about all that he did and learned during the session. MindChamps runs this bootcamp every school holiday. He is attending the 5-day programme for 3 1/2 hrs each day. He was supposed to attend this year but due to the current situation, he might just have to wait for next year but it's worth the wait., Very clean and well maintained center. Extremely responsive to queries. Both my children study here. Must applaud the teachers, support staff and management for their efforts .

Also, my daughters Chinese teacher (PG) gave my daughter chinese flashcards with English  to practice at home. Very impressive.. The teachers just don't so their job as a job. They take it more personal and are soo involved in the child's development . Even on the lines of character development, the teacher (k1 & k2) helps out during class to mould their behavior if you request them on specific aspects. Would like to thank all the teachers and staffs for doing a fantastic job. Overall  will surely recommend mindchamps @buangkok!, After months of searching for a preschool for my daughter, I have finally found Mindchamps Buangkok to be our preferred choice in this neighborhood. Likely to be one of the best that offers an all-rounded curriculum and one with personalized feedback .  We have seen a significant progression in our daughter's learning journey since she was transferred from another preschool at N1 last year. One example is that my daughter is able to recognise her name and write it independently now.  Kudos to the dedicated team that Principal Shannon leads. Their parent-teacher communication is clear and also insightful in understanding our daughter's personal growth, which is helpful to her growth not only in school but also at home.  The school also organizes monthly field trips that align with its curriculum, which is fantastic because the kids not only learn within a classroom setting but also experience it in a more practical setting.

The services provided by teachers and staff are awesome.. they're so polite,caring,thoughtful towards the kids. I like the concepts of Mindchamp preschool to let kids to explore to new things.., Sending my son to MindChamps TPY is definitely the right move to kick start his school life. He really enjoys everyday in School with dedicated and friendly teachers and all the friends around him. The curriculums are well arranged to enhance not his knowledge but also life skills and confidence. The school also keeps an effective communication channel to keep the parents updated so that we can have a peace of mind. We sincerely recommend all the parents to consider this well established childcare centre for the benefits of your young champions., My Three loving Princess was in the TPY branch. The teachers are wonderful and Caring. Since the day they transfer from other school to MindChamps TPY , I could see their improvement on growing up skills. Languages, good self behaviour attitude and more . Appreciated and grateful thanks the the teachers and teams members on patiently taught on my 3 loving Champs., Our daughter has a great time (over 4 years) at MindChamps TPY. She enjoys the every moment at school. Even during the difficult times of Covid, the school staffs and teachers were doing a great job to ensure all champs‚Äô safety and happiness of studying at school. When coming to graduation, the K2 teachers arranged wonderful day-camp and programs for champs to have a great time. Highly recommended and Thumbs Up üëç !, I had a negative experience with MindChamps. I registered, paid a deposit, and two months' fees to secure a promotional rate during registration. I completed all required forms and waited for my daughter's class to begin in less than two months. However, about two to three weeks after registration, I received a call informing me of a fee increase.  The staff told me that if I do not agree with the increment, I can choose to withdraw and they will refund fully. But this was not what I was initially told during sign-up. I'm aware that I'm not the only parent affected by this.  MindChamps did not honor their promise, and the principal unashamedly mentioned a clause that is ‚Äòallowing them to change terms and conditions without notice‚Äô, which left me stunned.  Their sales tactic was to lock in a special 12-month fee promotion during the special registration period.  I find MindChamps Singapore's actions disappointing and unacceptable. But anyway, thanks to their management, this turned out to be a blessing in disguise for us. I'm extremely relieved that my child is not part of this school.  I personally know a few music teachers working at MC. While I understand that personal lives should generally not be intertwined with one's profession as a teacher working there, I can't help but feel a great sense of relief that my child is not being taught or cared for by certain music teachers., Nurturing and outstanding teachers, exceptional and sound curriculum. Capable management and administration.

Really appreciate the effort from all the teachers and school stuff. good job!, Attended my girl K2 graduation and I have to see it was the best ever!

It was indeed a proud moment for everyone! Well done mindchamps!, Both of my kids went/go to MindChamps Toa Payoh. They enjoyed very much their learning journey and life at the childcare.  The teachers are all very friendly and amiable. You can feel their love of the kids from the moment the kids arriving at the school gate in the morning.

Their commitment to creating a nurturing environment for the children is truly commendable, and we're profoundly grateful for their exceptional care. We would also like to specially mention Teacher Tiffany and Â∞èÊÅ©ËÄÅÂ∏à, whose passion and expertise have significantly influenced our child's development. Furthermore, we valued the inclusive approach that invites parents to participate in school excursions, along with the routine engagement with parents, which we thoroughly enjoy., Musical & K2 Graduation Ceremony - It was a wonderful performance put up by the champs.

Besides, the school's innovative curriculum, teaching methods and most importantly the dedication of the Teachers (constant timely updates and prompt communication/ feedback) in cultivating our child's developmental growth has helped us feel totally assured and confident with trust.

Her dedication to each child's growth is evident in the personalised attention she provides.  2. Teacher Regine's passion for teaching shines through in every interaction. Her creative teaching methods and ability to connect with children make learning enjoyable and meaningful.  Our child has blossomed under their guidance, not only academically but also emotionally and socially. The holistic approach at MindChamps ensures that character development is as important as academic milestones.  In addition, the spacious and well-designed facilities at the center, provide an enriching environment for exploration and discovery.  We highly recommend MindChamps PreSchool @ Punggol Northshore to parents seeking a nurturing and comprehensive early childhood education. Thank you, Teacher Guo and Teacher Regine, for your hard work and dedication!  ---  (This review is based on our personal experience and appreciation for the hard work of Guo Lao Shi and Teacher Regine.), Participating in the 2023 K2 Graduation & Musical Performance as a teacher was a wonderful experience. Being part of the team behind the scenes allowed me to witness the growth and accomplishments of our Champs. The event was impeccably organized, and the joy on the children's faces was priceless. Grateful to contribute to such a memorable celebration. Highly recommend for both educators and parents alike!, I am very grateful to the school for arranging this school visit, which allowed parents to have a deeper understanding of the school life of Champs.  One part of the school visit was the violin and drum performances by the champs. As a parent, I was very excited when I saw my girl performing confidently.  I am glad that I chose the right school for my child so that my child can grow up in such a good learning environment., The school is particular about hygiene, so the environment is clean and the Champs are well taken care of. The teachers go the extra mile to create interesting classes for the students. My child enjoys going to school and I can also see significant improvement in her developments. Grateful to this awesome team, highly recommended!, I‚Äôm so glad to have found Mindchamp for my child. I can be rest assured that she is in good hands. She‚Äôs happy to go to school eveyday to meet teachers and friends. Teachers are caring and welcoming. There are also gourmet, gym and music classes that she looks forward to. The communications are done via app. The teachers reply to questions promptly. There are regular updates with child‚Äôs photos on what have been learned in the classes. Appreciate all the effort and care made by the teachers to give positive school experience and make it enjoyable for the children., The teachers and staffs at MindChamps@Punggol Northshore are responsible, patient and kind. My daughter is welcomed with the warm greetings in the morning and sent out with meticulous care in the evening. I have seen her grow and thrive in this loving environment. Thank you Ms Sonia, Pan Laoshi and all other teachers who take care of my girl, you had made her first year of school so memorable and colorful., Our girl‚Äôs PG to K2 journey in MC Punggol is coming to an end this month and it has been an extremely enriching experience for her. We could see significant improvements in her behavior in the past 2 years and the MC Punggol team deserves a shoutout for it.  Regular updates on our girl‚Äôs development from the app, parent-teacher meetings and quick 5-minute chats with teachers after school has been very helpful as it allows us to ‚Äúcontinue‚Äù the learning with our child at home. Post-Covid, the school began to resume a lot of activities such as farm visits (crocodile, fish, goat, vegetable etc.), excursions (Changi Experience Studio), outdoor activities (Splash @ Kidz Amaze), Sports Day and cultural celebrations to make learning fun and enjoyable at the same time. As parents we also looked forward to taking part in some of these activities with our kids.  The curriculum in my opinion is quite well-balanced and focuses on different areas of development. While preparation for Primary 1 is important, the champs also spend substantial time on learning various musical instruments (violin!), arts and crafts, cultural diversity and outdoor activities to stimulate development in other areas and build up their character.  Our girl was fortunate to be taught by several wonderful and dedicated teachers who are always looking out for her. The principal Veron, form teachers Mr. Tze and Êù®ËÄÅÂ∏à constantly updated us on her meltdowns in school and this helped us greatly in correcting her behavioral issues. Mr. Tze's encouraging and motivating attitude is really ""contagious"" and we could see our girl being influenced positively by him. Êü¥ËÄÅÂ∏à, whom we know so well by now and possibly the active longest-serving teacher there, will personally watch over her whenever she has her bad days and calm her down. Jerome and Katherine have also been proactive in sharing feedback on our girl‚Äôs development in music and reading. Our boy who is in Nursery was assigned to the young and vibrant pair of Â∞èÊÅ© and Tiffany who could match his energy levels and we could feel their genuine attachment to the toddlers under them from their dedication and efforts towards the preparation for the Year-End Musical showcase.  Location wise, the school may not be conveniently accessible but having its own little gym, library, and outdoor playground more than makes up for it. It can be quite a pain during wet weather as the walkway from the main road bus stop to the school is unsheltered.  To sum it up, MC Punggol team really outdone themselves in making the 2 biggest events of the year, the Family Fiesta and the Year-End Musical, a great success. I believe a lot of parents were touched by the performances and proud of their champs. The hours spent on choreographing the dance, rehearsals, handmaking the costumes and props is a testament to the passion and dedication of the whole MC Punggol team under the leadership of Veron. We are really grateful to the teachers who will be departing the school after leading the champs through these milestones in their preschool journey and for the positive impact on them. I would not hesitate to recommend MC Punggol to parents who are looking for a preschool and willing to pay more for the higher education standards and conducive environment.  PS: We were impressed by Sheryl's attentiveness to my dad's condition and for taking the initiative to change my parents' seats for the Musical. Also thanks to Principal Veron for offering the parking space within the school. These small gestures that leave the deepest impression are often overlooked., My girl loves her school at Mindchamps Punggol Northshore. She looks forward to seeing her teachers and her classmates everyday. We always see lots of energy and bright smiles from the teachers and school team! This is so assuring as we know our little one is in good hands. Thanks Ms Veron, Chai Laoshi, Ms Lara, Nana Laoshi, Ms Katherine, Me Jerome, Mr Calvin, Ms Regina, Ms Hanah and all MC Punggol team for making her school experience so enjoyable.  The school organises many fun events like Family Fiesta, learning journey outings, year end musical concert, centre open house experience day etc. The classrooms are so very lovely. We are all impressed by the thoughts that Ms Lara and Nana Laoshi put in for the creative classroom design!  We also greatly appreciate the assistant teachers and the school team's behind-the-scene support in taking care of the Champs. Hui Hui Laoshi does wonders with girls' hair braids (she can totally do a workshop on this!). Sheryl, Hui Yi and Mui Hong are always responsive when we need information. Last but not least, a big thanks to Ms Veron and Chai Laoshi for their passion, dedication and leadership. With principals who love children and education, plus a great team who share the same passion, we believe we will have many more memorable moments for our girl's pre-school journey with MindChamps Punggol., Mindchamps Northshore has effectively organized their classroom to accommodate all lesson materials, and the display of students' handiwork reflects the enjoyment your child experiences at school. Thanks to the efforts of the teachers at Mindchamps Northshore for creating such a positive environment., The MindChamps experience has been very memorable for my 2 children, not only in terms of curriculum but also the enrichment aspects in music, theatre etc so I don‚Äôt have to send my children to other enrichment activities. The emphasis on phonics and hanyu pinyin will greatly help my children in their transition to primary school!, Mindchamps Preschool Punggol is truly a remarkable institution that goes above and beyond in partnering with parents. Both of my kids attended this school from N1-K2, and I am incredibly impressed with the level of support and collaboration they have provided.  Under the guidance of Ms Veron, the principal, the school thrives as a nurturing and inspiring environment, with low turnover rate of teachers. This stability has allowed my kids to form deep connections with their teachers, fostering a sense of trust and support throughout their time at the school. Thank you.  I am grateful to the vice principal, Êü¥ËÄÅÂ∏à. She genuinely cares about the well-being of every child. She was no doubt, my kid‚Äôs favourite person in school! Her dedication I‚Äôve seen for the past 6 years was truly commendable.  I also would like to take this opportunity to give thanks to: Êù®ËÄÅÂ∏à, Mr Tze, Mr Jerome, Ms Katherine, Ms Kat, Ms Elsie, Ms Hui Yi and Mr Kelvin!

Well done, Team Punggol!, A huge thank you to all the teachers and students for making the graduation concert a memorable one! We truly enjoyed every single minute of it. Special thanks to Mr Tze, who has been the pillar of support to both my child and our family from the day we joined the school üòÅ ‚Ä¶, 3 months since my girl in Mindchamps Preschool. Everyday I can see my girl is growing! Nice and safe environment for young child like her.

My girl is currently at Playgroup level, i believe that her class teacher, Ms Nicola and Xie Lao Shi is taking care of her very well as she will be looking forward to school to meet her classmate and both of her teacher even thought she can‚Äôt really talk very well currently.  Kudos for the MC@Punggol Northshore teams! If there is any improvement that I can made comment of it, will be 1) I hope they will be more ‚Äúparents and child day at school‚Äù on some special occasion such as festival celebration/ father‚Äôs or mother day‚Äôs celebration etc. (but to be fair we are only at MC for 3 mths, they might hv planned it on diff occasions)  2) More photo update to parents esp for younger age group as is hard to ask them how‚Äôs their days in sch due to their language aren‚Äôt fully forms yet.  Otherwise I am happy that I have sent my girl to Mindchamps üòå, Hereby to send my heartfelt gratitude to MindChamps Team of inspiring teachers at Punggol Northshore, your dedication to nurturing young minds is truly commendable.

It's a perfect ""finale"" for her life in preschool and looking forward to Pri phase.  My girl joined MC since N2 and she always enjoyed her school. Never I had a problem sending her to class. She has grown to be a confident and well-mannered Champ.  We wanna thank all the teachers, helper teachers, staffs who has poured their lives to make her Preschool journey a fruitful and joyous one.  Special mention to Yang Laoshi, Mr Tze, Ms Katherine, Mr Jerome, Mr Kelvin who make learning so fun and meaningful. Thanks to Ms Veron, Chai Laoshi, Ms Huiyi for taking care and creating a welcoming and positive environment in MC Punggol. All of you are the Mighty Champs too!!!  Thank You MindChamps!, I recently had the pleasure of attending a school tour conducted by the school and I couldn't be more impressed. From the moment I stepped onto the campus, I was greeted with warmth and enthusiasm. The facilities were top-notch, with bright and inviting classrooms and plenty of engaging play areas. What truly stood out, however, was the dedication and passion of the teachers. They not only showcased a deep understanding of early childhood development but also exuded genuine care and excitement for their work. The curriculum presented during the tour aligned perfectly with our family's educational values, emphasizing hands-on learning and fostering a love for exploration and discovery. One particular moment that touched me was seeing my son performance with his friends. Overall, our experience on the tour was great. Look forward to more of such activities in school with my son., I want to extend my heartfelt thanks to Teacher Tiffany, Â∞èÊÅ©ËÄÅÂ∏à, and all the Mindchamps Punggol staff for the incredible guidance and support they have provided to my son during his time at school. He joined in June, and I have already noticed a significant improvement in him. He enjoys sharing his school‚Äôs daily routine and stories about his friends with us when he comes back home. I can truly feel that he is genuinely enjoying his time at school., I am very pleased in this school in terms of the staff, teachers, curricilum, and the environment. We send our 2 kids there and every time we pick them up they will share to us how exciting their day was. Teachers always update us our kid's progress every week. I like how they teach not only in academics but also how they mold the students to be independent and confident. There's so much good to tell about mindchamp northshore., MindChamps @ Punggol Northshore successfully organised a musical yesterday afternoon whereby preschool children from as young as 18 months to 6 years of age performed confidently on a huge stage, with bright stage lights and hundreds of audience! It was really amazing to see these brave young children doing their best on a stage like this. Kudos to the entire staff from MCPN for preparing the children so well. Special thanks to Â®úÂ®úËÄÅÂ∏à, Ms Lara, Ms Regina,  Ms Hanah , Mr Calvin for teaching and guiding my child and to the staff (for instance Principal Ms Veron, Êü¥ËÄÅÂ∏à, Mr Jerome) in the musical core organising committee, well done! Shoutout to the admin team for ensuring a smooth run of the event, particularly Ms Sheryl , who could recognise the parents upon admission. This added a personal touch.  As a parent, it was heartwarming to see my child, not even 3 years of age, singing, dancing and playing a musical instrument on stage! He dressed up in a costume that was partly hand-made by him as well! üëçüèªüëçüèª, I speak from the experience of being a father of two who are attending Mindchamps Punggol Northshore, and this is my honest opinion of the establishment.  Location wise it might not be the most convenient to some, but the environment and infrastructure together with real estate space more than makes up for it. I have been impressed by the general state of cleaniness and hygiene control of the school whenever I visit the place, and the seemingly much lower rates of HFMD/Influenza spreads within the school is probably a good tesitmony of that.  While as with every establishment we cannot expect the quality of every single teacher to be of the highest standard of excellence, I have observed that generally most if not all of the staffs have displayed a good level of understanding with regards to how they should effectively carry themselves in various situations. It is clear that training is prioritized on a management level for that to be achieved (think Hai Di Lao, but for schools).  A huge plus point is it's not uncommon to see staffs who are truly passionate about what they do and enjoy being surrounded by kids. Annoyance or irritation from the staff is an extremely rare sight if any. I am impressed by how most of the staff make the effort to know every child's name and even attempt to build rapport with each of everyone of them. It's comforting to know that there are multiple staffs and teachers who approach their work with their hearts daily.  I do not think this would be possible without the likes of Ms Veron, Mr Jerome and Cai Laoshi (to name a few but there's more), who have definitely helped in creating a healthy culture and environment within the establishment for children to grow and shine in.  I dare confidently say that most children who graduate from Mindchamps Punggol Northshore will enjoy a headstart in their primary school journey. Would highly recommend if cost is not a factor, as I'd see it as a foundational investment in our children and their future., Both my kids are with Mindchamps Punggol Northshore. The teachers are very dedicated and takes really good care of the students wellbeing. Most importantly my kids enjoy school!, Kudos to the teachers for their patience handling young children into school.  It‚Äôs not an easy  task. It's amazing to see the teachers greet the kiddos by their name. Nice to see the progress in my daughter, from a shy to confident girl today.  She shared many happy moments daily about her teachers and friends in preschool., All teachers in Punggol Mindchamps are very warm and put in alot of effort in guiding the students. No regrets at all for putting both my kids there!, Mindchamps Punggol organizes great activity like the Chinatown heritage tour that involves parents with great bonding time with our champs to go through the activities together., Putting 2 of my children here is one of the best decision we have made. My daughter (eldest) has been there since PG till K1 now. Teachers are passionate and genuinely caring. The program is designed to address various aspects, not just academic, this includes musical, gourmet, art & craft and few others.  At the same time, we also want to commend and express our gratitude to the teachers and staffs for the recent Family Fiesta on 1st June. It was thoughtfully planned and executed, both our kids had great fun there!, I'm a parent of 2 kids who are currently in this branch for about 4 years and lucky to have found this branch for our kids.  The branch has a strong curriculum and always has the kids' well-being as their priority. While there is a strong curriculum in place, they also teach based on the class's interest. This is important to sustain kids' curiosity in learning.  For example for N1 classes learning about farm animals, The teachers will hold conversations with the kids and find out their interests. With this, class A would have a slightly different aspect from class B based on their kid's interests. With the opening up from covid situation, they have increased their excursions, such as theatre play, goat farm, crocodile farms as well! The kids enjoyed themselves a lot.  The teachers are dedicated and always go above and beyond their primary responsibility. They always provide timely and valuable feedback on your kids and allow parents to know how they are in school, etc. The principal and admin staff are very responsive as well.  All in all, I would say that this branch is indeed a flagship branch of mind champ where they have a good curriculum, good systems and processes, good teachers, and admin staff.  Do note that not all mind champ branches are the same. After hearing about the experiences that my friends had with other branches. I'm lucky to have found this branch., First time joining the school excursion with my son. It was a fun day at Chinatown. Thank you to all teachers for planning this outing., The year end performance was a delight with the kids putting in their best performance. The school and the teachers put in their upmost effort in making this memorable performance for the kids and parents!, Today's parent workshop affirmed my choice of choosing Mindchamps for my children. Mr Tze and Guo Laoshi has displayed their dedication and professionalism , and shared with me fun ways of reading with my children. GREAT WORK MINDCHAMPS !, I couldn't be happier with my daughter's experience at this MindChamps Punggol . The teachers and staff are caring, creative, and dedicated to providing a nurturing environment for all of the children. The facilities are safe, clean, and well-equipped for learning and play. My daughter has made so many friends and has developed crucial social and educational skills, thanks to the exceptional instruction she has received. I would highly recommend this kindergarten to any parent who wants the best for their child., It‚Äôs the best decision ever to place my daughter in Mindchamps Punggol. Ms Jodee has been very attentive to her needs and is constantly providing us with updates on how she‚Äôs doing in school.  I recall once when my daughter was having a really bad cough. Ms Jodee called and told me that I should bring her to the doctor for early intervention as she felt that something wasn‚Äôt right with the way she was coughing back then.  Thank you Ms Jodee and Ms Veron for holding the ‚Äòfort‚Äô when the working mummies are at work., A big shout out to MindChamps Punggol Team!  I have heard so much about MindChamps and, through a friend‚Äôs referral, decided to enrol my daughter.  The parents‚Äô workshops gave me a deeper understanding of the curriculum and how to support and guide my daughter‚Äôs learning from home. I am now 100% assured of MindChamps curriculum and teachers preparing my daughter for her further learning journey., MindChamps Punggol Team is always responsive to feedback. My happy child is always full of smiles when we pick her up. I attribute this to the exemplary teaching and community feel of the school., It's been a very enjoyable few years at Mindchamps Punggol Northshore, where our child has had a very enriching curriculum taught by very caring teachers.  Ms Huiyi, Mr Jerome, Ms Elsie, Â∞èÈõ®ËÄÅÂ∏à, Ms Nor, Ê¢¶ËÄÅÂ∏à, Ms Katherine, Ms Lash and Mr Kelvin are just some of our child's teachers, whom we would really like to thank for their patience and dedication.  The recent Fiesta was also a great success! It was fun for everyone and encouraged greater bonding among families and friends. Thank you teachers for all the hard work! :), My son has been with Mindchamps Punggol Northshore for close to a year. He has been having a great time and learning a lot.  Thank you to all teachers and staff! ü•∞  We also enjoyed the Family Fiesta Day with the teachers and staffs. It was a great event. Well organized, thoughtful and fun!, Happy and pleased with the school environment, as my boy has been with MC for almost a year, I can say that he has shown progress and improvement on his learning and attitude. Teachers are very patience and friendly as well. My son likes the classroom setting, especially the teachers that he keeps on mentioning at home. Would like to express my thanks to Ms Yvonne, Nana Lao shi for being patient with my son during school time and all the teachers/staffs that are present every morning and evening time during pick up time üòä, My daughter attended Mindchamps Punggol since Playground and she is in N2 now. The teachers are caring and attentive. Senior Principal is experienced. My daughter enjoys and looks forward to school everyday. The curriculum is wonderful and classes are conducted in lively and fun manner but strict when required. The music class conducted is more than learning music and very impressive. A highly recommended preschool!, I am incredibly impressed with MindChamps Pre-School and the exceptional level of care they have provided to my child.  Recently, we had expressed concerns about our child's behavior at school, and the school principal and teachers immediately took action to address our concerns. They were very attentive and empathetic, and we felt heard and understood. With their help, our child has made significant progress in just one month, becoming more self-assured, confident, and happy.  We are grateful for the exceptional level of care and guidance provided by Ms. Si Ying, Li Laoshi, Chai Laoshi, Huihui Laoshi and Mr Jerome and all the other teachers who have played a vital role in our child's development. I also want to give a special shout-out to the school principal Ms Veron for her immediate actions and caring of my child. Her support and involvement were greatly appreciated and have made a significant impact on our child's progress.  The school really cares about every single feedback and takes immediate actions from all the staffs. Overall, we highly recommend MindChamps Pre-School to any parent looking for a safe, nurturing, and stimulating learning environment for their child. Thank you for your dedication and positive impact on our child's growth and development., My 4 year old is enrolled here and waking up for nursery is one of her daily highlights. The teachers and the admin stuff have so much energy and patience for the little ones. It is the details that make this environment stand out. Apart from just nurturing the children, they are equally passionate in guiding us parents through workshops, bite sized info and just heartfelt pointers when we pick our children up. Great educational activities, lovely staff and a huge recommend., My son joined Mindchamps playgroup in March 2023 - he‚Äôs not the easiest nut to crack, he‚Äôs always been a rather sensitive boy, very attached to me and very slow to warm up to new situations, but he very quickly got over the initial tear-filled transition period and fell in love with the school.  These days, seeing him eagerly and excitedly reach for his teachers to baobao / run into the gate in the morning, beaming widely at pickup everyday and speaking fondly of his friends and teachers in school really puts an anxious mother‚Äôs heart at great ease. He‚Äôs truly grown and learnt so much in a short span of 6 months.  An enormous thank you - especially to his 2 main teachers Ms Sonia and Pan Laoshi, enrichment teachers and all other teachers (including Mr Jerome, Ms Hanah, Mr Calvin, Chai laoshi) who have undeniably one by one won my little boy‚Äôs heart over - for giving him the warmth and security and patience and love to help him settle in fully and find a second home in Mindchamps @ Northshore!

He is loving music and I love how MC intergrates Music into the curriculum. My son is also a lot more independent, loving to do things on his own. Thankful to have a supportive team - Veron and all the staffs in MindChamps Punggol for supporting us. Not forgetting my boy's teachers, Teacher Tiffany Âíå Â∞èÊÅ©ËÄÅÂ∏à, Thank you for caring for our son so that we can feel at peace at work.

I had attended 2 workshops - Music and Natural Literacy; where I learnt to recognised scale pattern and musical rhythm (MindChamps unique creation) taught to Champs in music enrichment classes. And, Natural Literacy, where I took away mindful tips in communication with my child.  Goal of the workshops is to encourage and equip parents with know-how to achieve consistent learning with Champs outside of school.  The parents engaging workshops is an initiative by MindChamps Northshore Principal and Teachers as they hope to improve and achieve consistent learning throughout the Champs preschool journey.  Parents engagement to this level is rare. I am appreciative of the Principal ‚Äì Ms Veron and Teachers who constantly create and encourage a good environment for learning to the Champs and parents. I have endless compliments. Thank you for all you do! Looking forward to more engagement program for parents!

We see a lot of efforts being put in by the school in many aspects: keeping the environment clean and safe, ensuring hands-on and interactive learning (both indoor and outdoor), nurturing the child‚Äôs character development, and engaging parents through timely communications, workshops and activities etc.  Its outdoor playground is sheltered, which gives children the opportunity to outdoor play even with unpredictable weather conditions. Excursions and school-learning activities are well-planned, having the children‚Äôs interests at heart is behind the core of the school‚Äôs planning and design for many things.  Most importanly, the school gives a great sense of transparency, and both teachers and staff are caring and nurturing with a passion.

A very big thank you to Ms Veron and everyone at Mindchamps Punggol who have put in relentless efforts to create a safe and conducive environment for the children!, My eldest daughter is of pre-school going age. I was nervous and anxious to ensure that she goes to the best pre-school to equip and prepare her for primary school. With so many choices of pre-school out there I was unsure which is the best for my daughter.  One of the reason why I chose Mindchamps Pre-School@ Punggol is because they offer workshops that parents can attend.  The parent workshop was very informative and explained the challenges faced by pre-schoolers as they transit from pre-school into primary school. In addition to teaching the basic academic skills, the workshop explained how they build the children‚Äôs confidence to face these challenges.  I‚Äôm very impressed by the teachers in recognising that there are more to education than just  academic abilities. A holistic education including building the children EQ and confidence is also required. This puts Mindchamps workshops apart from the other educational providers. It‚Äôs well worth my time in attending the workshop., I‚Äôm Luka‚Äôs Dad and my son has been in MC from the beginning of this year. I‚Äôd really say that the caring and enthusiasm of all the form teachers(Ms Regine, Ms Guo and Mdm Chai) enable my son to be a much more sociable and interactive child who used to be at his own all the time. Despite the fact that my son had made huge progress in both linguistics, math and other aspects, I‚Äôm really grateful that he had a great time and being accompanied by the best teacher group in the world. Thank you MindChamps!, My girl attended Mindchamps since playgroup till now she is K1. We absolutely love the school environment, teachers and school curriculum.  1. School environment Every class has their own classroom which is really important during covid period. The school compound is large, allowing children to move around easily. There are 2 huge playground for the champs to play. My girl loves them a lot. She also enjoys experiencing outdoor learning since they are close to the sea view.  2. Since playgroup, she is blessed to meet very nice and caring teachers who took care of them and see her grow from a little girl who needs to wear diaper to a little girl who is learning how tonuse toilet and now finally she is able to use toilet independently. We are very thankful to her teachers for everything that they have done to make school so fun for my daughter. We are not worry of her attending school as we know that she is in good hands.

It was a fun and great learning experience for parents., My boy has been attending playgroup in Mindchamps Punggol Northshore Center since early Jan. As parent, we are amazed to witness his amazing improvement in terms of behaviours and language development.  We are surprised to see that he is able to say simple words and numbers just after one week attending school and he is able to speak those words newly learned in school. He becomes more and more talkative even greeting strangers in the lift since attending school.  Secondly, we observed that he has developed some good habits. He can return the plates and cups after eating and drinking at home. And when we say wash before having meals, he automatically go to washroom and stand on his stool and open water tap to wash hands. Thanks to school to nurture them be more independent.  Moreover, teachers provides us timely updates in terms of their learning progress, this is also essential for parents to facilitate to enhance their memory and understanding mutually.  Most importantly, we found that he is so excited to go school every single day.

They are pretty professional and efficient to handle all the queries and provide assistance., My son Brayden has been attending Mindchamps Punggol Northshore since PG and I have never regard sending him there. In the past, as the like of many parents with child of 18 months, my wife and I have been searching high and low for a pre-school and Veron has been a star to provide us with a guided tour and  clearly explain the school curriculum which is tailor towards holistic development (SMILES). Looking back, Brayden has developed self-confident, being vocal and learning languages/Counting/Music etc. Of course, all these coaching comes with the care and patient from his teachers!! Kudos to all of them.  The school also have an APP, which provide the parent with temperature checks, attendants, happenings, events, interaction with teachers etc, which makes easy access to updates.  Overall, from my personal view, Mindchamps Punggol Northshore is highly recommended to parents looking for pre-school in North East.  Special thanks to teachers such as Teacher Ana, Zhen Lao Shi and Xie Lao Shi, for part of Brayden learning and growing journey !! Also thanks to Ms Veron who is always readily to support parents who have any question/request., Would like to thanks the teacher for all the effort given to the champ. Was a great experience for my little champ and ourselves. Great job, Really appreciate the teachers putting in time and effort to prepare a class for parents to better understand how they're learning in class as well as to provide ideas and tools to continue student's learning at home. It's a pity this is the first time they've done so though because of COVID. But it's definitely much appreciated. The app recommendation was also great..thank you., Very well planning and good show for young kids to performance so well üëè Good job for Senior Principal & Teachers and Team .üòç ‚Ä¶, Fantastic event and very warm heartening to watch all the kids performing in their most natural ways :), I'd like to affirm the good work that the teachers and staff have done, especially those mentioned below:  Thank you foremost to my son's class teachers - Ms Siying, ÊùéËÄÅÂ∏à, and Ms Huihui. We as parents are well aware that handling a very active and restless child like my son isn't the easiest, but the teachers try their best and are transparent about how they manage and at times discipline him. My special thanks to ÊùéËÄÅÂ∏à - her updates (through phonecalls and chats  during pickup) are always very astute, sharp and insightful. It only goes  to show she isn't just child minding - she is thoughtful about the children's behaviour and tries to interpret what they might mean. It means a lot to me that she takes the time to troubleshoot issues with me, and never once comes across as judgemental. This is so important to a parent.  2) Thank you to the enrichment teachers too - Mr Jerome, Ms Lash, and Ms Hanah. My son comes back telling me all sorts of things he's learnt ‚Äî log rolling in gym class, takadimi rhythm in music class, and spheres (!) in literacy class. It's really funny and heartening at the same time. And he's only 3!  3) And lastly to everyone else - principal Ms Veron, admin staff and the other teachers : thank you for always being welcoming and smiley during drop off (even when us as parents are not! üòÇ). It makes a difference how kids are welcomed.  Thank u Mindchamps Northshore :), My child has been studying here for half a year. He has changed a lot and learned a lot. The teacher is also very caring! The school activities are also very rich, and the children like it very much!, Mr Tze is an energetic and passionate teacher. He is creative and always goes above and beyond to ensure the champs enjoy learning! He has been spot on about my sons challenges despite it being very early into the year and we have tremendous trust that he will push our child to his highest potential. Mr Tze relates to parents very well being a father himself and is always reassuring! We are very lucky to have Mr Tze teach our son this year and hope many other students get to benefit from him !, My daughter has been with MC Northshore for about 2 years already.  Apart from the comprehensive curriculum, healthy and varied meals and conducive learning environment, what impresses me most is the quality of both teaching and non-teaching staff and the way the school is run. My daughter loves her class teachers from now and before and has learnt so much since she started school. All thanks to Ms Nicola, ÈÉëËÄÅÂ∏àÔºåË∞¢ËÄÅÂ∏àÔºåÂ∞èÈõ®ËÄÅÂ∏à, Ms Lash, Ms Regina and Ms Katherine for teaching and nurturing my daughter and her classmates!  Random but commendable point to note - MC Northshore‚Äôs disease/virus control is pretty good. Deep cleaning is done almost after the discovery of a covid case and parents are updated timely on any infectious diseases cases (covid, hfmd, etc)., I was amazed by the Centre Tour @ Mindchamps MCC. The reception was welcoming coupled with the admin staff' friendly and affable attitude. The Principal was knowledgeable, showing intelligence and strong depth of understanding in children's cognitive development in their formative years., Our daughter started MindChamps at Punggol at the start of this year. The teachers here were very patient and my daughter enjoys going to school everyday. Will like to take this opportunity to thank all her teachers in N1G, Ms Si Ying, ÊùéËÄÅÂ∏àÔºå Ms Lash, Ms Hanah, Ms HuiYi, Mr Jerome, XinEn Lao Shi and Ms Hui Hui, not forgetting Principal Veron as well. We can see the confidence in Toni and the progress she's making. She has learnt to be independent as well. She will tell us that she likes Ms Si Ying and ÊùéËÄÅÂ∏à. Teachers are very important in a child's learning journey. We are glad that her teachers had taught her well. Thank you teachers!, My son has been with Punggol Northshore Mindchamp for more than a year since he was 22 months old.  What first made me chose this school is the curriculum of Mindchamp, the good reputation and the school‚Äôs cleanliness & environment.  I am glad to have sent my boy to Mindchamp punggol because I observed how well-run this place is, passionate teachers and how well-thought lesson plans their have.  1. The teachers truly cares for the students through small little actions that I have observed. They are patience, caring and well-trained. My boy feels very comfortable with them. 2. What impresses me is that all teachers receiving and sending off the kids at the reception remember each and every student names! How attentive it is. 3. The principal, Ms Veron runs the school very well. She is hands-on, decisive, attentive, and approachable. She impresses me with how she handles every covid situation - transparent reporting, clear instruction and personally calling parents to follow-up. With her running the school, it gives me assurance.  I strongly recommend Mindchamp Punggol as the school of choice., Love ‚Äúa million dreams‚Äù outstanding performance! Appreciate the teacher and staff million effort!, My daughter has been attending Mindchamps Punggol Northshore since she was 2 years old(PG).  If you are looking for a school with comprehensive curriculum, this is the school that you can consider.  The champs learnt and gained knowledge through enquiry learning, which I think it is a fun way of learning.  Their focus is not only on academic wise, they also build the champs' character, self-esteem, emphasising on mannerism.  There are always timely updates on latest cases on HFMD/Covid on teacher-parent apps, which is really assuring especially when they ensure deep cleaning is carried out each time.  Special thanks to all the teachers that Annabelle has crossed paths with during her learning journey in Mindchamps Punggol, especially her current teachers Ms Elsie and Wang Lao Shi.  Through the committed educators' guidance, Annabelle is a happy, confident, independent child., We sincerely like to thank Ms Veron for giving our daughter an opportunity to join MindChamps PreSchool @ Punggol Northshore, which had made a vast impact on her developmental journey which is extremely important to a young child growth.  As parents, we witnessed our child distinctive improvements on her social interactive skills, speech and language developments within the first 6-months especially in K1.  Lastly, we would also wish to express our deepest gratitudes to all the teachers and Ms Veron support team whom have also helped our daughter through for her developmental milestones journey with MindChamps PreSchool @ Punggol Northshore.  Appreciate and thank you very much., I enrolled my son in Mindchamps Northshore when he was 23 months old. Though his development was slow for a start, it began to improve in leaps and bounds under the guidance of the esteemed team of educators.   My son is blessed with wonderful teachers who provide timely feedback. The curriculum offered by Mindchamps is comprehensive. My son has enjoyed his journey at Mindchamps thus far and is looking forward to the coming days., Wonderful team of teaching staff. My son look forward to school everyday, It‚Äôs a good school with a lot activities, my kid is having fun at school!, I want to special thanks principal and teachers in MindChamps punggol especially Ms Ayu and Ms Ma(chinese teacher) for their efforts and special attention towards my child and also towards all other kids in the school.My child had been with the school for the 2nd year and is so comfortable and cheerful when in school, she also appeared to be happy whenever attending school every morning, she learnt how to speak and also like to sing before going to bed, I known she enjoy her day in MindChamps punggol and before that I had intention to move to the west and try to locate another pre school for my child, but after some careful consideration that she may not have the same feeling and standard in other school so I decided to let her stay and continue her learning development with MindChamps. Thank you so much Ms Veron, Ms Ayu and Ms Ma and all teachers in MindChamps punggol for your care, teaching and attentions to all the kids out there., My son has been with Mindchamps Punggol Northshore since PG,it has been a fruitful learning journey these 4 years. School supported us by equipping him with lifeskills in self management during the early years. With the rich learning from the core and enrichment programme,he truly enjoy himself in the full day programme. He is well taken care of by the team of caring staff and dedicated teachers. Special thanks to all staff and teachers in Mindchamps Punggol Northshore., Â≠ôËÄÅÂ∏à from Northshore Mindchamps has touched us immensely during the difficult period of constant Covid outbursts in the country. Alongside the principal, she would not only call us to show concern when we are unable to send our child, with low immunity, to school, she would send us comprehensive notes of study and slides of the chinese classes missed to ensure our child is able to catch up with the syllabus. All these efforts spent despite her being heavily pregnant. Our English speaking child now sings Chinese songs, recites Chinese poems and is able to recognise and read Chinese words when back home from school. Truly a relief in this duo-language educational system from an academic progress perspective. Most of all, Â≠ôËÄÅÂ∏à has demonstrated the true spirit of an educator every student deserves., I enrolled my son in MC Punggol when he was 22 months old. Four years along the way, he has been blessed with awesome teachers who understand his challenges, strength, and nurture him with great passion and patience.  The facilities in the centre are great too, with a big outdoor playground equipped with slides, castles. There is also one music room and gym room in the centre. My son was encouraged to explore his curiosities to learn Languages, Music, and Sciences. From a shy little boy to a K2 ‚Äúgraduate-to-be‚Äù, we saw how he had grown up with great confidence and happiness. Most important of all, he had built up great relationships with his friends and teachers and interacted with them with love and respect. Big applause to the entire teaching staff and management team in MC Punggol Northshore! Special thanks to Chai Lao shi, Wang Laoshi,Ms. Veron, Ms. Elsie, Ms Ayu, Ms Catherine and many more!, I had the opportunity to visit Mindchamp Punggol past week . Ms Veron the senior principal of the centre was kind enough to show me around. I was enthralled by exburence of centre ..the creativity and imagination of the centre children guided by the dedicated teachers was awesome n .refreshing..Kudos to Ms Veron and the teachers, Teachers are passionate and patient to students. Very happy with sending our child to this school. Thanks Teachers!!, Thank you to every teacher at Mindchamps Punggol Northshore, it's really great! Great centre with friendly and professional staff. The centre is well presented and very clean, the areas for the children have great toys and amazing large outdoor yard., Massive campus with big classrooms to facilitate learning. Huge outdoor playground and surrounded by the shoreline and greenery that makes learning a lot more engaging., Highly rated center where teachers go over and beyond and kids benefit from the nurturing culture. The champs grow up to be confident and vocal with a never-give-up mindset., A Great workshop that allowed me to learn more creative ways to teach my child, and for my child to build more interest in storytelling. A different way of learning through storytelling as well., A frustrating ordeal for me to simply have my deposit balance refunded after my son‚Äôs withdrawal on 31 Dec 2022. Admin keeps on saying will call us back but no one called and no update. Had to call HQ and again told me to wait for another 7 days.  I‚Äôve had my share of ups and downs with this preschool., Best choice of preschools in Punggol - enrolled my boy into it since his PG and the school has been nurturing him with good care and their best-in-class curriculums. A fun, fruitful and enjoyable learning experience for preschoolers."
MindChamps Chinese PreSchool @ Thomson,"Switched my child when she was in N2 for the main reason of exposing her to Mandarin. Overall, the school provides a nurturing and stimulating environment. Teachers are knowledgeable, patient, and creative, ensuring that every child receives individualized attention and support. The curriculum is engaging and age-appropriate, promoting holistic development. Communication with parents is excellent, fostering a strong partnership between home and school.  There is some room for improvement as I do note the high turnover rate of the staff. Overall, Mindchamps Thomson is a wonderful place for children to learn, grow, and thrive. My child loves school and looks forward to the lessons, My daughter (now in K1)  has been at this school since playgroup and my son just started playgroup this year. Enrolling my son was an easy decision seeing how my daughter has blossomed over the years at mindchamps. The smaller class sizes ensure that students get personalised attention from teachers, who are truly invested in their learning. Lessons, while conducted within the theme/topic for the term,  are nonetheless adjusted to the children‚Äôs interests, ensuring that the children remain excited to keep on learning. Indeed, the teachers make mindchamps special. It is clear from conversations with them that they are extremely dedicated to their craft and caring for the children, not just the children in the class they teach but the children across all levels. My son‚Äôs current teacher, who also taught my daughter in her nursery years, still interacts with my daughter regularly and provides me with feedback. My daughter‚Äôs teachers are also constantly looking out for my son and providing me with updates on how he is adjusting to school. I‚Äôm ever grateful and thankful to my mindchamps village for providing such a safe and loving environment for my children to learn and grow. The school has certainly gone through rough patches with higher teacher and principal turnover. But the teachers that remain are true gems and I sincerely hope the administration does everything they can to retain the teachers and provide greater and longer term stability., This preschool has inept, unresponsive franchise owners, whose poor management has caused high staff turnover and distrust from many parents.  Our child was with MindChamps Thomson Chinese Preschool for K1 and K2, graduating in 2023. We chose this school as we wanted a Mandarin-immersion programme near our home. While our child had good teachers throughout the two years there, unfortunately, the school was very poorly managed. During this period, 4 principals resigned (the 5th principal will be starting in late-Jan 2024), along with all 6 of our child‚Äôs teachers.  What is worse is that these 6 teachers left with little to no notice period given to the parents or children. This is despite the management being aware that they resigned several months ahead of time. They deliberately required the teachers not to tell the parents, giving no time for a proper farewell and showing little regard for the relationship between the teachers and the children. The school environment was therefore very unstable, making it difficult for children to form a relationship of trust with their teachers. Just imagine how your child would feel if they started trusting a teacher, only to see her suddenly depart, time after time.  During the first wave of resignations in 2022, we were among a group of 9 families who collectively wrote a letter to the franchise owners to express our grave concern. We were deeply dissatisfied with the high staff turnover and their decision to announce the teachers‚Äô departure at very short notice (i.e. 1 day before her last day). Notably, the owners did not bother to respond to us at all. Instead, the new principal tried to assure us she would right the ship. She worked hard and seemed sincere, but soon resigned as well. While we certainly considered changing school, eventually we kept our child there because of the existing friendships and the new teachers were good. It‚Äôs also rather disruptive to change school with just a year to go.  The K2 year was more stable ‚Äì we thought the management had finally met minimal standards. Unfortunately, that was not to be the case.  In mid-December 2023, both the K2 teachers left the school abruptly. Once again, the management kept the news from us until 3 days before the teachers‚Äô final day. This was baffling, given that the parents had already paid the school fees for December, so they could have given more time to allow the children to process the end of these treasured relationships.  From these actions, it is clear that the franchise owners of MindChamps Thomson are lacking in management and people skills. Worse, they do not listen to feedback. Principals did not stay more than 6 months, they could not explain the decisions of the franchise owners, and good teachers left very suddenly, in an unnecessarily disruptive manner. We have no confidence in the franchise owners, and believe parents should know about their history before deciding to enrol.  Ultimately, while the teachers are good and committed, the preschool management is not child-centric. Here is a final example: MindChamps Thomson scheduled the K2 graduation concert on 3 December, obviously to get parents to pay for that month‚Äôs enrolment. Several families planned to travel in Dec to visit family overseas etc and thus appealed to have the concert earlier. However, the management rejected the appeal. As a result, several children were not allowed to join the graduation concert, even if their parents were willing to pay the $373 concert/graduation package. This is simply mean and profit-obsessed. Most other preschools hold their graduation concerts in November, and even October.  We think teachers, parents and children deserve much better., My wife and I couldn't be happier with our experience at Thomson MindChamps Chinese Preschool! Our first born has been attending for several months now, and we have been consistently impressed with the quality of care and education provided. The teachers are all incredibly dedicated, knowledgeable, and patient, and they truly go above and beyond to make sure every child is thriving. Our child has learned so much during their time at the preschool, from Mandarin language skills to socialization and problem-solving skills. We also appreciate the emphasis on play-based learning and hands-on activities. The facilities are clean, bright, and well-equipped, and the communication with parents is excellent. Overall, we would highly recommend Thomson Chinese Preschool to any parent looking for a nurturing, enriching, and fun environment for their child's early education., I wanted what is best for my first born that this why I never hesitate to bring him to MindChamps. I have heard a lot of positive reviews about this center and I wanted to see for my self. Facilities are indeed child friendly and conducive for learning.  They have this systematic scheme that the child would be learning and enjoying because they thought that they were only playing. Teachers are also fun loving too. My child really enjoys to follow what his teacher sings and dances. That is worth of every dollar I spend., Kids learn faster than adults and, being 50% Chinese, I believe it is essential that our children be exposed to the Chinese culture and language early on. This will enable them to tap into the advantages of being proficient in one of the most widely spoken languages in the world today.  We were concerned initially whether our child would feel overwhelmed being thrown into a new environment with a new language. However, young children adapt quickly and before we knew it, he started acquiring new vocabulary and was responsive when I communicated with him in Mandarin.  Since he started attending school at MindChamps Chinese PreSchool @ Thomson, he learned many words, both in Mandarin and English. He can converse with a basic level of understanding and enjoys the songs and stories in both languages. I'm very much satisfied with the learning we got from MindChamps., MindChamps guarantees  Quality Preschool Education that my child deserves. At the age of 4, he can speak fluently all because his teacher is so dedicated to let my child learn without pressuring him to do so. Play is also a part of their curriculum and I am happy that my child is having best childhood memories at MindChamps., The Office Was So Beautiful In The Inside!ü•∞üòò ‚Ä¶"
MindChamps PreSchool @ Holland Village,

MindChamps PreSchool @ JTC Summit,
MindChamps PreSchool @ Fusionopolis,"Very grateful for MC teachers and admin team for their support and dedication given to the kids ! My child entered from a crying child to a child looking fwd to going to school daily, Extremely caring  teachers. Kids are all so well taken off and always happy. A good foundation for kids., Great curriculum and caring teachers! Regular updates provided and most importantly my child is happy ! Thank you MindChamps Fusionopolis !, Great school with good facilities. My kids had learnt alot during their time there., Good school near my office. Teachers are warm and kind, not to mention who but the teachers in this school does not deserve the price we pay for. When my child was in N1 ,my child peed on his pants while sleeping ( the school said that must let the students learn how to sleep without diaper ) and sleeps in the aircon room fro two hours. May i ask what for training them and letting them fall sick at such a young age ? When he go to N2 , he was scolded again for that once peeing on his pants and he was gloomy for the rest of the day and did not participate in any activities , the teacher also did not care and just let him stand at aside , excuse me ? aren't you suppose to encourage him ? Plus can teachers not point finger at students ? it is rude . thank you, Dedicated teachers and great curriculum!"
MindChamps PreSchool @ Paragon,"Amazing teachers with so much heart and caring mindset. It's wonderful seeing our daughter get excited to go to mindchamp. The teachers really make an effort to engage the kids and develop them in an individualised way. The school is committed to providing a safe, fun and loving environment and we are thankful to Shermaine(principal), Ms Cammy and Han Lao Shi and of course the rest of the awesome teachers at Paragon Mindchamp. WE do observed the development in our daughter and planning to send our son too. Keep up the good work :-), We are glad to have found such a tight-knit, loving first school for our daughter. She enrolled to PG and settled in quickly, alleviating a lot of our worries as very sticky first time parents.  She speaks of Ms Jac, Yang Laoshi, Ma Laoshi, Ms Shermaine, Ms Fiqah, Ms Nadia and her time at school with a huge grin on her face. Teachers and staff are always very responsive and pleasant in our communications.  She's learned a lot during her short time at MindChamps, and is growing to be an independent young lady. We look forward to the next year!, It‚Äôs been a wonderful experience for us to see our daughter learn, develop herself and bond with the Mindchamp Paragon family. We are truly grateful for all the teachers -Ms Jacq, Ma Laoshi, Yong Laoshi, and more - who have dedicated to our daughter the level of care, love, and attention that we could only wish for. Ms. Jacq‚Äôs leadership throughout has been very strong, and critical to her development. She has been able to build deep bonds with the school, and we are very grateful to everyone! PS. very special thanks to the entire staff for expertly handling all our daughter‚Äôs allergies!, We moved our daughter to Mindchamps Paragon when she was entering N2 due to some unpleasant experience with another Mindchamps branch. We were very sceptical at first, but Ms Shermaine (principal) has shown not only her professionalism and expertise in her field but also her ability to understand each champ character and challenge.  We re very impressed with Ms Cammy and Han Lao Shi for being very attentive, passionate, caring , and firm in the same time to our daughter.  She enjoys going to Mindchamps Paragon and loves her friends and Teachers.  Our daughter enjoys learning and showing tremendous growth on her study and character., Our experience with Mindchamps has been great! Ms Shermaine and the PG teachers (Ms Jac, Yong Laoishi and Ma Laoishi) really care about the champs and are amazing. They are attentive, caring, highly qualified and responsible. They also tailor the learning experience based on the champs need and preferences. Thank you for taking care of our little one! We are grateful and appreciative of everything you do., My twin kids joined the amazing school since K1 when we come back from China. We made decision to let kids in because their professional education experience especially from headmaster Ms. li, Sherlyn and teacher Bingbing. They know how to let kids learn what they need based on a friendly, respectful,and happy relationship.[ÊØîÂøÉ], We deeply appreciate MindChamps as a preschool where our kids learned, had fun, and made friends! The teachers go above and beyond to make sure each and every Champ develops. A big THANK YOU to teachers Leong Laoshi and Kaysee for taking care of our youngest son Quentin this year!, We are so grateful for the love and care teachers have given our toddler in playgroup. She went as a little 18 month old and is now confident , speaking fluently and a little lady. Ms Jaq, Ma Laoshi and YangLaoshi thank you for the love and care you have shown our daughter., Dedicated teachers and wonderful facilities. A great environment for kids to learn and play. My daughter absolutely adores coming to school. I highly recommend this preschool!, Eliza attended Mindchamps Paragon from PG to K2. We witnessed how she achieved many great milestones along her PS Journey and unleashed much of her potential through the all rounded, multi faceted programmes that inspire, educate and empower her as a mindchamp! All Her teachers and the principal Showed great dedication and heart to nurture and groom her! Kudos and continue to shine like diamonds and be an inspiration to all the champs! üíé Gambatte!, Ms. Jac, Yang Lao Shi and Ma Lao Shi have been phenomenal in nurturing and educating my child at kindergarten. Their blend of professionalism, creativity, and cultural inclusivity fosters a love for learning. We've seen remarkable growth in my child's confidence and skills. They're truly exceptional educators and mentors."", Sending my children to MindChamps Paragon is easily one of the best decisions I‚Äôve made as a parent. The school is located in a convenient and accessible location - a plus point if you don‚Äôt have a car. The heart of the preschool is really the teachers. They are passionate, caring, patient and loving, and not once have I had to worry about my children‚Äôs well-being or safety. It is a wonderful, warm and safe haven where children are engaged in a structured but purposeful way. My kids always leave the school smiling and happy, and that to me, is the best testimony of a good preschool., I want to share my experience for the past few months with MindChamps Paragon.  Some background of my son, who is turning five this year. He has been attending an International school in Brunei since he was two and a half years old before returning to Singapore on the 31st of November. The school with huge compounds, three canteens, excellent facilities, and large playgrounds, even just for kindergarten level.  When he was in the international school, he was neutral, neither eager nor enthusiastic about school. During covid lockdown, he didn‚Äôt care whether he would be going to school the next day or not.  After returning, I decided to enroll my son in Mindchamp Paragon. At first, I wasn‚Äôt very optimistic due to the limited area to play compared to the international school in Brunei. But this is what it is when we are in a scarce land city-state.  As I would like my son to master his mandarin better, at home, we are only allowed to converse in mandarin as I would want my son to master at least in his mandarin speaking.  During the enrolment, I specifically emphasized to the Teachers to encourage my son to speak more mandarin to him instead of English.  To my surprise! After the first day of school, my son loves going back to MindChamps Paragon. Every day, even on weekends, without fail, he will ask me if there‚Äôs school tomorrow. He had shown so much interest in going to school that he did not have that enthusiasm in his previous school.  After the first week of attending Mindchamps paragon, he has improved his mandarin speaking.  In the following weeks, my son has shown significant improvements in his eagerness to write and draw, which he has lack of previously.  Besides, the teachers went above and beyond to ensure the children were comfortable and well taken care of. This is the first time I have seen such a high level of dedication by the teachers, especially Fan Laoshi, Ms. Cammy, and Ms. Lee.  After a long absence from lockdown, when school reopens, toddlers will typically take about a week to accept and adjust to new environments and routines. What took my son a week in the previous school, in mindchamps paragon, only one day.  To my surprise, he was eager to go back to school the following day without the first day crying drama or pleading to go home, etc.  It‚Äôs such a pity that we will be relocating again in the coming month. If it weren‚Äôt for relocating, we would be glad to continue with mindchamps paragon as long as the highest level mindchamps provides...  My son and I are going to miss this excellent school!  Thank you so much, teachers, for your dedication and efforts to create a positive learning environment for the children.  Thank You So Much !, Love how this school is a complete balance of learning, exploring and fun! My boys love going to school. Thanks for helping them grow ‚Äúsmarter‚Äù(quote from my son) üòÑ. ‚Ä¶, We truly love this school that my son goes to since he was 2.5 years old. He had a cheerful, caring and wonderful teacher named Miss Azizah in his early years. She played an important role shaping and guiding my son to be who he is today i.e a very positive, confident, smart, kind, loving little man :) He also had a sweet and attentive Chinese teacher named Pei Pei Laoshi, that took extra time to teach him Chinese cause he wasn‚Äôt very good at it. Then later he had Mr Jay who is just as caring and wonderful as his first teacher. Mr Jay is a very generous and kind hearted soul. Have a talk with him and you can see how passionate he is about kids and teaching. I highly recommend this school for the teachers that are the main building blocks for our children‚Äôs future. Do give thanks to them when they have done a great job! We need to give praise and recognition to such awesome teachers!, Our family is new to Singapore. Before we applied to the school, Principal Shermaine is so helpful and willing to answer our questions. I am grateful that the children met so many friendly teachers in Mindchamps Paragon, especially Mr Jay, who takes good care of the children and is enthusiastic about his work. My daughter said he is the best teacher ever! My heartfelt thanks to every teachers in this school., Ms Shermaine is a very responsible and dedicated preschool principal. She puts efforts in understanding every champ‚Äôs habits and behaviours both in school and at home, thus as a parent I feel that communication with Ms Shermaine and the teachers has been a good experience so far. The teachers are also professionals in early childhood education who take care of children with fairness and tender loving care. My daughter is happy to go to school and she likes to share with me what she learned in school every day. Thank you Ms Shermaine and the Teachers!, Mindchamps Paragon has been a safe and nurturing environment for my son since 2019. He will graduate this year and we are sure he will miss all the kind and caring teachers & staff @ Paragon, also his classmates for the last 4 unforgettable years! We are extremely pleased with this investment we have made for his future. The camaraderie forged with the other parents is also invaluable., Both my girls attended Mindchamp @Paragon. One graduated in 2015 and the youngest one graduated in 2022.  Every day when I sent them to school, they are always hopping into the school with a smile. And on non-school days, they would tell me that they missed school. At the end of the day, they are always eager to share with us what they had learnt/ what they did in school. And their sharing sessions are always full of excitement. And all these are signs to tell us how much they had enjoyed their pre-school journey!  Their positive preschool experience will not be made possible without dedicated teachers. I would like to thank the teachers, especially Mr Jay for their patience, constant encouragement, creativity and love for my kids.  Thank you for making a great difference for the children. Because you care for them, you have directed them to trust themselves in all they do and to become all that they dream., My son started his K1 @Mindchamps Paragon. We notice his progress in writing, reading & spelling for both English & Chinese. Mr Jay (K2) and Pei Pei Laoshi (K2) were his teachers that make huge positive impact. The teaching dedication is outstanding. Last but not least, my son also made alot of good friends. We are quite happy to have him at Mindchamps during his pre school years., Our son has been going here since December and I have to say within a couple of weeks of being here he started learning to count, started saying the days of the week and also started to communicate his needs better. The teachers are attentive and really care about toddler overall development. The way they design the curriculum is so impressive and I am so happy that we chose this school for my toddler. The teachers‚Äô frequent communication with the parents about the toddler‚Äôs development is also something we really appreciate. Thank you teachers!, How to begin .. I can honestly say that we ( me and my son ) both miss Mindchamps very much. Liam practically grew up with this preschool since he was before 2 years old. From PG to K1 .. We appreciate the attentiveness that most of the Teachers give to the Champs professionally and the time they took to brief us every single day during pick up time. Some teachers would do the extra miles to attend to champs with special needs and to be able to understand that each house hold is different. Their roles at school were as equally important as mom‚Äôs roles at home, they are giving knowledge and implanting discipline that sometimes parents failed to do at home. We are VERY grateful for the Teachers. I apologize if I missed some names but I honestly hope that it won‚Äôt affect any of their good dedications and caring, from Miss Eunice, Wu Laoshi, Fan Laoshi, Miss Bev, Miss Cam, Ms Cleris, Ms Nadia, Ms Jasmine, Mr Jay .. even the previous Ah Yis who used to work there at PRG. I hope the COMPANY can further notice all of Teachers contributions and dedications to the children, can appreciate and care for the Teachers as well, since they play the most important roles in the school ( brand ) development and champs qualities. Nevertheless, we are thankful., My kid has been attending classes at Mindchamps for the past one year and I have been really impressed with the school! The entire experience has been positive - from the student-teacher ratios, to the attentiveness of the staff and also the school‚Äôs thoughtful approach in managing safety - everything has been top notch. I‚Äôll be sending my younger kid here for sure! Keep up the good work., Both of my girls went to mindchamps preschool paragon at 18 mth old. Apart from the comprehensive academic curriculum and the clean, neat, safe environment, the teachers we have encountered were amazingly patient, committed and caring. I must say I was totally worry-free when my girls were left to the care of the Mindchamps teachers, even during Covid period. A special thanks to my second daughter‚Äôs K2 teacher- Mr Jay, for going the extra miles to care for the kids and even arrange play dates for the graduating class during the holidays. Mindchamps Preschool (Paragon), highly recommended üëçüèª, We have nothing but G R A T I T U D E!‚ô•Ô∏è‚ú® Grateful for all the Teachers(Ms Cammy,Fan Laoshi,Mr Jay,Ms Fiqah,Ms Nadia,Ms Jasmine and Miss Shermaine!) Our kid is on remission and it hasn't been easy for us to just leave him in school especially on a full day basis.We thank each and everyone who made Zen's journey an enjoyable one.Since he went to Paragon(coming from Chinese Pre-School at Cecil) he maintains the same level of enthusiasm and he loves his teachers dearly,esp Fan Laoshi and Mr Jay.Thank you for caring for Zen and for always giving us updates on diseases that's been going on in the school.(we are very particular since Zen's immune system is not that strong due to his history.But he's much better now!Fully recovered and enjoying life to the fullest!) Im sure his childhood memory bank is full of happy memories with you all there.üíï  We would also want to commend everyone who taught the kids during their ""I'm Proud of You "" Champs Fest, we can see how confident and comfortable they were on stage even without teachers teaching the steps in front of them.We are also proud of you Teachers of Mindchamps PARAGON!üëèüèªKudos everyone üëèüèªüëèüèªüëèüèªüëèüèªüëèüèª, My kid enjoyed her N1 class but when she got to N2, things changed. She became annoyed and kicked up a fuss for going to school every morning. Caring and nurturing had deteriorated significantly at the N2 class. She was scolded and ridiculed repeatedly for not being able to write proper Chinese characters. My kid left the Paragon school and now attends another preschool. The change was so drastic. She now looks forward to having school days.  The quality of teachers was not consistent. It was good at N1 but became inferior at N2. The moment your kid consistently dreads about going to school, you know something isn‚Äôt quite right., I can still remember the time when I was trying to find the best preschool in Singapore for my then two-year-old boy. I visited a few schools, but none could beat the ‚ÄúThis is the right one‚Äù feel of MindChamps PreSchool at Paragon. The school was brimming with positivity and light.

She often gives us surprises, for example, keeps her own toys, asked for permissions to do certain things, know how to be kind or apologize when something goes wrong, speak proper sentences, able to share her toys and food‚Ä¶ etc  On top of that, the school activities also help her to further develop the mind, writing her very first alphabet and initiate to sit at one corner to flip the books and using her little fingers to go through all the sentences. We did not imagine our active child who just turned 3-year-old, is capable to do all these by herself.  We look forward for more of her good character being build up in this school.  We would like to thank all the teachers for your patience, effort and also your unconditional love and care for her., We‚Äôve been with MindChamps Kinex for 5.5 years. The principal and teachers have been very helpful and sensitive to my children‚Äôs needs, and have gone beyond their duties to groom and nurture them. The principal and teachers also guided my husband and I on methods we could use at home to encourage positive behaviors. My eldest have matured emotionally over the years, and this wouldn‚Äôt have been so without the help and support from the team at MC Kinex! Thank you! ‚ù§Ô∏è, I would definitely recommend MindChamps Kinex to families and friends with kids. The principal and team are very professional and hands on with the kids. My little one started school with them when she turned 18months.  Ms Christina, Ms Neesha and Xu lao Shi did a fabulous job in easing the little one into school. My wife and I get daily updates on the progression and photos of the little one via the school‚Äôs app.  The working relationship between parents and Teachers aren‚Äôt limited to school issues, the team of Teachers also check in with parents on the child‚Äôs behaviour and habits at home. This enables the team of teachers to better understand the little one. The Teachers also share with parents what is taught and enforced in school such that parents can try doing so at home.  Mindchamp Kinex has many activities and hands on learning opportunities for the kids. We are happy to see the development and improvement of our little one given that she only started school for 3 months.  Thank you very much to the principal and Teachers for guiding and teaching our little one. We were fortunate to have enrolled her into mindchamp Kinex., As a new mother, I was apprehensive about sending my son to school. At 18 months, he‚Äôs a bit rowdy and not less than what I would consider obedient.  Wasn‚Äôt sure how the schools, especially the teachers would be able to handle him.  Coming close to 6 months now, I am very happy with the experience in MindCamps @ OneKM.  The teachers there are very good with kids and have consistent technique to manage various situations.  Management is also responsive and patient to adddress our concerns.  Overall, happy to see my son learning and enjoying himself in school., I highly recommend MC at Kinex, where my two sons have been attending for about a year. Having had bad experience at two other private preschools before this, my family and I are relieved to finally find a preschool that my boys enjoy attending while we are at work.  Under the strong leadership of Mrs Koh, the team of teachers work together with great synergy and a common vision. As such, the ‚Äúattrition rate‚Äù among teachers seems to be pretty low compared to other schools we have been to. The teachers are passionate, patient, caring, yet firm. We are grateful to all the teachers who spent much effort keeping the children safe (during covid19) and helped the boys to progress in their development. Special mention to Ms Hidayah and Hui Laoshi who went over and above their duties in guiding my boys. Thank you!, We are so lucky to have found MindChamps@one km. Dedicated teachers who not only take care of my girls and correct bad behaviors, but also genuinely have fun with them in the process. I like that the teachers are transparent and always welcome parents into school. My kids are comfortable with any of the teachers, not just with their own class teachers. Turnover ratio of the teachers is also low. Plenty of events and excursions in one year with a sleepover during children‚Äòs day. I‚Äôm not endorsing the MindChamps brand, just endorsing the team behind this particular preschool., We were strongly recommended by our good friend to send our 2 year old toddler to Mindchamps PreSchool @ KINEX (East Coast). Our friend has 3 kids herself and they all attended Mindchamps PreSchool @ KINEX (East Coast) too. She told us that Mindchamps PreSchool @ KINEX (East Coast)stood out from all other preschools due to the dedicated teachers who have been with the centre and school principal for many years. Indeed the PG Teachers have been very caring, patient and attentive towards my son and his classmates.  Personally, it was not a easy decision to send our very young son to a preschool in the first place. After all, he will be spending many hours in the preschool and it will definitely have an impact on his behaviour and development. Luckily, a high quality preschool like Mindchamps PreSchool @ KINEX (East Coast) have brought about positive outcome for my son. My son is a well-adjusted child who enjoys going to school and likes spending time with his Teachers and friends. Thank you Mindchamps Teachers for looking out for my son KJ! Really appreciate it!, I sent my daughter to MindChamps Kinex when she was just starting K1. Prior to MindChamps Kinex, my daughter was attending another childcare centre for her N1 & N2 years. The teachers were very patient and understanding. They helped my daughter to transit into a different environment with ease. She used to dislike going to school but ever since attending MindChamps Kinex, she looks forward to her lessons every day. On top of that, there were huge improvements in her academically. She can read and write very well. Her Mandarin improved tremendously too. Lastly, the teachers are very prompt in their communication and the centre, helmed by Mrs Koh,  is very orderly and well organised. I am most impressed with the well thought out curriculum and its efficient delivery method during the Circuit Breaker period. All in all, I highly recommend MindChamps Kinex to all parents!, My child has been in this school since PG. All the staff and teachers have been great. We always felt comforted knowing our child is in good hands. Teachers are caring and communicate to us regularly regarding our child's progress. A big thank you to everyone at  Mindchamps Preschool@East Coast., Started my boys at kinex mindschamp since 2019. Amazing experience with caring and effortful teachers and staff. Special shout out to Ms Camille and Feng Lao shi and ms yeo! Very personable and staff cares alot for each child. Strongly recommend!, My Child experience was good in past few years. Teachers are very caring, lovely and patient. Hope will continue in the future., Great teachers at MindChamps PreSchool @KINEX- professional and pleasant.  My child has been with them since PG, and with continued encouragement from Mrs Koh, his principal, I have seen positive emotional growth in him over the years.  Not only has he blossomed in terms of his confidence, the way he interacts with his friends, also being able to express himself. Highly recommended school!, First class teachers and management team. Lauren progression went beyond our expectations within a short span of 2 years. She absolutely loves school now. Also communication is great as the parents are always updated. Besides in house learning, lots of outdoor activities to keep the kids constantly engaged. A peace of mind when your kids are with MindChamps. Thanks you!, Our 2 kids have been with MindChamps East Coast since they were 18 months old. As with most other kids, the first few months were very stressful as the kids were wailing and crying when we send them to school. The teachers and principal handled the situation well and we were informed constantly of our kids‚Äô progress and also discussion were held to evaluate how we can best overcome the kids‚Äô reluctance to go to school. We appreciate the attention that has been given to our kids and applaud the dedication that team of teachers has demonstrated that is led by Mrs Koh., Think no more if you are considering MindChamps East Coast to enroll your child. Both my children are attending this preschool and I have absolutely nothing to complain about. Teachers are attentive and prompt to update, low turnover rate and care for the children with big hearts. I go to work with peace of mind knowing my children are well taken care of by this stellar team., I love this PreSchool. Teachers are experienced, friendly, committed and very innovative! The outdoor playground is great and even better when it gets converted to water play at times! My son is outspoken and academically well. The teachers have taught him well. He learns responsibilities, manners and patience. Most of all, he is happy and loves attending school!, Wonderful preschool! My first child has spent 3 year here since we moved to Singapore. He is still missing the preschool and teachers although he is in primary school now. Teachers are experienced and patient. They not only took good care of my child, but also got him well prepared for his next journey in primary school. We will send our second baby to this school soon. I would like to say THANK YOU to the principle and teachers for their great efforts and excellent job!, I would highly recommend Mindchamps Kinex to any potential parents looking for a holistic preschool for your child. The outdoor play area is great for the kids to get some sun and run around. The teachers are kind and caring. The principal helms the centre efficiently and is friendly yet professional with parents. What I especially like is that Mrs Koh emphasises on the importance of discipline and having good moral values and not just on academics.  The teachers did a great job during the circuit breaker and went above and beyond their call of duty to ensure the charges under their care were still learning from home and having fun. The mgmt has taken many steps to ensure the children are safe and happy in school given the current constraints. Kudos to the team at Kinex!, Thank you to the teachers in Mindchamps @ One KM. I noticed that my child, Leanne has improved so much when it comes to her learning. I know her achievements today are because of your dedication and passion. Really appreciate that the teachers actually take time to speak to me regarding Leanne's ability to focus in class (glad that it is better now), correcting bad behaviours and picking up on little things that we as parents do not notice at home. I love how the teachers always come up with ideas for school activities, excursions and bringing the children out for musicals and plays. Of course, not forgetting the signature sleepover event... Thank you so much for partnering us in nurturing the child‚Äôs future! It feels good to know that my child is learning and growing in an environment like this, It is my second year here, but I have witnessed the teachers' dedication and love in teaching the children. Thank you and may you continue the good work!, We love this PreSchool. Both my children are here from PG to K2 and never once do we have to worry if they would be mistreated or whatsoever at school because the teachers here are experienced and delicated. The outdoor playground is huge and there is water play from time to time. Both my children started off shy and reserved but the teachers managed to help them build up their confidence till they moved on to Primary school as confident individuals. We are so grateful to the teachers here who helped us mound their character so well. They learnt responsibilities, to care and to share. Most importantly, both built up a deep love for attending school, they both were happy and loves attending MindChamps to the extent that they just wish they can turn back time and stay on as babies. Thank you, MindChamps East Coast (OneKm - Kinex)., Both my kids are with mindchamps@onekm. What makes the school special is that it has a strong sense of family. The bigger kids would help the little ones and they have friends across levels. The main teachers are also with the school for a long time. Been with the school for the past 5 years, we have become friends with the teachers and some of them taught both my kids. The kids are not only well prepared for p1, they are also exposed to current affairs and values (eg. The recent Thai cave incident was discussed in class). Thank you teachers for all the efforts and going the extra mile to create special moments for the kids!, Our children (K2 and N1) are with Mindchamps Preschool @OneKM, or Kinexis, both started at 1.5yrs. They loved every bit of it and looked forward to school every morning, as they never complained about having to attend school. We've seen how well they progressed over the years and we are very pleased to have made this wise choice. We'd highly recommend Mindchamps Preschool to parents who prefer a more holistic approach to teaching and learning. This is particularly important to nurture lifelong interest in learning and to help my children cope with the world ahead of them. Besides, we are also happy with the activities-filled curiculum, perhaps that is the reason why our kids were often entusiatics learning new things. The teachers are always helpful, patient, kind and cheerful, which never failed to amaze us with their passion and dedication to their job. Kudos to the Principal Mrs Koh who did a fantastic job! Definitely a big thumbs up for them and should no.3 come along, we wouldn't hesitate but stick to Mindchamps! If there is only one thing to ask: please stay affordable... üòÅ, My two kids each had 4 good years of care and education at the preschool. It first started out in a little homely corner along East Coast Road with a great team of teachers. The principal Mrs Koh is always jovial and full of energy. There are many fun events with the support of the teachers and PSG. The teachers are also attentive to the needs of the kids. Thank you for the great memories!, We enrolled our son with Mindchamps Kinex during the circuit breaker through a friend‚Äôs recommendation and we never looked back. We were apprehensive initially because of the timing that we enrolled our son, but that quickly dissipated. The school took social distancing and personal hygiene very seriously, requiring the children to wash their hands frequently. They even specially sourced a face shield for them. Pre-covid days, the parents were able to sit in with their child during the first week of school for a smooth transition.  This was something we couldn‚Äôt do. Rachel understood our anxieties and for the first week, she attached Miss Pearlyn with our son to slowly warm him up to the environment and they gave us constant updates to assure us.  Rachel and her whole team of teachers are very loving, passionate, dedicated and nurturing. Every single teacher regardless of the level that they were in charged of, were familiar with every child in Kinex from PG to K2. The feeling they gave us was that the entire school was one big happy family. All the teachers there have been teaching there for a considerable number of years. Attrition rate is low and they have a great seamless system and clockwork going on. This has to be attributed to Rachel‚Äôs strong leadership.  No child or parent gets left behind. They were there every step of the way with us right from the start, responding to our many queries, allaying our fears and making sure our child and every child gets to fulfill their best potential in their time. They were there to encourage them when needed, yet being firm with him and rewarding him when he does something positive.  Besides focusing on the curriculum, Rachel and the teachers also made sure the childrens‚Äô social skills and inculcation of values were not missed out on either. Those to us were more important than the curriculum itself.  We did not have to worry one bit putting our son with Mindchamps Kinex whilst working. We know that he was in the best hands.  It was very sad and heartbreaking that we had to leave kinex for another branch because we relocated to the other end of the island. We have Rachel and her stellar team to thank for setting such a good foundation in our child that he transited well in the new school.  I cannot thank especially Rachel, Miss Neesha, Miss Anna, Miss Pearlyn, feng lao shi, Miss Camille enough. Thank you all girls for all the heart work that you do. ‚ù§Ô∏è, Thanks to the amazing team of teachers who put in efforts to create a safe and nurturing environment for the children to grow and develop in. My daughter has enjoyed her lessons and loves her teachers here so far., We signed up with them since PG and have not looked back since. They are dedicated and caring, yet strict in reinforcing rules and correcting proper behaviours. The school is very clean and we have not had any major episodes of viruses (touch wood) so far. My two kids enjoy going to school everyday and we appreciate MindChamps in preparing our kids for their primary school journey., Our little one has been with MindChamps @ OneKm (East Coast) for the past 4.5yrs (PG to K2) and we were glad we made such an excellent choice. We had heard so much about how good the principal and teachers were at Mindchamp (East Coast), now at OneKm even before we sent our kid there and decided to check the school out. Not only did the preschool left a good and deep first impression on my husband and I; the holistic and safe environment backed by the team of dedicated teachers was what we deeply appreciate throughout the years.  Ethan Choo would not have come this far and transit so smoothly into his Primary 1 if it had not been for the love and guidance from his teachers. You have our heartfelt thanks, Mindchamps @ OneKm (East Coast)!, Started with MindChamps East Coast in 2012 for my eldest girl. And now into 3rd year for my younger son. The school is well managed with very low attrition rate. Teachers are experienced and prompt at addressing parents concerns. Students are well nurtured with empowerment and leadership. I‚Äôm glad that i picked MC East Coast. Look no further if you want a school with high quality care served by this dedicated team., My son was enrolled into mindchamp for 4 years. The teachers are very dedicated and provide regular feedback on the child's behaviour, interaction with friends, performance etc. The curriculum includes gourmet, gym, phonics etc. Which makes learning fun and engaging for the kids. Strongly recommended., 5 years ago, I was a 1st time parent looking for a preschool for my 1st child. Had walked into Mindchamps East Coast randomly and was blown away by what I see as compared to other centers I visited. There was no turning back since then. Teachers are sincere and whenever I have issues with my kids ( both academic and behavior) I will not hesitate to discuss it with the teachers. They will give advice and also reiterate the same to the children in school. 2nd child is now in the same school and I know he is in good hands. Thank you MC East Coast!, We visited more than a handful of preschools in 2014 when we were looking for one to send our daughter to. Definitely a no brainer amongst those we visited! 2 years later and it was time for us to send our younger son and again a no brainer! Excellent team of core teachers and principal who gives feedback both for academic and non academic, wanting the best for the Champs both at home and in school! Our daughter is graduating this year and she has already mentioned that we will miss all her friends and teachers!! ‚ô•Ô∏è Thank you teachers for your love!, A caring and dependable team of teachers from Mindchamps Preschool (@Kinex)! The principal is always on the go, responsive to our queries and helpful. I really appreciate the help, support and cooperation by the team all these years, since my boy enrolled for PG in 2017. Will strongly recommend this preschool to my friends & colleagues!, We highly recommend MindChamps @East Coast. Mrs Koh is a very capable principal and with her leadership and a group of dedicated teachers, we feel our daughter is in good hands. We feel the staff are highly organized and understand every aspects of the children in great details. - N2 Jiang Yutong's Dad, My boy is with mindchamp east coast since PG. The school has a team of dedicated teachers with low turnover, led by Mrs Koh, the same principal since enrollment. I feel assured to leave my boy in this child care and knew that he is in good hands and strict discipline. Teachers also provide regular feedback to parents via the App and face to face meetups., I transferred my girl from Mindchamps CBP to Mindchamps East Coast when we moved house 2 years ago. Both Mindchamps are good because of several factors of importance in my consideration: 1. Staffing -  Principal, Teacher with low attrition and change. And Professional in communication and the program plan (English proficiency eg. grammar, Chinese proficiency eg. For engaging children with little interaction with Chinese at home) 2. Safe Environment - how they handle misbehaviour, cleaning and sanitisation, and separate bathroom for boys and girls to protect their modesty from young. 3. Holistic education - Not just academic focused but overall exposure to different learnings at their young age (eg. Gym class, confidence in speaking in front of peers, simple cookery class, artwork, playtime in playground, music etc) 4. No homework for parents except for K2 (spelling only). U can tiger on weekends if that's what you need but not for me. I am particularly happy with Mindchamps East Coast as I can entrust my children with very caring teachers and principal in this branch., Attentive and professional teachers who care for the children. Always prompt to update me on happenings regarding my two year old boy and sharing tips on how to better his development. School even gave me a handwritten note to congratulate us for a newborn baby girl. Very good staff and management (not to mention the comprehensive syllabus), hence highly recommended, I have never regretted leaving my two kids in the good hands of the team of teachers  at Mindchamps at One KM(Kinex mall). They have on many occasions gone out of their way to help my kids adjust to each phase of their development - be it toilet training, overcoming their fear of a dark Theater or even ensuring that my Son does not come into contact with certain foods he is allergic to. Thank you Teachers!, Placing my child at a Mindchamps One KM is the best thing that I ever did . Mrs Koh the principal is very conscientious and she goes all the way out for the children and parents . My respect and kudos to her . Also appreciate all the Teachers for their patience and genuine love for my child. As he is slow, but the Teachers are ever so encouraging and a good impetus to improvements in his life., Teachers are kind and patient with my little one ‚ù§Ô∏è good open lines of communication and we trust them., Would highly recommend Kinex Mindchamps. Mrs Koh & teachers are very dedicated,attentive and good people who can teach,guide and prepare young kids for their next stage. Really thankful for their efforts. And will definitely sign up for my coming newborn as well., Would highly recommend MindChamps PreSchool (East Coast) @Kinex to all parents! Both the principal and teachers there are capable, committed and caring. My husband and I feel assured leaving our kids in their care and had never once regretted our choice!, Good school and environment. Teachers are attentive and caring. Thank you to Ms Christina Ms Camille Zhao Laoshi, Ms Yeo, Mrs Koh and all the lovely teachers, My son joined Mindchamps just last year. In less than one year I find a big positive change in him. He was a very shy kid, now he talks openly even challenges me some times. He had shown a big leap in academics as well. Thanls a lot to the teachers.., Would definitely and highly recommend Mindchamps@1km to all parents out there. Both my kids started with them since PG. The Principal and Teachers are highly reliable, caring and I have absolute trust leaving my children in their care. Thank you all! :), Teachers are very professional and very responsive. My boy couldn't really understand not could he speak any English when we first put him to Mindchamp Onekm. Now after 2 years, he could speak good English and sometimes could even correct us if we said anything wrong. Environment wise I personally like it a lot compared to other pre-schools as it is clean and comfortable. Highly recommended!, My daughter has been in Mindchamps since she is 20 month-old (in 2014) from when they were at East Coast to the new premise at oneKM. They have an awesome team that is dedicated and provide really quality care. As a working mother, it puts me at ease knowing she is in good hands., Am impressed by how much my 2 year old has learnt since starting school 6 months ago. Constant updates from teachers on his progress and behaviour. All the children in the school all seem happy and seem to enjoy school so much. Thank you teachers and staff of MindChamps for the hard work!, Always prompt to update me on happenings regarding my daughter and sharing tips on how to better her development.  A peace of mind when your kids are with MindChamps. Recommended! Two thumbs up!, Excellent core team of Principal and teachers. Both my kids are there from PG. One will be graduating this year, no preschool is perfect but this one ranks as one of the better ones around. Keep up the good work!, My daughter has been with them for over two years. She has enjoyed it a lot. Teachers are very responsible and caring for her. I would recommend this school to anyone that is looking for a good preschool for their kid., A team of experienced and dedicated teachers. I have seen the improvement in my girl since she entered Mindchamps preschool @ onekm. We love the School's curriculum too!, Teachers there take great pride in their work! Have no regrets signing up my kid in this particular school., Good learning environment and teachers.. recommend üëç ‚Ä¶, Centre has relocated to Kinex shopping mall at Paya Lebar MRT, premises is clean,  and curriculum is well paced and structured, A caring and responsible preschool, We came to Singapore from China and have been attending kindergarten in Majors on the East Coast for a year. Compared with the previous school, we can see many differences. The teachers here have a strong sense of responsibility and communicate quickly with parents. Every time the teacher finds something that needs improvement in the child, he will communicate with us in a timely manner and give us good advice. As a parent, I enjoy seeing the changes and growth in my children this year. The most important thing is that the child is happy than anything else!, Thanks to the management team and teachers of MindChamps@east coast. Under your careful care and guidance, Yutong quickly adapted to school life and looks forward to going to school every day. The school's awareness and enforcement of safety and hygiene measures effectively ensure that children can learn and play in a safe environment. In addition, the school teachers‚Äô cultivation and attention to good behavior among children allowed me to hand over my baby to the teacher with great peace of mind. As a mother, I feel confident that my children will be properly cared for at MindChamps@east coast. As a mother of two children, when my second baby grows up, I will still choose MindChamps!  Feng Lin N2 Jiang Yutong‚Äôs mother, The teachers at the school are very serious and responsible. We are from China and our English is not very good. The teachers arrange for the children to have contact with English-speaking children and teach them to have strong self-care skills. The teachers can also communicate in a timely manner about the children's situation at school. In the school The environment is also very good. Overall, I am very satisfied., We are from a Chinese family and we rarely use Chinese at home. However, since Wang Guangxi came to school, he can now speak a lot of English. As long as he can speak, he chooses to speak in English. The teacher will teach him in different ways and is very patient. Thank you."
MindChamps PreSchool @ One Raffles Place,"Both of our kids go to Mindchamps ORP and we could not recommend more. We looked at many other preschools including Mindchamps other branches as we move home but ORP sets the bar so high that we simply cannot find another place that we could feel the same sense of belongings and peach of mind as here. There are teachers coming to school to get their pay check which is totally understandable; but at ORP we see the genuine love for children. The teachers here bond and put their emotions into the students which make huge difference from doing it simply as a job. Chuang Laoshi, Ms Qiwen, Cheng Laoshi, Mo Laoshi, and Ms Kristine, Pan Laoshi..yes we can name many teachers because teachers in this center know the kids across the center. The love does not stop by the walls of classrooms. Comparing to bigger centers, ORP may not have the first class facilities, may not be the most spacious. But what is more important than these are the people! We have full trust in the teachers here. With Love and Light, Feedback from Nathaniel‚Äôs Parents ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è  Thank you Tr Yati and Chen Laoshi for taking care of Nathaniel and as parents we are indeed very satisfied with his 360 degree development during his N2 class.  We have seen tremendous improvements in his social and emotional development.  His vocabularies and overall speech literacy has improved a lot as well.  We have noticed his confidence level that‚Äôs always on a high after joining MindChamps.  Although he is still weak in his numeracy and letters writing or sentence formation, we do believe with consistency in training him and assuring him on his capabilities, we are sure he will catch up on this soon.  We seek your kind support to our child and we as parents are willing to assist at home in any way we can to help Nathaniel to continuously thrive and be happy in school.  Many Thanks üòä, Ever since he joined ORP mindchamps, our son has made remarkable progress in his fine motor and language skills. He never fails to amaze us with the things he learned in school! The teachers‚Äô regular updates on his development also assure us that he will be able to learn and grow on a safe and caring environment. Thank you to all the PG teachers for making Declan‚Äôs journey so enjoyable and delightful!, Teachers were very kind to my daughter but turnover rate was too high. We seemed to have staff leaving and coming every quarter while we were there.  The operations manager was slow to respond to our emails and also wrongly calculated the ECDA due to us.  Principle is very passive and communicate via emails only. During school events, she remains quiet at the side - sorry if this seems offensive but I had thought she was only an admin staff or support teacher.  Again this review doesn't do the teachers like Mo Lao Shi justice but the other aspects of the center was simply a let down., Inspiring and caring teachers. Spontaneous staff. Mindchamps ORP is a happy preschool.  Special thanks to Ëé´ËÄÅÂ∏à for encouaging and cultivating the 'speaking Mandarin' habit in my daughter which she had issues in the beginning. She has also showed great interests in Chinese language now and would sing ÂÑøÊ≠å happily after school.  She has become an independent and self-directed learner.  Thank you Mindchamps ORP!, I am happy that Mindchamps offers Writing Programme suited for our 7 year-old son. Their programme focuses on the understanding and creative aspects of writing which makes it more fun and interesting for him. The activities are designed to complement the MOE Curriculum which make me think that my child is in good hands. Thank you MindChamps for creating useful programmes like this one., Hi,  During this 2020, my daughter has show improvements, especially in the second year.   I can observe tremendous progress in English & Chinese writing & reading.  Greatly appreciate and my heartily thanks to teacher Siti and teacher Song for their extraordinary efforts.  Good work.  Best regards, Richard Fung, My daughter has shown great improvements in her reading and writing. Credit goes to her teachers for their efforts in ensuring the children have had dun learning!"
MindChamps PreSchool @ Sengkang,"My son has been in MindChamps since he was 20 months old but transferred to MindChamps Sengkang in June 2023 when he was in N2 because he didn't seem to enjoy his last centre as much as I had hoped he would. Transferring him here was the best decision I've ever made. The teachers in this school are outstanding in every way - they are a truly passionate, nurturing group of educators who love what they do and the children that they teach. And this love is quite evidently reciprocated by the students, who can't seem to get enough of school! My son longs to return to school even on weekends. Thank you for making school a very happy place to be at, as it should be. :) Shout out to Ms Hepzi, Ji Laoshi, Ms Ross, Mr Jeremy, Ms Anne, Ms Amenda and Ms Sharlene for always being so warm and attentive. If you're looking for a preschool that not only excels in its curriculum but provides a safe, nurturing and genuinely compassionate environment, look no further. The champs in this school are a happy troop who are always so polite, thoughtful and pleasant in their mannerisms - a testament to the quality education they receive here. :), My kid is usually slow to warm up in schools. He appeared very comfortable with the teachers and school in just 3 weeks. The things he learnt is in 6months is way much more than the 7 months he was in the previous school. I believe that school is not just about phonics, language, math and words, but also about knowledge around the world. He often comes back sharing about what he learns and some happenings in school. This is something which was not observed in previous schools.  All these attribute to the committed teachers. They genuinely want to know more about the kid and make the effort to engage the kids. The support and nurturing environment is definitely one of the factors that allow him to open up faster.  They help the kids to excel further in their strengths while encouraging them to work on their weaknesses. The curriculum in the school emphasises all aspects of development. The kids also get some exposure to performances that helps to build up their confidence.  I love the open communication with the teachers. The teachers are very approachable and we do get regular updates about their progress in school.  No regrets in sending my kid to the school. Highly recommended!, Xochitl started the mindchamp‚Äôs in June 2023. Since then, we have noticed positive changes from our daughter. She used to be slightly introverted and have since gained much more confidence in group settings. From being reluctant to turn up for school, she is now excited about learning new things and through positive reinforcement from her Teachers, she gained a newfound interest academically. Xochitl form teacher Ms Lydia is a very helpful and kind teacher‚ù§Ô∏è,Meng Yao Lao Shi also trying her very best to let my daughter interest in her Chinese.  Listening to her sing praises about the Teachers makes us feel at ease, along with how our relatives have seen her notable changes, we would want to thank mind champs from the bottom of our hearts. A huge thank you for seeing our daughter through such a crucial stage of her life, nurturing her in a positive way which lays her foundation for her future development.  Thank you! Sincerely, Wei Nan & MichelleI‚Äôm, We enrolled our boy into Mindchamps Sengkang when he was 18 months old. 2 months had past and he had shown significant improvements in his fine motor skills, ability to listen to instructions and gained more confidence in his speech. The engagement and support from staff and teachers is excellent. Aside from updates through the App, face-to-face conversations are genuine and teachers are extremely approachable. Through our observations and communication with the teachers, we can feel that they genuinely love children and want the best for them.  We love the curriculum as well which is pretty comprehensive even for PG level children, where they get to explore the various themes in music, gym, gourmet lessons. It has been an overall positive experience for our family, where we now see our boy showing much more interest in communicating and responding with people. He eats better than before, always wanting to attempt to feed himself. I can‚Äôt wait to see more of such positive changes. Enrolling our boy into Mindchamps Sengkang is the best decision we had ever made for our boy to date. Highly recommend the preschool to other parents!, My boys have been very happy and enjoys school since we transferred them to Mindchamps  in Jun 2023. The teachers are professional, committed and care for the children. No regrets transferring to Mindchamps!, My experience with this preschool has been nothing short of exceptional, and I am beyond grateful for the positive impact it has had on my sons.  When my older son first started at MindChamps, he never spoke a single word of Mandarin. However, with the incredible guidance of his Chinese teacher, Ji Lao Shi, he has opened up to the language in a way that I couldn't have imagined. It's truly remarkable to see how he has progressed and embraced Mandarin under Ji Lao Shi's care and instruction.  One of the things I really love about this school is the extensive exposure it provides to children. My sons have had the opportunity to explore various interests, including learning musical instruments like the violin at such a tender age. They even had the chance to perform at a public venue, and I could see how much they enjoyed the experience. It's heartwarming to witness their enthusiasm for learning and self-expression.  The teachers at MindChamps, especially Ji Lao Shi, Miss Lydia, Miss Chantille, Miss Joy, Li Lao Shi, and Ling Lao Shi, are exceptional. They played a pivotal role in easing both my sons' transition into the school. It's evident that they genuinely care and love my children, which, as a parent, is what matters most to me. The support and nurturing environment they provide make all the difference.  I must also commend the principal, Miss Amenda, for her attentiveness towards parent feedback. It's truly amazing to have a principal who values and listens to parents' opinions and concerns.  Academically and holistically, my sons have shown significant improvement since joining MindChamps Preschool Sengkang. I wholeheartedly recommend this preschool to other parents seeking a nurturing and enriching environment for their children. It's been an incredible journey, and I am excited to see how my sons continue to thrive at this wonderful institution.  Thank you, MindChamps Preschool, for your dedication and commitment to nurturing young minds. We are grateful to be a part of your school community!, In June, we enrolled our daughter at MindChamps, and the transformation we've witnessed in her has been truly remarkable. She now effortlessly manages her daily routines and eagerly looks forward to attending school each day.  One of the aspects we appreciate the most is the thoughtfully designed curriculum. It caters to the holistic development of our child, addressing her social and emotional skills, which we hold in high regard. MindChamps excels in guiding her social behaviors and provides ample opportunities for her to shine in public settings.  Under the leadership of the dynamic Principal, Ms. Amenda, MindChamps has organised community outreach events for the children to participate in. In a short period, our girl has been involved in events such as the ""Grand mall opening ceremony"" and the ""Mid-Autumn Festival performance.""  The teaching staff at MindChamps is truly exceptional. Their dedication and professionalism shine through in every interaction. We would like to express our heartfelt gratitude to Ms. Lydia and Ji laoshi, our daughter's form teachers, for their unwavering patience and timely feedback, which have played a significant role in her growth. We also want to extend our appreciation to Ms. Chantille, our daughter's English program (MRW) teacher, for her guidance and support, which have enabled our girl to read English books fluently at her level.  When it comes to Music, Mr. Jeremy has been a fantastic mentor, and our daughter now enjoys playing the violin and other instruments. Last but not least, a big thank you to Ms. Hepzi, who consistently adds a fun element to Nuro Move. Your contributions to our daughter's overall development are greatly appreciated.  Every day, our daughter discovers something new at this preschool. It's the perfect environment for her to learn, explore, and flourish.  In conclusion, we wholeheartedly recommend MindChamps @ Sengkang to other parents seeking a nurturing and comprehensive early learning experience for their children. It has been a truly rewarding journey for our family, and we are excited about the bright future it is shaping for our daughter., I enrolled my son to MindChamps @ Sengkang and this preschool has exceeded all our expectations! All the teachers and staff are caring and attentive!, MindChamps PreSchool @ Sengkang is a new centre that was opened in April 2023. We enrolled our second boy, Thomas to this new centre from day-1 and he was the first student in his N2 Passion class. Given the short duration of 1.5 months, we already observed fast growth on Thomas through the centre‚Äôs well-designed curriculum and learning system/ process with highly qualified teachers. Initially, Thomas was a bit reluctant to go to school because this is his first pre-school. Now, he enjoys himself very much to go to school every day. Thank you so much to the school principal, teachers and staffs at MindChamps PreSchool @ Sengkang. Special thanks to N2 Passion form teachers, Ms Hepzibah & Ms Ji Kai Li and support from Ms Zhang Ji Xing. Appreciate all effort from everyone and look forward to an excellent learning journey for Thomas., My girl is happy to go to school every day after we transfer her  to MindChamps in sengkang., Extremely good!, In the blink of an eye, my 5-year-old sister has been attending mindchamps@Seng Kang for more than three months. I have become accustomed to watching her rushing into the school gate every day and listening to her happily sharing all kinds of random thoughts after school: We went to the supermarket to buy some food every day. Fruit, I made yogurt after getting up in the afternoon; when I played in the water today, I shared toys with my friends; today a certain classmate gave me a gem (plastic), üà∂Ô∏èthe colors of the rainbow, etc., etc... And these three In the past few months, with the help of the teacher, my sister's independent reading ability in Chinese and English has also been greatly improved. Occasionally, she would make superfluous remarks in the conversation, play the piano to an ox; or take out a Level 4 Oxford tree and relish it in the corner. When reading, the old mother felt really happy. After all, every parent hopes that their children can develop a good habit of independent learning as they grow up, and have a happy and splendid childhood. I would like to sincerely thank Ms. Lydia and Teacher Ji for their careful teachings, allowing my sister to become a better version of herself; thank you to Principal Amenda and all the teachers for creating a happy and friendly atmosphere for the children's growth. Thank you üåπ"
MindChamps PreSchool @ Mapletree Business City,"MindChamps is truly a remarkable learning environment for children. The dedication of their staff to nurturing young minds is evident in every aspect of the preschool. The engaging and creative curriculum they offer helps children develop not only academically, but also socially and emotionally. It's inspiring to see how they create a safe and supportive space where children can explore, learn, and grow., I sent both my children to this preschool. Very positive experience. Nice and friendly environment More importantly the kids seem to enjoy it., Academic wise very strong. When my son graduated, he brought back so many exercise books that I felt amazed. Learned a lot of diverse content including speech and drama, music, gymnastic, etc. Thoughtful and experienced teachers. Clean environments. Good communication too. Overall good experience., I am so grateful that I have found this preschool for my girl. I can see lots of improvement of her after attending the school for almost a year now. I have enrolled her to mindchamps MBC when she was 2 years old and 8 months.  When she just started that time, she didn't really engage and join the activities with her peers and also quite picky on the food. I need to prepare lunch and snack for her to eat at school. The teachers there are very dedicated , caring and patience with her. They spent lots of effort and encourage her to join the activities with her peers and adapt to the school environment and routine.  Now she can eat all the food provided by school and even at home she also not picky with the food anymore. After playing with her toy or read her book, she will put back the toys and books to the place where she took it. I can see a lot of behaviors changes within this period and she is so looking forward to preschool every morning and always return home with her happy and smiley face.  Thanks mindchamps MBC teachers for all the guidance,  love and caring that you have given to my girl. Much appreciated., Mindchamps @ MBC have been great for our girls. We initially chose the location for its convenience, clean environment and great outdoor space. But what we got out of it was a whole lot more from engaged and effective Teachers to very caring and attentive teaching assistants. Our girls enjoyed their years at the preschool tremendously., I have entrusted all my 3 boys to Mindchamp in mapletree. Teachers here are kind, caring and well trained. They know how to engage and teach the children well. My 2 older boys have no issue coping with the primary school transition. Good and clean environment with individual room for each class so K1 and K2 are not distracted by the younger children., MBC's teachers are well trained and they not only utilises the mindchamp app but also provide face to face updates of my son's educational progress.  Their app includes the latest info and progress reports with photos to allow parents to know everything. The food is catered by reputable caterer vendor and guaranteed the champs' health and well being.  the location is impressive. MBC is a grade A building with natural amenities like park, eco pond and allow the champs to walk to nearby mrt station, shopping mall and even supermarket to learn more things and gain more knowledge.  MBC prestige location has grade A security and even has periodic police task force patrolling to ensure the deveopment's safety. there are banks and government agencies occupying the devlopment spaces and hence, the champs can be guaranteed world class safety.  i love my son when he sings ""preschool so much fun"". i know that he has enjoyed himself not only in school, but in a renowed preschool with a world class programme.  if i ever get another kid, mindchamps @ MBC will definately be my first and only choice for my kid., Dedicated teachers and caretakers. Very clean and conducive class and environment. Our children are always looking forward to Preschool with MindChamps. üëçüèª ‚Ä¶, My kid has attended this school for three years. She enjoyed her school life a lot. Teachers are kind and caring."
MindChamps Performing Arts PreSchool @ Marina Square,"My daughter has been in MindChamps Marina since she was in Playgroup. My daughter is now in Nursery 2. I have seen her progression through her way of interpretation about what happens in school. From yoga poses, to counting 1-10 using manipulatives, to teaching us her dance moves, to singing, to pushing me to get her to cook! She proudly talks about her teachers at home. There is never a day that has gone by without talking about her experience in school. Even if I have any concerns, you will see responses even after school hours. I don't have to go through every nitty detail about a school when my child is able to express it as a story each day with facial expressions. MindChamps Marina has been closest to our hearts from day 1 till now., My daughter adores the teachers here! She had a wonderful and enriching experience at MindChamp Marina Square. It's a nurturing, interactive, engaging, and loving environment! We are impressed with her newfound skills in reading, writing, singing, dancing, storytelling, and even playing songs on the keyboard!  A heartfelt thank you to all the teachers for brightening my daughter's childhood!, We enrolled our son starting from K1 and he really enjoys the school curriculums and very good interactions with the teachers.

My daughter loves it, so do we, her parents! We love the positive and nurturing learning environment, and amazing staff with so much passion and heart. When I pick my daughter up from school, she often says, ""Mummy, I love my school!"" And it does matter a lot that she does. :), I have lots of fun today performing for my friends, my family and my teachers! The energy from the children were high. I love Mindchamps! üíéü§¥üë∏ü¶Ñüíñ ‚Ä¶, Good job to the team of teachers for preparing Champs for their year-end showcase!

We really enjoyed ourselves with our Champ., My daughter looks forward to going to school everyday! Responsible and dedicated teachers, kudos to the team!, Love the showcase today and thanks dor the guidance that all teachers have given to my girl:l, My son has improved his cognitive abilities by leaps and bounds. No regrets with MindChamps MSQ, I was at Marina Square gain city doing my shopping when I heard this lady saying she from Mindchamps wanted to but some speakers for her event. She kept pressing the poor salesperson for discount. Hello , lady people also earn a living ok . Some more dare to said so loud for the whole world to know she is from mindchamps . Shame to the school for having such LOW CLASS executive., Mindchamps has been instrumental in nurturing and instilling valuable knowledge to my kids. I never have to worry when my kids are in school and I cannot thank the teachers enough for taking such good care of them. The fact that my boy who has left Mindchamps, still misses his preschool teachers says so much! Thank you to the awesome teachers!, It‚Äôs was amazing n fantastic shows. Great jobs teachers!, Good performance put up by my daughter. Good visual arts showcase., My son just loves going to Mindchamps everyday! At home, he will start talking about his day in school, about his friends, his teachers, about what he learnt and how he's having fun at school. He's now a very expressive kid and not shy to share his views, engaging in talks with adults. Having joined Mindchamps Marina Square since PG, he knows all the teachers and of cos, we do not see much turnover for teachers. In summary, we are so glad to have our son at Mindchamps Marina Square., Performing Arts school enable the champ trained to be confident from young., Excellent workshop. Thank you very much!, As with the old African proverb, ‚ÄúIt takes a village to raise a child‚Äù, MindChamps has been the ‚Äúvillage‚Äù that shaped  our kids during their formative years. The academic foundation at MindChamps has prepared my son well ‚Äì not just with a smooth transition to primary school, but also in tackling new challenges and learning more complex concepts at school. With my daughter, through the close involvement of the teachers in her learning journey, she has grown to be more independent and picked up skills such as reading and math, as well as developed an appreciation for nature, art, play and mindfulness, all at a tender age. The teachers at MindChamps are attentive and caring, and they nurture a love for learning. With a well-balanced learning environment, my children have gained the skills and confidence to take risks, make mistakes, and learn from them. I am confident my children has a great head start in their education and in life!, Great musical performance! Thanks to all the teachers!, The teachers in Mindchamps are awesome. They cares for the children and my son looks forward going to school everyday. Highly recommend Mindchamps at Marina Square., Great music workshop held by mindchamps to help parents appreciate the school‚Äôs music curriculum. Big shoutout to the teachers for the effort!, My boy is enjoying and very happy teachers in MSQ MindChamps‚ù§Ô∏è, Curriculum The MindChamps curriculum and values are unmatched, from day 1 of enrolment, the Mindchamps team addresses your champ by name, and in time to come, my kid addresses each and every one of his subject teacher by name, mutual respect at a young age!  Location One of the rare locations in the city where you can literally drop off your kid at the driveway and walk 5 metres to the school, no need to rush into carparks and basements, drop off and pick up is a 1 minute affair, not to mention the MindChamps team makes the effort to recognise your vehicle so your kid is ready to go the moment you walk up to the door, never had to wait longer than a couple of minutes.  City Campus The centre lacks an inhouse indoor playground but they do make use of Marina square's public playgrounds for the kids to enjoy themselves, a hidden benefit - my kid seldom goes goo-goo over indoor playgrounds anymore as he does it on school time anyway, and getting him to leave one is easy, the school has conditioned him well.  Talk about raising a city kid!  Staff Hospitality I recall the first time we visited the centre in the morning, most of the kids were running into the school, and it's with no surprise, there's always a very warm welcome at the door greeting every kid good morning as they get ready through the health checks before school, so they get all hyped up about school the moment they step through the doors.  Chinese Education There is a dedicated chinese lessons and teacher for every level, for a family that speaks only English at home, my kid picked up a remarkable amount of Chinese words for his age.  Summary A famous chinese proverb goes ""‰∏âÂ≤ÅÂÆöÂÖ´ÂçÅ"", if you're looking for a place for your kid to develop with the right values, principles and literal/motor competency, I'll bet my last nickel with the folks here at Marina MindChamps.  Update: My sister saw the development in my kid and registered both her elder daughter in the Mindspace program and transfered her younger daughter to a Mindchamps near her place, kudos to the MindChamps team!, The curriculum is very fun and interesting. My girl really enjoy the lessons., Very enjoyable performance put up by my grandchildren!, My son enrolled for 1 year enrichment class. Results does not improved. I asked to cancel and refund my deposit. Only $200, The consultant is delaying my deposit for almost 2 months. I received the email that I will receive within 1 month. Till now Coming 2 months soon but no news. So desperate until cannot refund just $200. I paid $8000 plus one shot for year. Take money so fast. Refund deposit keep quiet. Not recommended to enrol, once you cancel their programme, reluctant to pay you back the deposit. After 28 jan, I haven‚Äôt received my money, i will report Mindchamps to consumer case. Customer service also very rude, when i told her i will consumer case, she quickly hang up the phone by saying thank you for calling. Education enrichment but no EQ from their employees. How to train the kids with their mindset?, I love MindChamps PreSchool as they taught them very well. They are well behaved., Dedicated school staffs and friendly teachers makes the whole school environment feel very positive, my boy looks forward to school everyday üòä ‚Ä¶, My champ has very big progress, Nice school n nice class teacher, Caring teachers, great facilities and amenities, wonderful environment for kids to grow and learn!, Fun at music workshop to understanx what the champs are experiencing., The teacher is nice.My kids like to go to school., Nurturing and learning environment, Nice teachers üëè ‚Ä¶, Wonderful experience, Great school for preschoolers!, Awesome school!, Ms Yumi's violin workshop was very good. The teacher's explanations were easy to understand and interesting. Parents learned to play the song ""Little Star"" within an hour. I am very lucky to have such an excellent music teacher for my son!, The children stood on the stage and performed confidently, which was great! Thanks to the teachers for their careful guidance and cultivation!, Very good school. My children love it and are very happy every day., The kids love their time at school and the teachers here are so lovely!, Thank you to the teachers for their caring and patient teaching., Very good üéâ ‚Ä¶"
MindChamps Chinese PreSchool @ Cecil Street,"Do not recommend . I would say there are better childcare , pre school out there. The building is not the most conducive. And parking is bad. Too tight the lobby, and the entrance into the school is not very welcoming. I recommend going to other childcare centers . At times, I have encountered that the security guards are rude and do not do their job. The traffic is also always congested and the building mgmt does not do anything. Teachers also have changed multiple times, no stability., The best preschool in the CBD area in my opinion; and possible the best Mindchamps chinese prschool branch even! A true gem! it may not be the biggest centre of Mindchamps but they deliver quality care and execution of the mindchamps curriculum. Principle + Teachers are great - very personable, patient and loving. My 3 kids enjoys going to sch everyday (im so thankful), i think that is the true indicator of how good this centre is! lunch is cooked in-house, not the catered stuff. Thank you teachers and staff for running the centre so well, this is the reason i continue to send through throughout covid until today! im just so glad that they are happy to follow me to work , happy to be dropped off and happy to be picked up at end of day. ‚ù§Ô∏è, One of the best decisions we‚Äôve made for our children is sending them to MindChamps at Cecil Street. They are so comfortably bilingual, it‚Äôs really worth all the time and effort to send them there. Special commendations to the teachers and staff who made everything possible, especially ÈÉ≠ËÄÅÂ∏àÔºåÊùéËÄÅÂ∏à (N1G‚Äô23)ÔºåTeacher Ilena and Ê¢ÅËÄÅÂ∏à (K2L‚Äô23)!, Save your money and go to another school ! Building is old , small , no parking , lifts breakdown , smells on level 1 with security guards who think they are meeting and greeting ü§°.  Take you money elsewhere ‚Ä¶, The only chinese preschool that is located in the cbd. Really appreciate mo laoshi and wang laoshi for being so dedicated to teaching the right values to my kid and taking care of him! My kid went in not understanding mandarin and he could understand instructions in chinese in just a week! Kudos to josephine as well for always putting a smile to every kid who checks into the school no matter what., My wife chose MIndChamps because the also offers Chinese Preschool which we think our child will greatly benefit him once he reach primary years. After three months of attending preschool classes at the age of 5, he can recognize Chinese characters which his teacher patiently taught him in a creative manner.  Maths and English were also given equal focus to equip our child in the future. We know that he is in good hands with MindChamps"
MindChamps PreSchool @ Pasir Ris,"My girl joined MindChamps PreSchool PG class when she was 18 months old. I wanted to take a moment to express my deepest gratitude to Mrs Koh and her team on everything that they have done for my girl.

She had also learnt how to manage her emotions well with patient and constant guidance from her amazing teachers and Principal.  We love the school environment and we love the Principal and teachers even more! They are encouraging and know how to guide the preschoolers to take on new skills. The school also has a very comprehensive curriculum which includes culinary, gym and music on top of academic topics. Our girl never fails to share how much she enjoys school, reciting new songs she learnt, bringing back yummy treats she created in school and showing us what new numbers, alphabets and Chinese characters she was taught in class.

It is definitely one of the top preschools that readily prepares students for primary.  In terms of outdoor activities, the school has a huge playground and a shared massive compound for the children to run around. They get to go out daily except on rainy days.  There are also excursions and water play sessions planned by the principal Mrs Koh and her spontaneous team of teachers. They will constantly upload the pictures and  keep parents updated.  In terms of academic, the teachers in-charge of the class will send a weekly update for English and Chinese via the app. Whenever we have something to clarify/inform, the teachers will promptly read the messages on the app during break time. There is always a two-way communication platform between the school and parents. As for school work, we always look forward to seeing their craft/assignments done in class. MC sentosa teachers indeed put in much effort and guidance. Teachers are  well groomed and staff turnover rate is low.

Appreciate the regular photos and school updates via the app/FB which brightens our day and gives us a peace of mind that our children are in good hands and having fun :), Currently the only preschool on Sentosa offering a curriculum based on our local schools calendar. It‚Äôs comparably more academically focused, probably with the intention of having its graduates assimilate into primary school better. Our daughter likes her teachers - says they are ‚Äúfunny‚Äù, which is the highest compliment coming from the 3 year old., Our daughter is almost 3 years old and has been attending for 3 months now. Previously she attended a well regarded day care as well. We are very happy with MindChamps Sentosa. Top reasons: 1. The Teachers are very organised and the curriculum is well structured with Chinese and art. Children thrive on structure. 2. Very large facilities with much options for play, exploring, and physical exercise. Please tire her out! 3. The app and pages give us lots of visibility of what is going on and our child‚Äôs happiness. 4. The mix of children are friendly and active. Always a few challenging ones but overall quite outgoing.  Our daughter is really happy. The prior school was very good and well respected. Our little girl just finds it more enjoyable here., Our child attended Mindchamps Sentosa since PG and we have seen her tremendous growth over the years, turning into an amazing child full of knowledge, confidence and life's zest. A great thumbs up to the amazing school team and a big thank you for their great passion and professionalism., My daughter joined MindChamps Preschool @ Sentosa since N2. Prior to that, she was really shy and refused to speak up. We weren‚Äôt too confident of her developments as well. MindChamps provided a solid platform on both academic and physical fronts. She now interacts and speaks well, and likes going to school to hang out with her classmates., We enrolled our two year-old at MindChamps Sentosa for one month while traveling for work. Mrs. Koh, Mrs. Casey, and all the staff and teachers were wonderful. Working with the admin was fast and efficient and they were always very responsive. Most importantly our son LOVED his experience. He was always excited to go to school and would come home and enthusiastically share things he'd learned or done. He made some real leaps in his verbal/conversational abilities as well. To be honest we weren't sure what to think of the school at first because it's a commercial chain and located in a resort hotel; however, we would definitely enroll our son again if given the chance (for comparison we were also looking at Eton House but they were not very flexible in terms of either enrollment or shorter term instruction, and would have been much more expensive). Overall, the educational and cultural experience was great for our son and he will forever be a MindChamp!, We were very fortunate to find MindChamps at Resorts World Sentosa.  We looked at a number of schools available in the area and are very pleased we elected for our 3 year old daughter to start with MindChamps in June of this year and now also our 18 month old son who started in October.  Mrs Koh is an amazing Principal. From the moment we met her, we have been amazed at the way in which she connects with all of the students, teachers and parents. Very professional, diligent and always approachable.  Each of the students are encouraged to develop independence and responsibility. We have found our 3 year old thrives on the responsibility and it has assisted in her growth. Ms Joyce is our daughter‚Äôs teacher and we are so fortunate to have such a loving and committed teacher. She always seems to make time to communicate end of the day messages and share very specific insights into our daughter‚Äôs day.  We highly recommend any parent looking for an early stage schooling option to meet with Mrs Koh and spend time with her to understand her passion and competence of not only herself but all of her staff and the amazing program that is offered at MindChamps., My kid has been attending for 2 months, and we can see a positive change in him. His temperament has become better. He is also very cheerful, and loves the teachers there. Thanks to Teacher Pearlyn and Mrs Koh who have shared with us about tips on parenting tips at home so we can align and allow our kid to transit faster. They are very observant with our kid too, hence allowing him to learn and play in the best way suitable for him. We also love the welcoming environment to receive the kid everyday at school. Thanks to Teacher J and all the other teachers who played a part too!, My child has been in the school for close to 1.5 years. The teachers are responsible and caring. Updates of the kids progress in school are prompt.  Feedbacks given to the principal Mrs koh are taken seriously. Lots of improvements are being seen in school. The school practice very good hygiene as well.  The fact that my child looks forward going to school daily shows she is very happy settling in the school and enjoy the class activities.  Thankful to Ms Sya, teacher Feng, Ms pearlyn and any other teachers that I have missed out.  Thank you for being so patient and kind to the children., We love the clean classrooms with huge windows that let in plenty of natural light. We are also impressed by the passion and professionalism of the staff - Mrs Koh, the principal, as well as Sun Lao Shi and Ms Casey, our child‚Äôs teachers. Our child enjoys going to school everyday., The teachers are very professional and timely in their communications with parents. I can also sense that they genuinely care for the well being of the children and show a lot of patience and interest in what they do. My daughter has benefited from this environment and I would like to give a big shout out to Mrs Koh and her team for a job well done!, My boy went in last year when he was N1 and he barely spoke a couple of words but through the patience and guidance of the teachers in 2 months he became a very chatty boy whose vocabulary has increased tremendously. My little one always had a seperation anxiety and would cry and cry when he entered school. In his previous school he cried for months before he got used to it. But with the love and assurance of his teachers and principal Mrs Koh, he walked in proudly to school within a couple of months. In addition, when he first entered the school he was not potty trained and not ready for potty training but the teachers were convinced he could get it off and within 3 days he was off the diapers and officially potty trained. He now loves to go to school so much he would go on the weekends if the school was open. Thank u to Mrs Koh and all the Mindchamp teachers!!, I can see the genuine love and care that the principal Mrs Koh and the teachers have for both my girls especially Ms Anna and Ms Sabrina. This gives me a great relief knowing that my girls are in great loving hands. Thanks for their support, my girls can adapt pretty well and they loves going to school.  I'm happy with the constant updates from the teachers and management through various platforms puts my mind at ease when it comes to their learning and development in school. We're very glad that we enrolled the girls in Mindchamps Sentosa! Love the excellent environment!, Mindchamps sentosa is a wonderful school with very dedicated teachers and a brand new facility. There is a great mix of play and interesting ways that the school inculcates knowledge, habits and self-help skills. All the teachers in the school go above and beyond and they are really committed in helping students succeed., We had gone through less ideal experience with previous childcare centre, hence we were stringent about finding the right one for my girl who is currently in K2 to prepare her well for primary school next year. Thankfully, we found MindChamps Sentosa and we are glad to have made this decision.  Thumbs up to all the Mindchamps teachers and principal for the attentiveness they give to my girl. She loves going to school and came back sharing her learning and fun moments she had in school. Love the location with fun environment and also the spacious gym area!, Amazing school, great teachers and support. This is my son's second school, he loves school and talks about his teaching and learning at home which was totally the opposite as his first.  Teacher helps him to settle magically which made me super happy and relieved. Thank you!, MindChamps sentosa is a great place for any child to grow, learn and love! The school teachers and principle are very professional. My experience as a first time parent sending my 18 months toddler to school was made so relaxed because of how wonderful the team is. They took their time to answer the ample questions I have as a first time parent sending my kid to school and I appreciate that a lot. Teachers gave a lot of updates on my child‚Äôs progression. They diligently check back on how she is also doing at home so both parties know that we are on the right track. They not only care about if she is learning, they also care how she is doing it.  I believe the reason why my daughter transited very well in school was because the team made her comfortable, trust was established well, the environment was clean and happy with a awesome colourful gym which she absolutely love.  It‚Äôs been only 8 months now that my child has started school, she has since picked up a lot of good habits, learned a lot while being really happy doing it. She loves going to school everyday.  Excellent communication from the principle Mrs Koh and Ms Pearlyn and the rest of the team!, This is our son‚Äôs second week with MindChamps @ Sentosa and I am proud to say that my husband and I have definitely made a wise decision to enrol our son to this preschool.  It is our honor and utmost pleasure to have a group of very passionate teachers around our son. Every morning during the drop off, Chu ËÄÅÂ∏à and Yuan ËÄÅÂ∏à never fail to greet us with smiles despite being ‚Äúpunched‚Äù and ‚Äúkicked‚Äù by our son (separation anxiety +++).  Ms Pearlyn and Âè∂ËÄÅÂ∏à are our son‚Äôs class teacher. We have to say that the both of them are extremely loving and caring teachers. They have been great in sharing information and providing interim updates on Atlanto‚Äôs progress in school. We cannot be more assured to leave our baby in their hands. Though we haven‚Äôt had much opportunity to interact with our son‚Äôs enrichment teacher - Ms Belle, we have a good sense that she share similar traits as the former two.  We are extremely grateful to the Senior Principal, Mrs Koh, for accepting our son into the school on a short notice. If you are still searching for a preschool, look no further - MindChamps @ Sentosa is no doubt an excellent choice., Love all the teachers and staff here! My son has progressed a whole lot in all aspects in a short time. Should have registered him sooner üòÇ  The teachers always put in extra effort and do all they can for my son to receive the best care and education. Really appreciate it. Thank you!  Will definitely recommend to family and friends who have young kids ‚ò∫Ô∏è, The teachers are superb. They are extremely attentive to the children‚Äôs development. I like that there is a lot science behind MindChamps‚Äô philosophy. I also have a lot of trust that the school will keep my child safe at all times. The only aspect that can me improved further is more frequent with parents on how the kids faired throughout the week. Perhaps a more detailed weekly report / feedback on the app could be a convenient  way of communicating., My daughter attends Mindchamp (Kinex), which is also cared by the same team under Mrs Koh. We love how our daughter enjoys the endless enrichments in school. In her first year preschool, she can name me both teachers and friends, who she loves to play with.  The teachers are very attentive and yet firm. They are up-to-date with what's happening to her and we work both ways towards her needs. A very supportive and welcoming environment and we are glad to have her in this school.  Now that there is a Sentosa branch cared by the same team, I believe that we will get the same vibes as well. Love to arrange a school tour, just in case we are shifting back to that area., Both my children attend Mindchamps and they truly enjoy their time in school with the teachers and friends. Throughout 2020-2021, there were a lot of disruptions to the classes due to the pandemic. However, Mrs Koh and team did their best to engage with the children in every possible way and communication with  parents did not stop. Truly appreciate the tremendous effort by the school to keep the children occupied and safe at the same time. Thank you !, My boy joined Mindchamps since PG and now already in N2. I‚Äôm amazed to see how much he has developed, in terms of language, numeracy, the way he speaks and behaves, really just wowed me away.  Am very happy with the teachers and principal dedicated attention, always updating us through the app or Facebook page with photos and videos, which gives me a sense of knowing what my boi has been doing and learning in sch.  The environment is very unique as it‚Äôs on an island, having the chance to explore nature. Overall very satisfied with his progress. Thank you so much teachers! Keep it up!, Such a happy and wonderful place for the kids to learn and play! Teachers and the Mindchamps team are extremely warm, friendly, patient and nurturing. Thanks to all Sentosa Mindchamps teachers and staff for creating such a conducive and positive learning environment for the kids.

The principal, the teachers, and the school bus team are compassionate, approachable, supportive and professional.  My twin boys are super energetic and always looking for ways to experiment/adventure and we learned that the principal and the teachers working with individual kids at their pace, monitor their needs and view from kids perspective where the kids full potential can be discovered.  We see so many positive changes and most importantly my twin boys are learning in joy at a safe and clean environment.  We are very happy to be part of this school as we are also learning and growing as 3 years old parents.  Special THANK YOU to, Mr. Kamal and Ms. Siti Amra wonderful school journey team! and THANK YOU to, Mrs. Koh, Feng LaoShi, Ms. Pearlyn, Ms. Anna, Chu LaoShi, Mr. Ayden and Aunty Lim, After surveying a few childcare centres, we finally found a place that‚Äôs perfect for my children. Even though we don‚Äôt stay near the school, but it is definitely worth the travel. I enrolled my daughter first and my son followed suit, and he will soon be graduating from K2. It‚Äôs a bittersweet feeling because I think the Teachers in MC are amazing - I know my child is in good hands, the Teachers are caring, loving, nurturing and they are extremely passionate about what they do. They always go above and beyond, putting an extra mile in making sure that no one gets left behind, socially, emotionally and academically. It takes a village to raise a child and I‚Äôm very happy to partner with MC through my child‚Äôs early childhood days. Kudos to the management team and all the teachers in MC.

MindSpace @ Midview City (Bishan) | After School Student Care for P1-P5 | Powered By MindChamps,"Teachers are patient and responsible. They has a great bond with the child and create an engaging learning environment. My child is having a great time in the center. Not to mentioned the great food variety that cater to taste bud of the kid. All in all a great space for the little champs., Mindspace impresses with its nurturing environment and dedicated staff. The facility prioritises safety and engages children with creative activities, fostering both cognitive and emotional development. Parents appreciate the transparent communication and personalised care plans. Mindspace stands out as a trusted choice for families seeking a supportive early childhood experience., The centre is well equipped (eg nicely furnished classroom, indoor playground and water park) coupled with specially designed curriculum and teaching methods, providing the champs with a conducive learning environment. In addition, there is constant engagement from a dedicated team of administrative and teaching staffs on the happenings and update on the champs., My daughter enjoys her time at MindSpace. She learns techniques which aids in her academic. The curriculum is well balanced with relaxing time for the students. Holiday programs are well planned with interesting activities to keep them entertained and interested.  Teachers are responsible and they give feedback whenever necessary.  The environment is conducive and comfy. My daughter likes to gather around the cafe area with her friends during playtime. There are board games where they can play with.

This has been incredibly helpful in freeing up our evenings and weekends to spend more quality time together with my child, without having to worry about homework. There are also books, board games, indoor playground and water play area which adds an extra element of fun!, Mindspace not only teaches academic subjects, but also teaches students the right attitude to learn, keeping trying and never give up. That is an important learning aspect., We were choosing between Mindspace and another after school care centre in the same area when my daughter was about to commence her primary 1 education. After the school tours, we were convinced that Mindspace will be the right place for my daughter.  Firstly, we were impressed with the state of art classrooms, healthy meals from Nature Farm, indoor water playground and indoor playground and garden.  Secondly, Desmond and Marie were very professional and it‚Äôs obvious they take great pride in the branding of Mindspace. Marie also did some tests for my daughter to assess her pre-primary school capabilities.  Thirdly, we like it that Mindspace also provides Chinese enrichment class so we do not need to bring my daughter to an external vendor for Chinese class.  So far, my daughter always sounds very excited when we fetch her from Mindspace about her time in Mindspace and she will share with us things that she learnt, including idioms and books she read in MindSpace Cafe.

MindChamps Reading & Writing Programme @ Westgate,"I am satisfied how MindChamps helps my child develop his writing skills. He started attending sessions at the age of 6. The management introduce to us their curriculum which we are really impressed because it is inclined with MOE English curriculum standards. Their Writing Tool Box is effective because we can see how our son improves his writing composition. His passion in English writing grows fonder with the help of his teachers at MindChamps and I am running out of words to thank them for their effort., Admin staff attitude really really really very very very lousy. As 3 years loyalty customer, I'm really disappointed, especially the Indian staff, really no manner, hand up the phone during my talking time. She always tell lie to me, and even can said ""I never tell lie in my life"". I don't know how this kind of admin handle parents., Never too old to learn. Start young."

MindSpace @ Tai Seng (Grantral Mall) | After School Student Care for P1-P5 | MindChamps Enrichment for P1-P5,"Deciding to send our kid to MindSpace @ Tai Seng, Grantral Mall was a game-changer; we were glad we made that decision.  The dedication and hard work put in by the center managers and trainers is nothing short of remarkable. From coaching the kids to managing the center's operations, planning events, and keeping us informed about our child's progress, they handle it all with such finesse, it's like watching a well-oiled machine in action.  Before MindSpace, our child seemed to exhibit learning challenges and behavioral hurdles: throwing tantrums when asked to do home work, unable to comprehend basic arithmetic, and disliking classes.  We were pleasantly surprised that after going to MindSpace, he is actually looking forward to attend MindSpace. His attitude towards homework has improved, and he is showing significant improvement in behaviour. We were happy when the school teachers told us that they noticed an improvement with our child.  It's got me thinking-if MindSpace can work wonders for our child, maybe they have a secret recipe for adults too. MindSpace, any chance of an adult program? Sign me up; I'm ready to experience that transformation firsthand!, The centre is well organised and teachers are friendly and knowledgeable. My kid is adapting well in the centre and would recommend anyone who is interested in signing up for Mindspace to consider this centre., Sending my niece to Mindspace@Tai Seng is the best education decision I have made!  My niece (a typical heartlander) became more interactive, can articulate and express herself better.  When I run into logistics coordination problems, the business owner, Ching & her team staff helped me with sincere and stress-free assistance with great initiative. It had helped me in dual capacity as in improving both education where I can focus on work concentration.  Their enrichment  are aligned with MOE and to my knowledge the only enrichment programme  currently with PSLE results verified by KPMG in Singapore which is quality controlled.  Many thanks & keep up with the great work :), We had a wonderful experience at Mindspace Tai Seng. The trainers are very dedicated in nurturing our son even though this is a after school care. The school work hand in hand with parents to optimize the on the learning environment for our son. It's sad that we had to leave due to relocation, but we are very much looking forward to put our son back upon return. Thank you all the trainers in MindSpace Tai Seng for providing a conducive environment for our son., My son had some difficulty to new environment and was not adapting well in previous school hence i chance upon and read up on MindSpace and decided to make the change midyear for my son. I was amazed by the professional teachers handling my son on his very 1st day. When i picked up my son he was already looking forward to go back to MindSpace the next day! Thanks to the awesome admin team and teachers for the great service! Highly recommended!!, I am glad that we decided to place our child in this Centre. The teachers are attentive and most importantly, they are trained on proper ways to handle children. I have my peace of mind placing them here. My child‚Äôs grade also show good improvement after joining the center. Thank you and pls keep it up!!, MindSpace (Grantral Mall) provides a very nice and conducive environment for learning. The trainers are also prompt in providing updates on my son's progress.  He is enjoying himself a lot in the centre and is doing well in terms of curriculum and homework. I would highly recommend parents to try out MindSpace!, I would like to express my heartfelt gratitude to Mindspace for their outstanding dedication and commitment to taking care of my 2 children. Their tireless efforts to review homework with my children have reduced the amount of time and effort I need to spend on them after work. The art of learning and champion mindset programme teaches them life skills that they can apply in an evolving environment, beyond formal education years. They have provided a nurturing and safe environment for children to learn, grow and have fun., My daughter used to dislike going to student care. She didn't like the teachers and centre that she used to attend. Until we switch over to mindspace at Grantral Mall (tai seng)  The centre is very clean and organised.  The teachers are friendly . My daughter totally love going to student care now. She will come home to share with me what she do in school. Teachers not only teaches in an interesting and interactive way. My daughter have so much fun . My daughter now become very organised and will love to do her homework . More discipline now too.  Thank you so much to the teachers in mindspace, I chanced upon this after school student care through a leaflet sent in my mailbox. Initially, I did not think very much about it till I met my sister who then just recovered from a nasty episode of COVID. I could see that she was definitely not as fit as before and on top of that, she shared that her grandson is attending several after school enrichment programmes in the week. Being the day carer for this boy, she has to make multiple trips per day.  There I was looking at the leaflet for the second time that week and realised that this could solve some of the issues my sister was facing. I called up the centre and expressed my concern on behalf of my sister and Ms Ching Ching has been very attentive and empathetic of our situation. She assured me that her centre is able to help us overcome the challenges that we are facing.  We attended the open house last December and we liked the place as the setup of the centre is conducive, is bright and the layout is fairly spacious. Everything in there are new as we understand the centre is at its start-up phase and most importantly, it is very convenient for us either by MRT or bus.  Without much hesitation, we signed him up and since then, we have been in touch with the trainers, who are also very responsive with our queries and concerns on the day to day basis. The trainers update us frequently on his learning, behaviour as well as suggestions for areas of improvement which we can work with him at home. Due to the close working relationship between the trainers and us, we do see a significantly improvement in his social skills and his academic achievements. I did notice that he is now willing to work with a more challenging peer in this small group setting which otherwise he would avoid even being near to them in a school setting. This value is definitely very well inculcated and many thanks to the trainers in this centre who constantly remind them about peer inclusion and showing empathy towards others.  Lastly, we really appreciated the variety of the lunch menu and the quality of the food. The picky eater (my grand nephew) is now open to eating out of his comfort zone. This is definitely a bonus for him and us.  To date, we are pleased with his development and we will continue to work with the trainers for the betterment of him., The systematic approach and caring demeanor of teachers provide a sense of reassurance to parents., Went to see the centre and it was so well organised and kept clean and spotless. As I am aware of the values that mindspace represents, I am convinced that this will be the place for my children to be at after school.  Solves my issue of having to make sure that my children are well looked after and that they spend productive time after school., School is nice & clean. My son join about 4 months, can see my son have improving a lot. Recommom schoolüòä‚ò∫Ô∏èü§ù ‚Ä¶, Very clean and spacious environment, teachers are committed and knowledgeable. Super thumbs up!"
