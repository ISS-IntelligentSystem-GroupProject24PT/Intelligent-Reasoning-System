Agape Little Uni. @ Gambas Pte Ltd,"""Dangerous parking of Agape‚Äôs school bus just to pick up their own children and blocking the entrance of Small Wonder while preventing parents of Small Wonder from fetching their children safely. This is a selfish arrangement by Agape. Parents of children from both Agape and Small Wonder, please be mindful for the sake of your children‚Äôs safety."", ""I have never seen such a horrible school before as a parent. Management is extremely sluggish with extremely poor SOPs. I hear from my children that the teachers are constantly talking very loudly and disturbing them during their naptime. Hygiene is very poor with my child falling sick every 2 weeks. I highly recommend placing your child in other schools."", ""My girl been in the school for 2 years. She loves the school and teachers very much. The teachers there are very patient and caring which makes us feel confident that our children in good hands. The school environment also very good where classroom is nicely decorated and children can enjoy running around in the rooftop garden and in-house ball pits."""
Agape Little Uni Thomson Centre,"""My baby girl joined the centre when she was around 1yo, because my Indonesian helper injured her hand and we needed the extra help. I'm really grateful for all the help and love Agape provided for her and the family. They extended their help in applying for additional subsidy due to low income, with frequent updates on the progress and how my child was doing. The infant care was also well structured and my child grew smarter in her time there. I felt really supported in this time of difficulty. Agape was the nearest centre available to join on short notice without a waitlist of 2+ months, probably due to price, but it's really worth it."""

Agape Little Uni @ Cecil Pte Ltd,"""Decided to withdraw my baby after his first day as we decided he was incompatible with the teachers (bad crying even though it was just 2.5hrs in the school) but was still charged the full month amount with no room for negotiations to prorate the amount as I could not give the 14 day notice required in the contract. Just goes to show how much compassion the management actually has. Imagine paying a full month fee for only 2.5hrs of attendance because my baby was incompatible with the care provided by the centre."", ""Terrible attitude. Called to enquire about centre visit, am told that visiting hours are only between 1-2.30pm (kids' nap time). Asked if possible to view other times as classroom interaction and observation of the same would be important considerations for us in assessing a centre's suitability. Front desk person sounded she couldn't be bothered with the enquiry and flatly said they don't allow this (with no further follow up or alternative suggestion on how parents can go about getting more information on classroom dynamics and teacher interaction with students, etc.), said ""bye-bye"" on the phone and hung up promptly. TBH if this is the attitude that parents who are cold calling about the centre get, I can't imagine what the situation would be if there was a genuine issue with the centre with an enrolled child. Just terrible and lacking in compassion all round."", ""Very good and nice"""

Acekidz @ SG Pte Ltd (Yishun),"""Very very poor service from the school. Miscalculated school fees, no daily, weekly & worse of all monthly updates. I didnt even know how my son was doing in school bc admin didn‚Äôt even bother to reply my texts. They will reply or text you when it comes to MONEY & MONEY only. I withdrew my son earlier bc things were getting out of hands. The amount of mosquitoes outside their classes. Horrendous. Based on experience, i do not recommend you to send your kids to this school."", ""Just joined a couple months back but we have encountered tons of problems! There was no update when we were onboard the school, there was no communication and the teacher wasn't aware of my child's first day of school! The registration was wrong too and they calculated the fee wrongly. Worst case is that once we paid the wrong fee which was way more than we should have paid because my child was registered for half day, they REFUSED to return the fee despite the error from their end! There were multiple outbreaks of HFMD and COVID in the span of 2 months when we were there and we ended up not sending our child to school. It seems there was a change in principals and the handover wasn't done smoothly and no communication was given to the parents."", ""trusted the school when Ms Kamie, Teacher Sanjana was around. But after they resigned, i‚Äôve realised the school‚Äôs quality is deteriorating, seem that they have lack of staffing, new principal didn‚Äôt give updates, too many teachers resigning, one teacher had to serve food while multi-tasking to feed the kids. school fees is expensive, they stop using air-con, my son always complaint abt he see bugs in class and the school is always hot."""

We can share with them our concerns about our son and they are very willing to help out. We are truly grateful each day, and we have peace of mind knowing that our son is in good hands."", ""My son is visibly happier in this school. When he accidentally wet himself, teacher Pat chose very kind words to remind him to tell her in future if he needs to pee. In a previous school. The teacher would scold him and pressure us parents to either toilet train him asap or put him back on diapers. The choice of words has a significant impact on a child's mind and confidence. ACE @ Cashew Crescent has done a fantastic job of this and we are grateful. Post 1 year update. I enrolled my daughter in this school as well. I believe her teachers Ms Jing Xiao Qian and Miss Nicia have guided Sophia to being herself and allowing her talents to come alive. Miss Jing and Miss Nicia are truly dedicated to bringing out the best not just in my kids but in the whole class as well. They spent countless hours in making all these beautiful decorations for Sophia's graduation ceremony and making an unforgettable experience for the children and parents. I should state that I write this as a typical young parent with the same stresses as every other young parent and I can tell u that Miss Jing , Miss Nicia , all ACE teachers are very well led by the principal Miss Iris Lee. They focus on building confidence in the kids and guiding them to be themselves. I have first hand experience sending my kids to My First Skool and I boldy state that I regret sending my kids to My First Skool. The teachers I encountered were robotic and dogmatic to the point of criticizing and almost bullying children who lag behind. After sending my kids to ACE @ Cashew. I observed a big difference in my children. They are happier and more willing to be themselves and imagine without boundaries. I believe Ms Iris Lee, Miss Jing and Miss Nicia and all the other ACE teachers have played an instrumental role in allowing this to happen. I am writing this review more to express my gratitude to this wonderful group of teachers and share my experience with other young parents."", ""My daughter has been sent to this preschool in K1.

The wonderful and caring ACE@Work (Cashew Heights) team was there holding our hands through the whole transition. Our now 3 year-old is thriving and has achieved so many of his milestones.

My children have made rapid progress under the teachers' education, and their Chinese and English have improved significantly. They like the teachers and the school very much. My child is about to graduate and I am really reluctant to leave. The school's management is also very flexible and effective, for example, children are allowed to drink milk prepared by themselves. Teachers also use appropriate methods when dealing with children's problems. In the recent graduation performance, the children's performances were very good, and I really felt the dedication of all the teachers, especially Teacher Jing and Miss Nicia. My heartfelt thanks to the principal Miss Iris and every teacher here!"", ""When we first moved to Dairy Farm two years ago, we were looking for a kindergarten for our son. The nearby kindergartens were either full or not satisfactory to me. Later I found this low-key kindergarten (it was in an apartment complex, and there was very little information about this kindergarten on the Internet at the time). My son has been in this kindergarten for two years. Facts have proved that choosing this kindergarten is very wise. The kindergarten is located in an apartment with a beautiful environment, isolated from the noise and pollution of the main highway. There are many windows, which can keep the air flowing well, and parents can also watch the children attending classes and playing outside the window. The teachers are very, very friendly. The children learned a lot in school and learned Chinese very well! Now that my son K2 is about to graduate, I really can‚Äôt bear to leave this kindergarten! So I leave a message here specifically to thank the teachers for their hard work, especially Jing Laoshi who has been teaching my son. I also hope that the school will get better and better. üëç"", ""My son has been sent to this nursery since he was 18 months old. Because my son is quite sensitive, he cries every time he goes to school. The teachers at the school are very patient in comforting my child every day. Children learn a lot of knowledge in school and develop many good habits. He is now almost three years old, and he has been tidying up the toys he has played with at home every day. He said that the school teacher told him to clean up the toys before leaving after playing with them! When you see garbage at home or outside, find a trash can and throw it away. Thank you teacher for your teaching!"""

I appreciate the welcome greetings in the morning from all the teachers no matter which class they were from and I love the warm welcoming energy the school have. I must also compliment the Principal, Ms Chew for putting in the effort together with the school, to come up with lots of activities and celebration for the kids. I really love the recent sports day that was held. Activities involving families is something I cherish. It‚Äôs something I get to do with my kid and the school. The school does not only have kind and loving teachers but their cook and cleaning aunties are also very nice and friendly. My daughter loves talking about Aunty Wong. And whenever we see Aunty Wong before entering school, she‚Äôll make small conversations with my daughter and she‚Äôll get so excited.

Overall a very good experience and highly recommended childcare!"", ""My girl used to be a pickie eater and we were always worried about her weight ‚Äì that has always been the main issue every time we had her doctor‚Äôs appointment. Frequent times our Dr used to say she is on the lighter side for her age and that we needed to get her to eat more. As parents, my husband and I have always tried many different ways to get her to eat more -especially on proteins like chicken, but it has never seemed to work. Surprisingly, after she had started going to school at Ms Chew‚Äôs centre, she started to eat bigger portions and she even started to eat chicken. We have seen a drastic healthy change in her weight and we are really happy with this positive change. It took us months to make her eat more but it only took the centre less than 3 weeks. Most of the time before fetching her from school, we would always peek through her class window at what she was doing and often times we noticed her teachers -Lin Laoshi, Pan Laoshi, Teacher Aishah and another Indian Assistant Teacher playing with her and her classmates. This showed that all the teachers, even the Assistant Teachers are very engaging and they would put their heart and soul to caring and entertaining the children. This of course assured me that I have sent my child to the right childcare centre. I would also like to take this time to share that I‚Äôve really enjoyed the many celebrations that Ms Chew have included throughout the entire year and get the kids (and mummies like me) excited!

Really gratedul for mdm Dina, the principal for letting us have a year of fun with the team. Shout-out to teacher Tia, ÈÄ±ËÄÅÂ∏´, teacher farhana, teacher verda and teacher hana for taking care of my girl from n1 to mid of n2. While we have shifted away from jurong, my girl still misses this place and ask us to visit the teachers whenever possible. This shows how much of an impact the teacher has on the kids. Ace at work is a really well rounded school, from language, to numbers and even national education. I think any kids would love going here. 5 star place!"", ""I would like to thank all the teachers and staffs Ace at Work Jurong East, especially Ms. Dina, Teacher Charmaine, Teacher Donna and Liuna Laoshi, for their guidance and support. My child stayed with them for 4 years and I am very secured on how they took care and taught my child. The environment inside is the cleanest childcare I have ever visited. And the teachers and children in this childcare are very kind. The apps used for communication between families and educators is also very convenient for parents to know their children‚Äôs daily situation at any time. Teachers and the principal will also communicate with each parent in a timely and patient manner. Also, the distribution ratio between children and teachers is appropriate. Almost every child receives timely care and attention. They have lots of activities to enhance the children‚Äôs talents and skills (arts, music, sports, etc). Thank you for the 4 wonderful years at Ace at Work and for being a great support to all the parents. Indeed, highly recommended."", ""My son entered this school only for 1 year but i can see there's a lot of improvements especially in his confidence level to interact with people. All the teachers is skilful & professional in handling young kids who just experience 1st time of schooling environment. Highly recommended to join Ace@Work Childcare!!"", ""My girl has just started her first 2 weeks in this school and our experience has been nothing short of amazing. From the first call with the Principal Mdm Dina till the hug from the Teachers today, I can feel their passion, love and care for the students. My girl just turned 2 not long and is at a stage where she is more aware of the environments and also have a mind of her own. She started off isolating herself, refusing to join in the class activities and just watching from far till now enjoying the companion of the students and teachers! I think most credits go to the teachers for making my girl feel safe, loved and comforted. The Teachers also constantly send us photos of our girl and keep us updated of the progress, and attentive to our needs and questions raised. I hope my girl will love school one day and I believe this day is coming soon üëçüèº Many thanks to the amazing team of teachers and of course Mdm Dina"", ""The school is home for our family. The teachers are super sweet and amazing. You can feel how much they are very passionate in teaching the children! I‚Äôm never worried for my boys while under their care and guidance. Good team of teachers, headed by a very caring and friendly principal! Ace @ work 288b kuddos!"", ""A responsive and reliable centre to send your child to..!

Aaytozee Learning Cove,
Aaytozee @ Hillview,"""Contrary to other opinions, I find this school exceptional. Choosing a preschool for your child is a significant decision for parents, and I'm delighted with my selection. My daughter has grown academically and behaviorally, learning things I couldn't have taught her elsewhere. This is largely due to the excellent teacher-to-student ratio, ensuring she receives ample personal attention. I feel reassured knowing she's in capable hands. It's common for people to share negative experiences more often than positive ones, but in this case, I'm more than pleased to highlight our positive experience."", ""Please RECONSIDER sending your neurodivergent & neurotypical kids in all 7 ZEE group preschool. These are the reasons why; 1. The entire outlook of all the centres looks poorly maintained, the walls are old and mouldy, the toys in the centres are limited, the outdoor playground looks dilapidated. 2. Even though the teacher to student ratio is low.. I was able to noticed that the Teachers struggled to teach the class as there were MORE neurodivergent students compared to neurotypical and it was difficult to manage the class. Avoid at all cost!"", ""After subsidy school fees is still very high. Releasing my daughter to cps who have no authority from anybody. How can anybody trust the teachers with their children who do not follow their school rules and regulations. ""Not to release the children to any other people other than the parents or to whom the parents gave authority to pick up"" so unprofessional of the teachers to just release my daughter like that."", ""School fees deduction was terrible and extremely high . No communication between teachers as well ."""
7oaks Preschool - Pasir Ris St. 11,
7oaks Preschool - Jurong St. 81,
7oaks Preschool - Bukit Batok,"""it is a good school, friendly admin and teachers . What I like most is the canteen ,good enough for the student to get ready to P1 not like others pre - school where they eat,sleep and do activity in one place, I find it very compact. what I dislike about 7oaks pre -school is when heavy down pour there's no shelter from the bus stop to the school gate or from opposite carpark to the school ... it so troublesome Overall it's a good choice to send your kids to 7oaks pre-school."""
