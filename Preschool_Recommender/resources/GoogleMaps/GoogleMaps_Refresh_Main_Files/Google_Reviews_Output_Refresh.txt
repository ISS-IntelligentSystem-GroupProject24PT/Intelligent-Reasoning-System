Agape Little Uni. @ Gambas Pte Ltd,
Agape Little Uni Thomson Centre,"My baby girl joined the centre when she was around 1yo, because my Indonesian helper injured her hand and we needed the extra help. I'm really grateful for all the help and love Agape provided for her and the family. They extended their help in applying for additional subsidy due to low income, with frequent updates on the progress and how my child was doing. The infant care was also well structured and my child grew smarter in her time there. I felt really supported in this time of difficulty. Agape was the nearest centre available to join on short notice without a waitlist of 2+ months, probably due to price, but it's really worth it."

Agape Little Uni @ Cecil Pte Ltd,"Decided to withdraw my baby after his first day as we decided he was incompatible with the teachers (bad crying even though it was just 2.5hrs in the school) but was still charged the full month amount with no room for negotiations to prorate the amount as I could not give the 14 day notice required in the contract. Just goes to show how much compassion the management actually has. Imagine paying a full month fee for only 2.5hrs of attendance because my baby was incompatible with the care provided by the centre., Terrible attitude. Called to enquire about centre visit, am told that visiting hours are only between 1-2.30pm (kids' nap time). Asked if possible to view other times as classroom interaction and observation of the same would be important considerations for us in assessing a centre's suitability. Front desk person sounded she couldn't be bothered with the enquiry and flatly said they don't allow this (with no further follow up or alternative suggestion on how parents can go about getting more information on classroom dynamics and teacher interaction with students, etc.), said ""bye-bye"" on the phone and hung up promptly. TBH if this is the attitude that parents who are cold calling about the centre get, I can't imagine what the situation would be if there was a genuine issue with the centre with an enrolled child. Just terrible and lacking in compassion all round., Very good and nice"
Agape Child Care (CCK) Pte Ltd,"Worst ... principal money face. All the time short of Chinese teachers (no one want to stay long) and cooking auntie , teacher have to be cook and teach at same time, students wash plate themself ...., Last week, I visited the childcare centre and all the kids look happy. The childcare centre is built under a bomb shelter. It feels very safe!"
Adventure Tree Preschool - Holland,"Excellent well run preschool with friendly & experienced teachers. The house is well setup inside for different age groups and with pedal karts outside for outdoor play.  Breakfast, lunch and snacks are covered by a daily menu.  My kids have been happy here since starting. Long opening hours when needed. Happy to recommend!, We love Adventure Tree and the schooling environment it provides for our child. Nurturing, wholesome and friendly. The teachers have our children's best interests at heart and best part our little girl loves going to school every day! We could not have chosen a better school!"
Active Learners Enterprise,
Acekidz @ SG Pte Ltd (Yishun),"Very very poor service from the school. Miscalculated school fees, no daily, weekly & worse of all monthly updates. I didnt even know how my son was doing in school bc admin didn‚Äôt even bother to reply my texts. They will reply or text you when it comes to MONEY & MONEY only. I withdrew my son earlier bc things were getting out of hands. The amount of mosquitoes outside their classes‚Ä¶. Horrendous. Based on experience, i do not recommend you to send your kids to this school., Just joined a couple months back but we have encountered tons of problems!  There was no update when we were onboard the school, there was no communication and the teacher wasn't aware of my child's first day of school! The registration was wrong too and they calculated the fee wrongly. Worst case is that once we paid the wrong fee which was way more than we should have paid because my child was registered for half day, they REFUSED to return the fee despite the error from their end!  There were multiple outbreaks of HFMD and COVID in the span of 2 months when we were there and we ended up not sending our child to school.  It seems there was a change in principals and the handover wasn't done smoothly and no communication was given to the parents., trusted the school when Ms Kamie, Teacher Sanjana was around. But after they resigned, i‚Äôve realised the school‚Äôs quality is deteriorating, seem that they have lack of staffing, new principal didn‚Äôt give updates, too many teachers resigning, one teacher had to serve food while multi-tasking to feed the kids. school fees is expensive, they stop using air-con, my son always complaint abt he see bugs in class and the school is always hot."

At first, I was worried that I would not adapt, but gradually I found that my child is happy to go to school every day. Every teacher is very responsible. Of course, the children have learned a lot and are very confident in speaking and doing. When they get home, they will show their performance lessons to their parents. They also have relatively in-depth learning in Chinese and English. Thank you very much for the teacher's course arrangement and meticulous care., My children learned a lot while in daycare. The teachers are also very responsible and give parents a lot of help. It makes us feel relieved to work outside. Thank you teacher for your hard work and guidance over the past few years.

Ace @ Work Childcare Pte Ltd (Cashew Heights),"The teachers provide a fun and enjoyable learning experience for the kids. Especially Jing Laoshi, Ms Nicia, Han Laoshi and Ms Iris. They are always planning enriching activities for the children. They take great effort in organising events that parents can take part too. Their hard work and heart work can be seen in the K2 graduation concert where they patiently guided the children for months to put up an amazing performance. Thank you teachers and staff at Ace@Work Cashew Heights!, My son has been attending this preschool for 1 year (PG last year and now N1), and we have been so blessed with teachers who genuinely care about the kids. We can share with them our concerns about our son and they are very willing to help out. We are truly grateful each day, and we have peace of mind knowing that our son is in good hands., My son is visibly happier in this school. When he accidentally wet himself, teacher Pat chose very kind words to remind him to tell her in future if he needs to pee. In a previous school. The teacher would scold him and pressure us parents to either toilet train him asap or put him back on diapers. The choice of words has a significant impact on a child's mind and confidence. ACE  @ Cashew Crescent has done a fantastic job of this and we are grateful.  Post 1 year update. I enrolled my daughter in this school as well. I believe her teachers Ms Jing Xiao Qian and Miss Nicia have guided Sophia to being herself and allowing her talents to come alive. Miss Jing and Miss Nicia are truly dedicated to bringing out the best not just in my kids but in the whole class as well. They spent countless hours in making all these beautiful decorations for Sophia's graduation ceremony and making an unforgettable experience for the children and parents.  I should state that I write this as a typical young parent with the same stresses as every other young parent and I can tell u that Miss Jing , Miss Nicia , all ACE teachers are very well led by the principal Miss Iris Lee. They focus on building confidence in the kids and guiding them to be themselves.  I have first hand experience sending my kids to My First Skool and I boldy state that I regret sending my kids to My First Skool. The teachers I encountered were robotic and dogmatic to the point of criticizing and almost bullying children who lag behind. After sending my kids to ACE @ Cashew. I observed a big difference in my children. They are happier and more willing to be themselves and imagine without boundaries. I believe Ms Iris Lee, Miss Jing and Miss Nicia and all the other ACE teachers have played an instrumental role in allowing this to happen.  I am writing this review more to express my gratitude to this wonderful group of teachers and share my experience with other young parents., My daughter has been sent to this preschool in K1. The principal Iris and teacher Jing and teacher Nica are very nice and supportive whenever I has any queries. The Table Tennis teacher Tang is very good at teaching Children to make fun of pingpang, This is amazing class! Super good., Our daughter started in the playgroup when she was 26 months old. The wonderful and caring ACE@Work (Cashew Heights) team was there holding our hands through the whole transition. Our now 3 year-old is thriving and has achieved so many of his milestones. With the assistance of every staff member, we believe that our daughter will continue to develop and enhance her social and emotional wellbeing and physical development. We absolutely adore the educators at ACE@Work (Cashew Heights). So glad to have found ACE@Work (Cashew Heights)!, We made the right decision to move our firstborn over to Ace@Work (cashew heights) from another childcare just before he started N1! The teachers here are encouraging,patient, loving and meticulous! Happy to see my now 5yo enjoying himself in school everyday., First time placing my child at a childcare centre (Cashew Heights) due to work. Was in doubt and scared at first but after few days of sending him as a trial with the help of amazing teachers, he had much fun and looking forward to go to school every morning. Location wise is great as it is located inside a condominium, there are amenities that avail for children to explore. Two thumbs up üëç üëç, It's a nice, cozy, childcare centre residing within the compound of cashew heights. Being inside a condominium, the environment feels safer for young kids with lesser passerby . The teachers are also caring and patient and the ratio between teacher and student is good, Best decision ever to enrol my son here since N2. My kid loves the friendly environment and the interaction with classmates. Teachers are caring and helpful too. Special thanks to Miss Iris, Ms Xu and Ms Sharine !, The teachers take care the kid very nice and patiently play and teach with them. Kids are growing up under lovely environment., School is located within Cashew Height estate which has amber greenery and space for children to explore and interact after school time., No response, My two children are in Ace @ Work Childcare (Cashew Heights). Teacher jing, Miss Nicia, Ms Sherine, xu lao shi, and other teachers are all very friendly and patient. My children have made rapid progress under the teachers' education, and their Chinese and English have improved significantly. They like the teachers and the school very much. My child is about to graduate and I am really reluctant to leave. The school's management is also very flexible and effective, for example, children are allowed to drink milk prepared by themselves. Teachers also use appropriate methods when dealing with children's problems. In the recent graduation performance, the children's performances were very good, and I really felt the dedication of all the teachers, especially Teacher Jing and Miss Nicia. My heartfelt thanks to the principal Miss Iris and every teacher here!, When we first moved to Dairy Farm two years ago, we were looking for a kindergarten for our son. The nearby kindergartens were either full or not satisfactory to me. Later I found this low-key kindergarten (it was in an apartment complex, and there was very little information about this kindergarten on the Internet at the time). My son has been in this kindergarten for two years. Facts have proved that choosing this kindergarten is very wise. The kindergarten is located in an apartment with a beautiful environment, isolated from the noise and pollution of the main highway. There are many windows, which can keep the air flowing well, and parents can also watch the children attending classes and playing outside the window. The teachers are very, very friendly. The children learned a lot in school and learned Chinese very well! Now that my son K2 is about to graduate, I really can‚Äôt bear to leave this kindergarten! So I leave a message here specifically to thank the teachers for their hard work, especially Jing Laoshi who has been teaching my son. I also hope that the school will get better and better. üëç, My son has been sent to this nursery since he was 18 months old. Because my son is quite sensitive, he cries every time he goes to school. The teachers at the school are very patient in comforting my child every day. Children learn a lot of knowledge in school and develop many good habits. He is now almost three years old, and he has been tidying up the toys he has played with at home every day. He said that the school teacher told him to clean up the toys before leaving after playing with them! When you see garbage at home or outside, find a trash can and throw it away. Thank you teacher for your teaching!"
Ace @ Work Childcare Pte Ltd (703 Choa Chu Kang St 53),"I transfered my child to another school due to personal reasons. Despite requesting a transfer certificate, it hasn't been provided. I'm struggling to understand why a transfer certificate cannot be issued when all dues are fully paid. I found, the new principal to be a bit less cooperative. Experienced the same in many other instances (Reason for low rating)  Nonetheless, I want to acknowledge the positive experience with teachers April and Zhu Laoshi, as well as the former principal, Ms. Chew, who recently left the school. These teachers and the former principal consistently showed exceptional support and care, We so happy with your service. All I can say is thank you.  You and your team have fostered a sense of belonging and community for my little ones. They  always look forward to going to schoolüå∏üå∏üå∏so grateful to have found a school like yours. ‚Ä¶, My son just joined this school on the 2nd week of Jul 2022 but amazingly his progressive improvement is out of our expectations.  As I know schools have a lot of different types of Lego even our house also has a lot but never seen him could do it alone. Thanks to Teacher's guidance and take care. Also, Thanks to Teacher Chew quick response and update on parents' news or school activities, My daughter have been with the school for almost a year now and she‚Äôs been loving school. Her teachers, Yu Loashi and Teacher Diya are one of the many reasons she love going to school. Other than being gentle and soft spoken to the kids, they‚Äôre also seen always so loving and caring. Yu Laoshi is always so bubbly and cheerful and Teacher Diya is so motherly. I appreciate the welcome greetings in the morning from all the teachers no matter which class they were from and I love the warm welcoming energy the school have. I must also compliment the Principal, Ms Chew for putting in the effort together with the school, to come up with lots of activities and celebration for the kids. I really love the recent sports day that was held. Activities involving families is something I cherish. It‚Äôs something I get to do with my kid and the school. The school does not only have kind and loving teachers but their cook and cleaning aunties are also very nice and friendly. My daughter loves talking about Aunty Wong. And whenever we see Aunty Wong before entering school, she‚Äôll make small conversations with my daughter and she‚Äôll get so excited. That‚Äôs something I appreciate as it builds up my daughter‚Äôs energy making her excited for school. I‚Äôve seen Aunty Wong playing with my daughter and other kids a lot of times too and that is really nice, knowing that the kids are always entertaining and well taken care of ‚ô•Ô∏è, One of rare school who accepts kids with learning issues and yet included them with other kids in their activities. Regularly receives report on my son.  Teachers are great. Very dedicated and patience. The best among all the childcare my son had attended. My wish is the Chinese teachers command of English language improved.  Facilities and environment, I can't complaint. Ace@works is a place where parents could have peace of mind knowing their kids are safe even if their kids plays outdoor. Great location and multiple class rooms., We are really glad that we have chosen the right school. So grateful to all the teachers here who were so patience, full of love and care towards our kids. Specially thanks to Zhu Lao Shi, Teacher April, Teacher Ilah and Pan Lao Shi for their effort in teaching my girl . She really improve alot especially her English and her Chinese . We were sometimes shock with the words she used as it was beyond our thoughts that she can already use and recognized many words . She really enjoy all the actitives in the school especially the outdoors activities and arts and crafts. This school is really creative for always creating  many types of fun things for them to do . Also specially thanks to Teacher Christine for her speech and Drama class , my girl really enjoy Teacher Christine's class. My girl is now more confident to speak. Teacher Christine was full enthusiasm when teaching them so the kids really enjoys  . My girl also loves and enjoys Coach Tang Table Tennis class . She always look forward to Friday for his class . Coach Tang were so professional and always creating exciting games for them to play after the training. I highly recommend this class because it not just for fun but and learning how to play table tennis , but practice their hand,eye, brain and leg coordination and it's also a good physical class as they are able to move lot when they are playing games at the end of the class. Coach Tang makes the class so interesting . Also really glad to have met principal Ms Chew for her always speedy response to our queries and for her effort in making the school so interesting and keeping up the school so well ., The teachers and staffs are friendly. We like and appreciate it when the teachers and Ms Chew sent us pictures of our little one at school. With this great effort, we feel more included with his progress and activities at school. Keep ip the good work Ace@703., My son entered sch in december 2022. So far i can see lots of improvements in terms of the way he communicates with us, he also share with us daily on what happened or what he did in school.  Altho he still cries during drop offs, i believe he really enjoys going to school cos the teachers mentioned that he didnt cry at all in class.  Shoutout to Pan Laoshi, Teacher Fenny,  Teacher Aisyah and Aunty Wo (dont know if i spell correctly), my son now looks forward for school everyday, even on weekends! üòÖüòÇ, This center is doing a great job in developing the future of these kids. In just 4 months of attending this center my son has already learned a lot because everytime I would ask him about school he has so many stories to tell. I can see that he already love going to school. The staff are also friendly and accommodating.  They would gladly answer or provide information whenever I have questions or inquiries. One thing I could suggest though is maybe you can update us once in a while about the progress of our son. We sure would love to hear how he is doing in school. Other than that keep up the good work. Thank you., Both of my boys have been with ace@work703 from the start of their preschool times. They have both thoroughly enjoyed their learning and fun journey there, especially with amazing teachers like Zhu Laoshi who has taught both of them! Thankful for a great learning environment esp through tough times like covid - the school principal and teachers really put their heart and soul into ensuring the kids are well taken care of day to day!, Already 7 months in N1, I see my daughter is having fun and always looking forward to going. She often talks about her Teachers - Teacher Fenny and Teacher Pan - with a smile! I noticed she is able to express herself much better after joining.  Thank you to all the staff in Ace@Work703!, Ms Chew is a very dedicated partner who is always willing to listen to parents' opinions to improve. I am very thankful for her and her team who have been taking care of my son for the past 6 months. My son has improved tremendously, he likes to go to school and makes good friends there. Overall a very good experience and highly recommended childcare!, My girl used to be a pickie eater and we were always worried about her weight ‚Äì that has always been the main issue every time we had her doctor‚Äôs appointment. Frequent times our Dr used to say she is on the lighter side for her age and that we needed to get her to eat more. As parents, my husband and I have always tried many different ways to get her to eat more -especially on proteins like chicken, but it has never seemed to work.  Surprisingly, after she had started going to school at Ms Chew‚Äôs centre, she started to eat bigger portions and she even started to eat chicken. We have seen a drastic healthy change in her weight and we are really happy with this positive change. It took us months to make her eat more but it only took the centre less than 3 weeks.  Most of the time before fetching her from school, we would always peek through her class window at what she was doing and often times we noticed her teachers -Lin Laoshi, Pan Laoshi, Teacher Aishah and another Indian Assistant Teacher playing with her and her classmates. This showed that all the teachers, even the Assistant Teachers are very engaging and they would put their heart and soul to caring and entertaining the children. This of course assured me that I have sent my child to the right childcare centre.  I would also like to take this time to share that I‚Äôve really enjoyed the many celebrations that Ms Chew have included throughout the entire year and get the kids (and mummies like me) excited! I love that the centre is engaging the kids in many celebrations and activities to make their school day exceptionally fun!, The principal, Ms Chew, and teachers at Ace @ Work CCK 703 are really committed towards caring for and educating their students.  I have seen my daughter thrive and improve leaps and bounds since joining the school. Her speech and vocabulary has improved tremendously. She is more sociable now and do not shy away from making new friends.  I also appreciate the teachers' constant updates about the activities conducted in class and for sharing the pictures with us parents. Its really important for us to know that our children are in good hands while we are out working and Ace @ Work CCK 703 is one such place!!, My son has improved a lot after sending him to 703 Ace@work! He can speak well, he can recognise animals , shapes, colours. Ace@work has been doing a great job!  Chew has been a great partner, always there for our queries. She also always reminds us of any events or reminders that us as parents might have missed out. Me and my wife are planning to send our 2nd child there too., My toddler enjoys her days at school. I love seeing pictures of her doing activities  sent by her teachers, it makes me feel happy to see her happy there.  Her teachers are very kind too. They would answer all my questions and update me her after school., we are happy that our daughter enrolled Ace @ Work Block 703 CCK.  We can see she got improvement on speaking, learning and know how to interact with other.  She is having fun and learning new things at center. School stuff and principal are nice and keep us update all the time via Diibaer App., I've been sending my son to Ace @ Work since he was 2 and he is now 5. He has since picked up reading and doing simple addition/subtraction very confidently.  While I'd greatly prefer more HBL support, I am happy with his teachers who has been supportive and encouraging. Their frequent updates via the app on my son's learning and class engagements is a good plus point., My daughter loves the school and caring teachers. The principal is very kind too. She looks forward to school all the time. The teachers take very well care of them and the preschool offers very engaging learning activities very good for the kids., My grandson is with this care center, the teachers and staff are very professional. I like that its huge rooms, natural ventilation. Great management by manager. üëç ‚Ä¶, This child care centre has a dedicated team who takes good care of the little ones.  I am very thankful to the Teachers here. Very caring and you can see that the staff really adore the kids and they are very patient with them. This is an important indicator to me as syllabus and content taught to children in various preschools may be the same but you can‚Äôt replicate sincerity and thoughtfulness of the staff and the staff here sufficiently demonstrate them.  My child had trouble adjusting to school and the school food and they were very accommodating to my requests.  auntie made some changes while waiting for her to adjust to the change in menu at times . props to Teacher Fenny, Teacher April and Ms Chew..  Perhaps one thing they can improve on is the ventilation in the centre. As air con is no longer used in the school due to covid, windows are sometimes not sufficiently opened. Small matter really because they are open to feedback and work quickly to rectify issues.  Thank you Ace @ Work!, A very pleasant childcare with nice staffs.The principal, Ms chew is very vigilant and helpful .The teachers are patient,friendly and interactive. My daughter was reluctant to go in the beginning .However the staffs were very good in making the kids feel like home.All teachers are very kind and good at looking after the kids., My son is in playgrp since June'22.

Tr Fenny, Tr Pan, Tr Teryn, Tr April, Principal Ms. Chew and aunties, they are all very responsible and keen on children.

My daughter enjoys it & always looking forward to go to school!

The 2-year-old baby could start from scratch. Will sing 10+ songs by the end. He is also very self-disciplined in his living habits. He does his own things and is often willing to help his family and maids with housework. I am grateful for the company of Principal Zhou and teachers who are passionate about education. I hope my baby can always learn and grow at Ace!, My son didn't like going to school at first, but he has been in school for almost a year now and is very adaptable. He often speaks some Chinese that we have never taught at home, and sings Twinkle Twinkle Twinkle Twinkle and Pulling Carrots by himself, which surprises me. I asked him if he liked teachers, and he told me that he did. He said his favorite was teacher AprilüòÅ, My kids come here not knowing any English I've made a lot of progress since I came here.

There are also teachers who often take photos of children studying in school and give them to parents.

Ace @ Work Childcare (M1 @ IBP),
Ace @ Work Childcare (JE288B),"My girl has been there since 2.5 years. Really appreciate the teachers effort in making it a fun and enjoyable place for both the kids and parents. The teachers organize events to involve parents too such as mother's day lunch and father's day Spartan race. My girl really love the school.  Really gratedul for mdm Dina, the principal for letting us have a year of fun with the team. Shout-out to teacher Tia, ÈÄ±ËÄÅÂ∏´, teacher farhana, teacher verda and teacher hana for taking care of my girl from n1 to mid of n2. While we have shifted away from jurong, my girl still misses this place and ask us to visit the teachers whenever possible.  This shows how much of an impact the teacher has on the kids.  Ace at work is a really well rounded school, from language, to numbers and even national education. I think any kids would love going here. 5 star place!, I would like to thank all the teachers and staffs Ace at Work Jurong East, especially Ms. Dina, Teacher Charmaine, Teacher Donna and Liuna Laoshi, for their guidance and support. My child stayed with them for 4 years and I am very secured on how they took care and taught my child. The environment inside is the cleanest childcare I have ever visited. And the teachers and children in this childcare are very kind. The apps used for communication between families and educators is also very convenient for parents to know their children‚Äôs daily situation at any time. Teachers and the principal will also communicate with each parent in a timely and patient manner. Also, the distribution ratio between children and teachers is appropriate. Almost every child receives timely care and attention. They have lots of activities to enhance the children‚Äôs talents and skills (arts, music, sports, etc). Thank you for the 4 wonderful years at Ace at Work and for being a great support to all the parents. Indeed, highly recommended., My son entered this school only for 1 year but i can see there's a lot of improvements especially in his confidence level to interact with people. All the teachers is skilful & professional in handling young kids who just experience 1st time of schooling environment. Highly recommended to join Ace@Work Childcare!!, My girl has just started her first 2 weeks in this school and our experience has been nothing short of amazing. From the first call with the Principal Mdm Dina till the hug from the Teachers today, I can feel their passion, love and care for the students. My girl just turned 2 not long and is at a stage where she is more aware of the environments and also have a mind of her own. She started off isolating herself, refusing to join in the class activities and just watching from far till now enjoying the companion of the students and teachers! I think most credits go to the teachers for making my girl feel safe, loved and comforted. The Teachers also constantly send us photos of our girl and keep us updated of the progress, and attentive to our needs and questions raised.  I hope my girl will love school one day and I believe this day is coming soon üëçüèº Many thanks to the amazing team of teachers and of course Mdm Dina, The school is home for our family. The teachers are super sweet and amazing. You can feel how much they are very passionate in teaching the children! I‚Äôm never worried for my boys while under their care and guidance.

Aaytozee Learning Cove,
Aaytozee @ Hillview,"Contrary to other opinions, I find this school exceptional. Choosing a preschool for your child is a significant decision for parents, and I'm delighted with my selection. My daughter has grown academically and behaviorally, learning things I couldn't have taught her elsewhere. This is largely due to the excellent teacher-to-student ratio, ensuring she receives ample personal attention. I feel reassured knowing she's in capable hands. It's common for people to share negative experiences more often than positive ones, but in this case, I'm more than pleased to highlight our positive experience., Please RECONSIDER sending your neurodivergent & neurotypical kids in all 7 ZEE group preschool. These are the reasons why;  1. The entire outlook of all the centres looks poorly maintained, the walls are old and mouldy, the toys in the centres are limited, the outdoor playground looks dilapidated.  2. Even though the teacher to student ratio is low.. I was able to noticed that the Teachers struggled to teach the class as there were MORE neurodivergent students compared to neurotypical and it was difficult to manage the class.  Avoid at all cost!, After subsidy school fees is still very high. Releasing my daughter to cps who have no authority from anybody. How can anybody trust the teachers with their children who do not follow their school rules and regulations. ""Not to release the children to any other people other than the parents or to whom the parents gave authority to pick up"" so unprofessional of the teachers to just release my daughter like that., School fees deduction was terrible  and extremely high . No communication between teachers as well ."

What I like most is the canteen ,good enough for the student to get ready to P1 not like others pre - school where they eat,sleep and do activity in one place, I find it very compact.  what I dislike about 7oaks pre -school is when heavy down pour there's no shelter from the bus stop to the school gate or from opposite carpark to the school ... it so troublesome  Overall it's a good choice to send your kids to 7oaks pre-school."

You and your team have fostered a sense of belonging and community for my little ones. They  always look forward to going to schoolüå∏üå∏üå∏so grateful to have found a school like yours. ‚Ä¶, My son just joined this school on the 2nd week of Jul 2022 but amazingly his progressive improvement is out of our expectations.  As I know schools have a lot of different types of Lego even our house also has a lot but never seen him could do it alone. Thanks to Teacher's guidance and take care. Also, Thanks to Teacher Chew quick response and update on parents' news or school activities, My daughter have been with the school for almost a year now and she‚Äôs been loving school. Her teachers, Yu Loashi and Teacher Diya are one of the many reasons she love going to school. Other than being gentle and soft spoken to the kids, they‚Äôre also seen always so loving and caring. Yu Laoshi is always so bubbly and cheerful and Teacher Diya is so motherly. I appreciate the welcome greetings in the morning from all the teachers no matter which class they were from and I love the warm welcoming energy the school have. I must also compliment the Principal, Ms Chew for putting in the effort together with the school, to come up with lots of activities and celebration for the kids. I really love the recent sports day that was held. Activities involving families is something I cherish. It‚Äôs something I get to do with my kid and the school. The school does not only have kind and loving teachers but their cook and cleaning aunties are also very nice and friendly. My daughter loves talking about Aunty Wong. And whenever we see Aunty Wong before entering school, she‚Äôll make small conversations with my daughter and she‚Äôll get so excited. That‚Äôs something I appreciate as it builds up my daughter‚Äôs energy making her excited for school. I‚Äôve seen Aunty Wong playing with my daughter and other kids a lot of times too and that is really nice, knowing that the kids are always entertaining and well taken care of ‚ô•Ô∏è, One of rare school who accepts kids with learning issues and yet included them with other kids in their activities. Regularly receives report on my son.  Teachers are great. Very dedicated and patience. The best among all the childcare my son had attended. My wish is the Chinese teachers command of English language improved.  Facilities and environment, I can't complaint. Ace@works is a place where parents could have peace of mind knowing their kids are safe even if their kids plays outdoor. Great location and multiple class rooms., We are really glad that we have chosen the right school. So grateful to all the teachers here who were so patience, full of love and care towards our kids. Specially thanks to Zhu Lao Shi, Teacher April, Teacher Ilah and Pan Lao Shi for their effort in teaching my girl . She really improve alot especially her English and her Chinese . We were sometimes shock with the words she used as it was beyond our thoughts that she can already use and recognized many words . She really enjoy all the actitives in the school especially the outdoors activities and arts and crafts. This school is really creative for always creating  many types of fun things for them to do . Also specially thanks to Teacher Christine for her speech and Drama class , my girl really enjoy Teacher Christine's class. My girl is now more confident to speak. Teacher Christine was full enthusiasm when teaching them so the kids really enjoys  . My girl also loves and enjoys Coach Tang Table Tennis class . She always look forward to Friday for his class . Coach Tang were so professional and always creating exciting games for them to play after the training. I highly recommend this class because it not just for fun but and learning how to play table tennis , but practice their hand,eye, brain and leg coordination and it's also a good physical class as they are able to move lot when they are playing games at the end of the class. Coach Tang makes the class so interesting . Also really glad to have met principal Ms Chew for her always speedy response to our queries and for her effort in making the school so interesting and keeping up the school so well ., The teachers and staffs are friendly. We like and appreciate it when the teachers and Ms Chew sent us pictures of our little one at school. With this great effort, we feel more included with his progress and activities at school. Keep ip the good work Ace@703., My son entered sch in december 2022. So far i can see lots of improvements in terms of the way he communicates with us, he also share with us daily on what happened or what he did in school.  Altho he still cries during drop offs, i believe he really enjoys going to school cos the teachers mentioned that he didnt cry at all in class.  Shoutout to Pan Laoshi, Teacher Fenny,  Teacher Aisyah and Aunty Wo (dont know if i spell correctly), my son now looks forward for school everyday, even on weekends! üòÖüòÇ, This center is doing a great job in developing the future of these kids. In just 4 months of attending this center my son has already learned a lot because everytime I would ask him about school he has so many stories to tell. I can see that he already love going to school. The staff are also friendly and accommodating.  They would gladly answer or provide information whenever I have questions or inquiries. One thing I could suggest though is maybe you can update us once in a while about the progress of our son. We sure would love to hear how he is doing in school. Other than that keep up the good work. Thank you., Both of my boys have been with ace@work703 from the start of their preschool times. They have both thoroughly enjoyed their learning and fun journey there, especially with amazing teachers like Zhu Laoshi who has taught both of them! Thankful for a great learning environment esp through tough times like covid - the school principal and teachers really put their heart and soul into ensuring the kids are well taken care of day to day!, Already 7 months in N1, I see my daughter is having fun and always looking forward to going. She often talks about her Teachers - Teacher Fenny and Teacher Pan - with a smile! I noticed she is able to express herself much better after joining.  Thank you to all the staff in Ace@Work703!, Ms Chew is a very dedicated partner who is always willing to listen to parents' opinions to improve. I am very thankful for her and her team who have been taking care of my son for the past 6 months. My son has improved tremendously, he likes to go to school and makes good friends there. Overall a very good experience and highly recommended childcare!, My girl used to be a pickie eater and we were always worried about her weight ‚Äì that has always been the main issue every time we had her doctor‚Äôs appointment. Frequent times our Dr used to say she is on the lighter side for her age and that we needed to get her to eat more. As parents, my husband and I have always tried many different ways to get her to eat more -especially on proteins like chicken, but it has never seemed to work.  Surprisingly, after she had started going to school at Ms Chew‚Äôs centre, she started to eat bigger portions and she even started to eat chicken. We have seen a drastic healthy change in her weight and we are really happy with this positive change. It took us months to make her eat more but it only took the centre less than 3 weeks.  Most of the time before fetching her from school, we would always peek through her class window at what she was doing and often times we noticed her teachers -Lin Laoshi, Pan Laoshi, Teacher Aishah and another Indian Assistant Teacher playing with her and her classmates. This showed that all the teachers, even the Assistant Teachers are very engaging and they would put their heart and soul to caring and entertaining the children. This of course assured me that I have sent my child to the right childcare centre.  I would also like to take this time to share that I‚Äôve really enjoyed the many celebrations that Ms Chew have included throughout the entire year and get the kids (and mummies like me) excited! I love that the centre is engaging the kids in many celebrations and activities to make their school day exceptionally fun!, The principal, Ms Chew, and teachers at Ace @ Work CCK 703 are really committed towards caring for and educating their students.  I have seen my daughter thrive and improve leaps and bounds since joining the school. Her speech and vocabulary has improved tremendously. She is more sociable now and do not shy away from making new friends.  I also appreciate the teachers' constant updates about the activities conducted in class and for sharing the pictures with us parents. Its really important for us to know that our children are in good hands while we are out working and Ace @ Work CCK 703 is one such place!!, My son has improved a lot after sending him to 703 Ace@work! He can speak well, he can recognise animals , shapes, colours. Ace@work has been doing a great job!  Chew has been a great partner, always there for our queries. She also always reminds us of any events or reminders that us as parents might have missed out. Me and my wife are planning to send our 2nd child there too., My grandson is with this care center, the teachers and staff are very professional. I like that its huge rooms, natural ventilation. Great management by manager. üëç ‚Ä¶, My toddler enjoys her days at school. I love seeing pictures of her doing activities  sent by her teachers, it makes me feel happy to see her happy there.  Her teachers are very kind too. They would answer all my questions and update me her after school., we are happy that our daughter enrolled Ace @ Work Block 703 CCK.  We can see she got improvement on speaking, learning and know how to interact with other.  She is having fun and learning new things at center. School stuff and principal are nice and keep us update all the time via Diibaer App., I've been sending my son to Ace @ Work since he was 2 and he is now 5. He has since picked up reading and doing simple addition/subtraction very confidently.  While I'd greatly prefer more HBL support, I am happy with his teachers who has been supportive and encouraging. Their frequent updates via the app on my son's learning and class engagements is a good plus point., My daughter loves the school and caring teachers. The principal is very kind too. She looks forward to school all the time. The teachers take very well care of them and the preschool offers very engaging learning activities very good for the kids., This child care centre has a dedicated team who takes good care of the little ones.  I am very thankful to the Teachers here. Very caring and you can see that the staff really adore the kids and they are very patient with them. This is an important indicator to me as syllabus and content taught to children in various preschools may be the same but you can‚Äôt replicate sincerity and thoughtfulness of the staff and the staff here sufficiently demonstrate them.  My child had trouble adjusting to school and the school food and they were very accommodating to my requests.  auntie made some changes while waiting for her to adjust to the change in menu at times . props to Teacher Fenny, Teacher April and Ms Chew..  Perhaps one thing they can improve on is the ventilation in the centre. As air con is no longer used in the school due to covid, windows are sometimes not sufficiently opened. Small matter really because they are open to feedback and work quickly to rectify issues.  Thank you Ace @ Work!, A very pleasant childcare with nice staffs.The principal, Ms chew is very vigilant and helpful .The teachers are patient,friendly and interactive. My daughter was reluctant to go in the beginning .However the staffs were very good in making the kids feel like home.All teachers are very kind and good at looking after the kids., My son is in playgrp since June'22.

Tr Fenny, Tr Pan, Tr Teryn, Tr April, Principal Ms. Chew and aunties, they are all very responsible and keen on children.

My daughter enjoys it & always looking forward to go to school!

The 2-year-old baby could start from scratch. Will sing 10+ songs by the end. He is also very self-disciplined in his living habits.

I hope my baby can always learn and grow at Ace!, My son didn't like going to school at first, but he has been in school for almost a year now and is very adaptable.

Agape Little Uni. @ Gambas Pte Ltd,"Dangerous parking of Agape‚Äôs school bus just to pick up their own children and blocking the entrance of Small Wonder while preventing parents of Small Wonder from fetching their children safely. This is a selfish arrangement by Agape.  Parents of children from both Agape and Small Wonder, please be mindful for the sake of your children‚Äôs safety., I have never seen such a horrible school before as a parent. Management is extremely sluggish with extremely poor SOPs. I hear from my children that the teachers are constantly talking very loudly and disturbing them during their naptime.

She loves the school and teachers very much. The teachers there are very patient and caring which makes us feel confident that our children in good hands.

Al-Amin Education Pte Ltd,"I hate to give one star reviews but the Principal and teachers last year were simply not good enough. My son couldn't even read effectively in his one year there. He missed a performance and the teacher didn't even call us to ask where he is. My wife pulled him out of the class and we did homeschooling and Alhamdulillah he can start to read now. A wasted year., Sent our kids in this school. Came back with dried up poop in their pants. Told the teacher about it, their remark was they dont give them lunch at school! Subhana Allah, not only were they lazy to change their diapers they dont even bothered to give them a proper meal.  Send them at tour own risk. Both principal and teachers are those cant be bothered ., Dear Admin Please Follow Up!  This Yr 2024 Unexpected NO TRANSPORT SERVICE FOR PICK UP OUR KIDS & Then The School Admin Never Follow Up With Parents.  Please Do Something!, The teacher Sue if I spell it correctly the one who teach Arabic is not suitable for kids .we came to enroll our child and told her he's active,  she said she can't be focusing on him as she has already other 5 kids and it's not childcare.she was also screaming on kids 3 times I heard her and saw her so we immediately hesitate to enrol our child., Kind, giving & responsible caretakers to trust our cherished little ones with.. always there to ease parents' worries whenever required."

And they‚Äôre very passionate about creating inclusive environments for children with special needs. Children learn to be more caring, inclusive and have lots of empathy on everybody‚Äôs differences and needs. A great school overall!, Both my kids were in this school. Really love the Teachers in this school, The owner of this school is my mom"
Baby Elk Infant Care Singapore,"Before Baby Elk, we always hear from people around us on how infant care is a nightmare where the kid will always fall sick. But I think we must have lucked out here because being in infant care was one of the best decision we‚Äôve made! I think it‚Äôs really the entire team behind the centre that makes all the difference. Our son started school when he was 3 months old and honestly, he didn‚Äôt cried and adapted super well. We saw how much our son loved school, to the extent that he cried on so many occasions when he was going home. He is probably the only child who isn‚Äôt happy seeing his parents at the door.. We love seeing the updates from school and knowing what activities he gets to do for the day. Daily updates were updated very promptly which gave us a peace of mind while we work. Thank you to the team once again for all the love! Caleb is indeed very lucky to have such a fun and great experience to start his school journey!  Will definitely recommend Baby Elk to anyone who is looking for an infant care around AMK/YCK area., We enrolled our daughter at baby elk when she was 8 months old and she recently graduated after 11 months there. It was a pleasure watching her grow under the teachers care. She was always happy when she comes home which reassured us that she was well taken care of. We want to thank the teachers and carers at baby elk for their attentive care and love towards our daughter. We wish them all the best and we were really lucky to have found them and to entrust our daughter there., It was indeed a great journey for us at Baby Elk. Our daughter learnt so many news skills at Baby Elk. In fact she first learned to say Daddy n Mummy, self feeding, so many art and craft work, basics of potty training and much more. We are thank full to all teachers ,also the staff at Baby elk who took good care of our daughterüôèüèºContinue doing all the great work., My daughter has been in Baby Elk since she was 3 months old, and I'm very grateful that the teachers have taken such good care of her, staff are attentive with updates and communication and all the activities (especially music class) have really been great for her development! I'm sure she'll miss her teachers a lot as she graduates and goes to playgroup!, My son has studied in Baby Elk Infant Care for last 2 years.  The staffs are patient and kind. They nurture the child very carefully like their own baby. They take the effort to pick up on child‚Äôs preferences. My son used to like the Child care more than home. The care owner is so friendly and caring towards the children. We recommend Baby Elk Infant care for all neighbourhoods!, My son was with Baby Elk when he was 8 months till 18 months. The teachers at Baby Elk are experienced, very caring and passionate! They put in a lot of efforts to organise fun learning activities for the children. My son really enjoys going to school every morning, full of smiles. I also get prompt updates from the school about his schedule daily which makes me feel very assured and at ease at work. My family and I are very grateful for their support and we will certainly miss the Baby Elk family!!!, My baby just graduated at 18 months and he really enjoyed going to school every day. Especially after the new Principal has come onboard (since Aug/Sep), there has been broader range of activities designed for children's development (and fun) - big thanks to Ms G! He will miss the teachers a lot!  Overall very happy with Baby Elk as teachers are very caring and attentive, and baby really enjoyed school!  On the side note, the experience on the registration process in the beginning was not optimal so this can be an area of improvement (e.g. clarity of documents required)!, This is a decent establishment that took good care of my son for 10 months. We enrolled him at 8 months and he graduated at 18 months to another school for playgroup. While at Baby Elk, he really enjoyed himself, developed good relationships with his classmates and teachers. I could see they genuinely adored and cared about him and I felt assured he would have a good day whenever I dropped him off., My son is with the school since he was 2 months + 3 months. There is nothing else i could complain about the school as compared to other mommy's experience. My mommy friends were staying quite a distance and were envious of my son's learning journey. So far, the teachers have been kind, professional, and we are very thankful towards the school. Behind each good school lies a team of extremely passionate teachers and babyelk did not disappoint us despite their turnover rate and what not. My son is happy there, we are happy with the teachers and the updates they gave us. Very appreciative towards the teachers dedicated care towards him. 7 more months to my sons graduation and i have no idea if I can get another preschool that is on par with this infant care..., Teachers took really good care of my baby. I always feel safe when my daughter is at the infant care. My baby is happy to see her teachers every morning and that made me feel more comfortable going to work knowing my child is happy. The teachers are so loving and caring., A safe place, whereby all the teachers took good care of my infant. Teachers are v fast n responsive to communicate with the parents.  Crucially, they are a very caring team and your infants are safe with them.  Thanks for taking very good care of baby pragathi and she truly enjoyed all the hands-on activities provided by the centre., We had an awesome experience letting our child be a part of Baby Elk infant care for 2 months when we really needed help with our 16 month old. Baby Elk is specialised for kids under 18 months and so the Teachers are well versed on taking care of kids this age. People around AMK and YCK please don‚Äôt hesitate to get their help in taking care of your kids if you need assistance., Baby Elk is a systematic and well managed infant care. Baby definitely safe in their hands. The teachers are well trained and will feedback to the parents of anything that need to be improved on to the baby in term of behaviour, health and learning ability. Keep it up! My 8 months old baby is very alert and and very eager to learn new things since putting here when 2 months old., Babyelk is a good infant care with professional teachers that always make sure our baby is well taken care. Got a lot activities on day time and really good for our baby growth and education. We as parents have peach of mind when put out baby there.  Thanks Babyelk üòä, They have a team of wonderful teachers who have been kind to my daughter. The principal also responds quickly when there is any problem/query. My daughter gained weight and crossed some centiles which I appreciate. Thank you very much., Thank you to the teachers at baby elk. The experience is good. I understand that due to safety and restrictions, it is best that parents are not allowed to enter the center. Hopefully this changes in the future., ** Updates: In response to the management's reply since I am unable to reply to it ** - 17th Sept 2020  Hi centre managers, thanks for your reply for this review. We noticed there are quite an amount of information which was left out in your reply. We will not pursue further, since you were adamant Baby Elk was entirely responsive, and you seem to be defensive against our constructive feedback.  I also appreciate acknowledging messages / calls after 6 business working days (as claimed by the centre). Perhaps its basic courtesy to acknowledged and not go missing (while claiming to check) and let parents know a response will be given by a certain date? I think no parents will appreciate messages sent but no reply for more than a week, made phone calls but no response, left messages to the principal at the centre for a return call but no response. The only response came few days after a google review was posted to ask me to listen to their breakdown and to remove my google review. I felt it was not necessary anymore because ECDA stepped in and assisted me with my enquiry.  Also having sufficient teachers does not meant the teachers could cope with the workload. Have been asked not once but twice if I had any recommendation for teachers who are interested to work there. Even part timers are welcomed. And there are few occasions when my baby showered only at 3pm and was told because they didnt had time. All these made me inferred they need more manpower. No?  Apart from that, I saw my baby sleeping on other babies' bed and using their pillows and blankets on 3 occasions. They had put her in the wrong bed and given her the wrong items. Other babies' bath towels were also packed into my baby's bag at times. To be honest, all of the above, I can wink it off because like I said, as long as my baby is ok. Humans make mistake and I feel that there is no need to pinpoint all the nitty-gritty things. However, if the centre is so defensive that they are providing their best already, then I feel the need to highlight that these issues should not have occurred.  For my whatsapp review as screenshot by the centre, I felt that they should screenshot with the date as well because what I said was much earlier before this whole lapse of response. To be honest, even at this point in time, I would still thank the teachers for guiding my baby and loving her.  There are too many more situations but I feel there is no point going on. If there are any parents who would like more information about our review, feel free to reply here and we will be happy to provide our personal experiences and the proof of which was left out in the centre‚Äôs reply to our review.  May 2020 Had an unpleasant journey dealing with the management of the IFC. It is tiring to constantly have to ask for updates when you have an enquiry to check on. At times, the response comes after a few days. At times, after a few weeks or completely ignored. This is especially so when it comes to refunding of the subsidy and deposit.  Prior to the recruitment, they were really pro-active in getting you to join. After which is a different story. There were many loopholes of unclear communications as well.  In terms of the educarers, I think there are definitely room for improvement. But I understand that the role of the educarer is not easy and they are constantly short of teachers so many things I choose to wink off as long as my baby is not injured., There has been no problem with Baby Elk. They are very reponsive to our enquiries. We feel at ease leaving our baby girl in their care., I would advise everyone to read their parents handbook before paying the deposit.  Hope EDCA can help with this teething issue, Teachers are very responsive and experienced in handling infants, and timely in answering queries. A rare but definitely great find for our family. Thank you Elk!, Teachers are cheerful! There are lots of engaging activities for the infants and they update the app in a timely manner. üëçüèΩüëçüèΩüòä ‚Ä¶, Caring and responsibility teachers at Baby Elks infant care.  Thank you for taking care of my son Isaac ., Best baby infant care in Sg, the service is soooo good, Teachers are inexperienced. Worst place ever!, recommended place to send kids, my baby is at safe hands, Good service"
Bedok Methodist Preschool SPARK Certification,"My son had a good learning experience in Bedok Methodist Preschool. The teachers are caring and the programmes are exciting., My children are happy to attend school at Bedok Methodist Preschool üòÅ That is the most important thing, that they are happy to go to school from Monday to Friday. The school has caring and experienced teachers under the guidance of Principal Mrs Wee. Parents are regularly invited to particpate in bonding sessions with their children such as cookery, reading day, Racial Harmony, Children's Day, etc. It is also good to note that the children learn about God and good values while at school. We are blessed to have children study and play there!  p.s.

The principal and teachers are very approachable and caring. My 2 kids enjoyed fun activities in school such as cookery classes, paper making activities, water play and hands on experiments etc. My kids look forward to going to school everyday. The termly show and tell experience since nursery also prepared my kids well for their show and tell in primary school.

My sons are thoroughly equipped not just with knowledge but ethical and Godly values imparted. It is definitely a school that you can entrust your child., I have been extremely pleased with Bedok Methodist Preschool since my daughter started attending in 2022. The teachers have consistently shown care, creating a positive environment for her to learn and grow. The termly outings have been a highlight for my daughter, and she eagerly anticipates them. Her enthusiasm for going to school is a clear testament to the school's quality.  What's more, the school's commitment to cleanliness and safety has made a noticeable impact on my daughter's health ‚Äì she falls sick less frequently since joining. I'd like to express my heartfelt gratitude to the school, especially to teachers Ms. Inez Chan, Wang laoshi, Ms. Rey, and Mrs. Yeo, for their unwavering patience and guidance in helping my daughter reach her fullest potential. Bedok Methodist Preschool has been a wonderful choice for our family, and we couldn't be happier with the care and education they provide., Great curriculum with a holistic approach - high standards of academics, inculcating good values with hands-on, outdoor classroom activities and cookery classes. Curriculum also encourages children to put on their thinking caps and also to have public speaking skills from a young age. Children also love the bible stories and worship songs learnt in school. Teachers are very helpful, caring and devoted. Parents are quite well informed regularly through the app. Children love the food served in the school., The teachers are kind and caring, the school environment is clean and conducive for learning both indoors and outdoors, and the curriculum is comprehensive. My daughter has learnt a lot since starting school at BMP and looks forward to going to school every day., Bedok Methodist Preschool has provided our children with excellent pre-school education.  We have sent both our children to BMP. My daughter is in primary school now and BMP prepared her well due to its comprehensive English, Mathematics and Mandarin programmes.  As parents, we were kept fully updated on the progress of our children in school. In fact, there were occasions when the teachers would voluntarily come and speak to us about our children both before and after school, in addition to the usual end-of-term updates.  The school has a very conducive learning environment and both my children enjoy(ed) going to BMP.  Most importantly, the teachers are caring and genuinely love the kids. I highly recommend BMP if you are looking for a place for your child to receive excellent pre-school education., We've sent our children to this school. Our eldest graduated in 2021 and we felt he was more than prepared to deal with P1. Our youngest started this year and he has drastically improved his speech and motor skills. We highly recommend this school to anyone., BMPS is a faith based school that helped instill such core values  & practices for my boys.  The teachers are positive, attentive and helpful towards parents and students. They tend to be more mindful with students that need additional help (behaviour or learning).  My eldest says to rate 1000,000 out of 5., A good preschool, part of the methodist network. They maintain a fine balance of study and extra curricular activities. Teachers are sympathetic and the Principal and non-academic stuff are also very helpful., My 3 girls are in this school. Their speech and motor skills have developed well through the course of time here. Thankful for the dedication and patience the teachers have which I believe have encouraged their learning., BMP puts serious thought and effort towards teaching and developing children, they are always open to feedback and to continuously improving. Highly recommended pre-school!, Both my kids going to BMP and they enjoy and love the time spent there for fun with continous learning., Love that my sons grew up in this place.

Bethesda (Ang Mo Kio) Kindergarten,"Enrolled my #2 & #3 after years of homeschooling with them. Being an educator myself, I've high expectations towards the ideal school selection. Bethesda has proven me likewise. Its holistic curriculum attracts me a great deal and their conducive learning environment soothes my heart whenever I pop by. Teaching is more than imparting knowledge. Their teachers are well-equipped with passion and take great interests in their students. Their ever ready reassuring words of encouragement give me sense of relief on my children's first day of school. Their admin, Ms Yun Ting, is always gentle and patience towards my tons of enquiries. Special thanks to Ms Faith, Ms Pam, Ms Chong and Yu Lao Shi for the assurance all these while. We are truly blessed to have all of you through their Kindy Journeys. God bless., The teachers are very caring, attentive and talented. Be it a mozzie bite on the hand, poor appetite, or change of class arrangements the teachers never fail to keep me in the know. The school sends out menu and lesson plans very timely and even printed out hard copies for busy parents to read. My son loves going to school and look forward to his daily outdoor, weekly gym and Aikido classes. In just a short two months he was able to give thanks for his food at home in mandarin, I was so surprised given that we don't say a word of prayer using Chinese. He will often come home singing worship songs and telling me stories he learnt in school. Seeing his knowledge and faith grew brought us much joy.  Lastly a special thanks to Ms Jacqueline (Principal) for standing in the hot sun to direct the traffic at the gate during this period with Covid tighten measures in placed. She has truly demonstrated servant leadership for all and her love for little children never fail to impress me. She remembers the little ones she holds at the school gate by name and is very sensitive to their emotional needs., I was from this kindergarten back in the year 2013. I remember having a lot of fond memories there, it was a wonderful school., Lovely and caring teachers, the principal greets the students everyday at the gate and remembers all the children‚Äôs names. Kudos to the nurturing and dedicated team!, Well rounded curriculum!"
Bethesda (Katong) Kindergarten,"The kindergarten teachers here are so amazing and caring! And they remember all the children's names, wonderful!, I will never forget this place, this playground  ‚ò∫Ô∏èüôèüèªüôèüèªüôèüèª ‚Ä¶, Best teachers and staff here, Good morning, Teacher Zeng! Very caring and loving teachers, highly recommended!, A student who fundamentally rejected religion"
Bethesda (Pasir Ris) Kindergarten,"Only discovered this kindergarten when I decided to pull my younger child out of childcare in K1. Regretted not sending her in earlier and not sending my elder one in.  We are in the roots and wings program (6 hour program) and on top of the extensive curriculum, enrichment is included like music, sports ball, art and speech and drama. The holistic curriculum also let them learn through play via relating real life items like trees and rocks with learning, and includes creative thinking skill. Indoor and outdoor play is also included as part of the curriculum. There is an in-house aunty who does the cooking and my daughter takes multiple bowls.  The teachers are very caring and the whole environment is very loving. The education itself is secular in nature so no issues as we are not Christian.  My daughter looks forwards to school everyday and it is wonderful to see her enjoying herself so much. I only lament not finding this school earlier and hopefully she will adjust well to primary school after such a wonderful time at kindergarten., Children are exhibiting disruptive behavior in public, being loud and rowdy even. Parents are turning a blind eyes and engage in their own conversation., My son is currently in Bethesda Pasir Ris Kindergarten. I loved how systematic the school curriculum is. The school managed to rise above the situation even during this pandemic. The teachers are so passionate and really anointed to be a teacher most especially Mrs. Sim. She is so loved by her students. Keep up the good work!What I think they should improve is their website because actually they have a good curriculum and enrichment programs but it did not really give justice on their website. I just chose this school because of the good feedback from my friends but if not for word of mouth and if I will depend on their website I might choose other schools. Especially now, parents would love to check  the website first. But this is highly recommended, We have chosen BPRK for our little one from pre-nursery and currently nursery. Surely we will continue until K2. Loving the teaching and not teaching staffs, they are very caring and are genuinely loving the kids. Their enrichment classes are excellent too. My daughter loves the art class. They make the school events well organised as well. Overall, the school helped our little one develop good habits and a great attitude apart of academic knowledge., Bethesda (Pasir Ris) Kindergarten is where my daughter spend a part of her formative years in. Even though the journey to the Kindergarten require a certain amount of time from Tampines, the teaching team has been awesome. As a whole, they are very conscientious, responsible and accountable. My daughter had a great time there so much so that she has even attended gatherings during festive seasons even after she has graduated from the Kindergarten. These positive characteristics far outweigh it's location - and we are more than willing to spend that little bit more time, to travel there for activities, whenever we can., BPRK has a very special place in my heart, as both my kids went there. It has given them the foundation in knowledge as well as keeping their faith in their early years. I can see how my girl has grown, physically and spiritually. I love the time the children sing praises in the morning and listen to the Word.  BPRK has been teaching my kids well. All the lessons are planned carefully and the curriculum has prepared my kids well for the Primary School. Their transition to Primary School have been smooth, without any difficulty at all. The teachers are all so dedicated, and has put so much effort in teaching the lessons as well as emphasizing in proper manners. Keep up the good work BPRK! ^^, Teachers and principle are warm and engaging. My son used to cry and vomit before entering his former preschool but he settles in very well once we switched to BPRK!  He loves his teachers and principal and can't wait to go to school every day.  Glad that i make the right choiceüòä ‚Ä¶, One of the best! My 3 daughters are students here since pre-nursery level. A school is only as great as its people - and Mrs June Hannah Ee, the school Principal and her team of teachers & assistants are superb. Especially my girls' teachers Mrs Lim & Mrs Wong, Mrs Sim & Mrs Liau, they are very loved by the students. The teachers here are passionate, patient & respectful; they really pay great attention & care to each child's development. The school's curriculum is richly infused with activities like lifestyle learning projects, multi-sports and pretend play fun days (ie. pyjama party, rainy day). The biggest tell-factor is that my girls absolutely love going to school everyday & they come home singing songs and learning new things. Highly recommended., My son was having his K2 year here. Location wise is very convenience as it is close to our home, the education standard is also great. . The teachers were caring, dedicated, passionate and approacheable.  We had great experiences here before our son went to his Primary School.  Highly recommended!!, If I can only say one sentence, I'd say, I'm happy with Bethesda Kindergarten. At first, I sent my first one to Bethesda because of the good reviews i read, and because of the fact that the school had a big hall and open air classrooms. I liked this good air circulation classroom cause my first one was easily sick when he was younger.  Once he studied there, he enjoyed his kindie time. Teachers were very nice, and liked to give words of encouragement. Not only that, the interaction in school let the kids built friendship that continues up until now.  My second one is still studying at Bethesda. The opposite of her brother, she was a very shy and quite girl. Thankfully, she manages to talk and speak more as she grows in the environment that supports her. The curriculum taught in the kindie has been done in interesting ways, and they learn a lot from the play-and-learn program. I'd say, the kindie prepares them very well for primary school.  In short, I'm happy with the kindergarten., My Elder son completed Kindergarten graduation from Bethesda Pasir ris. And presently younger son also learning from same school.  We are very happy with school interms of School campus,  Kind and co-operating teachers and staff.  There Root-Wings prgram.(6hr),  makes kids very happy to engage.  There innovative methods to keep kids undertstand methods and all learnings..  School also runs some activities for parents can engage with kids and school lovely bonding formed with Bethesda. Recommends parents visit and see the school. You will never regret ur decisions., It's a rarity to find kindergarten that can uphold the human touch, sustain organic learning approaches and nurture students with the heart ‚ù§ Everybody (both teaching and non-teaching) exemplary in his/her role. Definitely a rare gem in Singapore! üíé ‚Ä¶, A really homely and family orientated kindergarten. Teachers are genuine and concern. They answer to queries promptly ! My girl loves going to school and respect the teachers very much!, Wonderful, family feel with dedicated teachers and low turnover. The teachers engage the kids in interesting and creative ways, making learning fun!, I feel really lucky to get through BPRK for my daughter , highly dedicated staff , friendly and happy environment for kids , I am greatfull from all of my heart to BPRK and staff to give my daughter best of kindergarten school days üòÄ ‚Ä¶, Bethesda (Pasir Ris kindergarden) is also a church with kindergarden in operation..yes is located at the junction of Pasir Ris drive 3 and drive 2 near to Loyang Point shopping mall...you can reach this location by coming from any part of Singapore in private or public transport is not so convenient to come by bus..only bus no 3 dropping at Pasir Ris street 21 first bus stop from Pasir Ris Drive 2 turning..a walking distance of about 10 minutes....see you there..., Teachers are very kindly, and the enrichment lessons are very good., Caring teachers, up-to-date curriculum, interactive teaching., Great teachers with interesting teaching methods"
Blossom Creative Centre (Bedok),"We just had the K2 graduation.  Before my thankfulness fades..  Thank you teachers n aunties for all your love n patience for these kiddos.. my boy has indeed blossomed in the short 1yr 9mths he's there.  Not a single complaint during ptm.. tho I know my boy is bit of a tough cookie.. and whenever I feedback about any negative emotions my boy had abt school,  teacher wei en n Qi laoshi will always take time to observe n guide him/ class along.  Thank you all, teachers n aunties of BLOSSOM creative .. it takes a village to raise a child.. and BLOSSOM creative has been that village for me..  My boy joined early K1.. had lots of complaint from previous childcare teacher n principal.  One negative is I felt the hfmd cases is bit too much.. but it could be after effect of CoV .. just put in additional UV sanitising etc.., Knowing that finding a good school for early childhood development is an important decision a parent has to make, I praise myself lucky to have found Blossom Creative Centre. In all my interactions with the management and the teachers, they have been very friendly, supportive, responsive and professional, but foremost my children's learning curiosity is constantly being sparked, and they love to go to school every single day., Grateful to have found this school!! Since 2018, I have sent my first born to this school; Management, teachers and staff are kind, dutiful, extremely responsive, engages 2 ways communication pro-actively with parents and amazing when coaching my children with life skills; toilet training, dental hygiene etc.  When we moved house in 2019, due to the distance we changed to a school closer to our new place and boy, did we regret! Within 1 month, despite the distance, we‚Äôve sent my first born and now even my second born to Blossom creative centre @ bedok! 4 years now‚Ä¶ both my kids are enjoying their time at blossom!  I highly recommend this school who takes parents‚Äô feedback seriously and plays an active role to engage parents. As such, I feel assured and focus at work knowing that my kids are in good hands. Thank you Management and staff of Blossom!, My eldest graduated half a year ago and my youngest is still with Blossom. They enjoy Blossom tremendously. I love fetching them from Blossom, listening to them chat about what they learn and enjoy in school. My eldest really struggled with phonics in her kindy years and her form teacher worked closely with me to support her in grasping reading. She was aware of my eldest‚Äôs introverted personality and took into consideration of that while teaching her. My girl breezed through reading by graduation. Blossom is also aware of the struggle parents have with Chinese language and has done up a solid curriculum to help children transit to P1 Chinese well. My eldest still enjoys singing with her younger sister of the Chinese songs and poems her blossom teachers have taught her. Blossom teachers really make learning fun for them! Academic aside, the thing that really stands out for me for Blossom is the teachers. They are warm and caring and are often able to quickly give feedback on my children whether it is during PTM or casual chatting during pick up, which reflect their understanding and love for my children. My younger girl is a slow eater and gets stressed when her peers finish before her. She would tell me how her teacher assures and comforts her during meal time. This was also communicated to me by the teachers. This is but one of the many examples of the care the teachers take in my children. I highly recommend this school to anyone who appreciate a well thought-out curriculum and management and teachers who are always ready to listen and work with parents., My daughter has been enrolled in the school for more than a year since toddlerhood. Loving and dedicated teachers and staff. Good hygiene and security practices as well, which I appreciate. Good communication with parents, holistic progress report and teacher-child ratio. My daughter loves school. Highly recommend., This is a very well-run school with clear management and structure as well as a deep passion and love for kids and their education. My daughter‚Äôs passion for life, school, the teachers and her school friends say it all. Blossom is exactly what kids do at this school. Our daughter has been attending since 2018, we love Blossom Creative Bedok and could not recommend more highly. Not convinced? Please read about our experience ÔÅä  Finding a school for your playgroup/kindergarten age child can be incredibly stressful. I have 4 kids and each time round I was just as nervous. My youngest was not. She was adamant she wanted to go to Blossom Creative Centre Bedok. She had seen it walking past and was sure that is where she wanted to go. I arranged to see the school and was convinced in 30 seconds that she had made a super choice. A very well thought out syllabus, clear objectives but also a more holistic approach ensuring kids get play, art, music and fun too. Her first day she walked in and didn‚Äôt even look back. Every day I pick her up and ask ‚Äúhow was your day?‚Äù her reply is ‚Äúgreat!‚Äù. She is on a half day but some days asks to do a long day she has so much fun.  Blossom really was the greatest find!  The location is such a wonderful space, with a garden to play, a nice welcoming entrance and Teachers that greet with warm and wonderful smiles. Even through COVID the community feel/support between parents and the school has been beyond words.  We love the Teachers! Their personal touch and effort to build relationships is evident from how my daughter adores them but their passion does not stop there. They use creative ways to teach the kids; music, activities, games, and crafts. So much effort goes into what they do. Even with COVID the Teachers have found ways to work within the restrictions and safely, but give the kids experiences they love and will remember.  From role play to experience what life is like as an older person to learning about the ocean and making paper jellyfish, self expression, singing, cooking, dancing, writing, reading, numbers, Mandarin, science, computers, physical education and more; Blossom Creative have it covered.  Having been there for a few years now I can vouch for their approach. My child has learnt more than I could have imagined. She comes home telling me facts that even my older kids don‚Äôt know. She loves reading and writing because Blossom Creative make it fun and have given her great ways to apply what she has learnt. We love the bilingual approach they take and the standard of teaching that ensures the kids learn what they need to.  When you find your 5yr old trying to spell words like Salamander as she sings to herself a made-up song with facts about salamanders, just for fun and then breaks into a song in Mandarin you know they have the balance right. I have seen her grow in independence, academics but also her own self. Blossom Creative gives little ones a safe space to learn and grow with confidence., My daughter joined Blossom when she was 17 months old (PG). She is now in K1 and we are very happy with the overall experience with the school over the past few years with the way they teach and the way they take care of the kids. Highly recommended!, It is very disheartening for me to write the following review for the childcare that had been taking care of my child. When I first decided to leave my child there, the teachers were friendly and demonstrated professionalism in taking care of the children. There were regular feedback and also well establish curriculum.  However, lately there were quite a few teachers who left and replaced by new ones. The teachers were not only rude but also lacks passion to teach. They tend to chit chat among themselves while leaving the children to play. The most disappointing part is that there are some teachers who literally ignore you when we are there to pick up our children. Such behaviours are disappointing for a childcare who is responsible to take care and teach our next generation., Have been sending all my 3 kids to Blossom They all love the teachers there."
Blossom Discovery Centre (Serangoon),"Blossom Discovery Center is a fantastic neighbourhood day care center. We had our daughter there for 2 years (K1 & K2), she has been very happy and we are now confident she has built some strong foundations to enter Primary school. Teachers and staff are all very kind and take great care of all the children, they really put their heart into their job. Classes are small (8 kids this year in K2) which gives a lot of attention to every single child. A lot of outings and optional activities too all year long. Special thanks to Mrs Khoo, Teacher Remah and Zheng Lao Shui :), We had a difficult situation with our son's previous school as he was unable to adapt even after 2months of school. We decided to enrol him to BD in May after Mr Lawrence's  very clear and indepth intro to BD. We're pleasantly surprised that he was able to adapt quickly. Teacher Aby and Meishan Laoshi have always been keeping us updated on his health and progress. We are glad to have teachers and school environment that is very warmly welcoming and encourage active participation for parents and students. Kudos BD!"
Blossom Fantasia Centre (Loyang),Its a great school in this locality.Teachers are very friendly and understanding.
BlueTree Education (Choa Chu Kang),"My child joined BlueTree (CCK) in August this year. I'd like to express my appreciation for the team there; they are consistently cheerful and supportive.  Her Science EYE Sci results is 59 out of 80. While the score may not be exceptional, I am truly thankful for the progress I've seen, especially in her attitude towards her studies. In my opinion, this is the most crucial aspect of her education.  During SA1, she struggled with her Science test, but with the guidance and support of Teacher Wendy, she regained her confidence in the subject. Now, she not only enjoys attending her classes but also enthusiastically requests Chinese tuition at BlueTree. ‚ù§Ô∏è  Before her EYE, I assessed her Science knowledge verbally and noticed that she was quick and accurate but needed to work on articulating her answers in which I'm confident that Tr Wendy will continue to drill her.  I am grateful to BlueTree for the dedication and positive impact on my child's education. Thank you. ‚ù§Ô∏è, My child who just started science with BlueTree in Aug this year with CCK branch. He loves the lessons and looks forward for class every week. There are interesting experiments and fun games that Teacher Wendy used to make the lesson interesting and engaging., Fun and experimental education centre. Friendly warm environment with experienced teachers. My girl looking forward to her weekly lesson üòä ‚Ä¶, Good tution"
Bridging Stars Childcare Pte Ltd,"I‚Äôm Immensely happy to take a moment to express my gratitude for the wonderful care and support provided by the team of teachers in Bridging stars, & especially to teacher Wendy for always giving me the best feedback and advices on my boy!  From the engaging activities to the attentive staff, that every aspect of your center is designed with the well-being and development of the children in mind  Highly recommend anyone to sign up with this school for your kid‚Äôs education!  Thank you for all that you do to make a school a place where children can grow, learn, and feel safe. We're so grateful for everyone in Bridging stars!, It was my best choice choosing BSC for my daughter, originally from Myanmar, and she could not communicate verbally in English at her first day of school. Now she improves a lot in her communication skills in English. My girl loves to go to school everyday actively. Teachers are very patient and gentle to the kids. School rooms are clean and hygiene. Love üòç, Truly the light during our datkest times, looking for a suitable school for our son with ASD was truly a challenging moment in out lives but Bridging Stars, Ms Fadhilah to be exact, were empathetic, understanding and sensitive to our situation. It was a blessing to receive that call. Thus to encourage the teachers in this trying and challenging times with the current issue going on in the ECH sector, we hope that the teachers do not feel discouraged to continue impacting little lives in Bridging Stars! Working with children is already challenging enough, let alone to give your utmost care, love and guidance to kids like Ziyaad. From the bottom of our heart, we can never thank you enough for being a part in Ziyaad's life.  Here are the written messages that is for all of you amazing teachers!  ‚ù§Ô∏è Thank you for all the love and care that you've given to Ziyaad!  ‚ù§Ô∏è Thank you for giving Ziyaad the opportunity to learn and enjoy school like other kids!  ‚ù§Ô∏è Thank you for providing Ziyaad a *safe* space to learn and grow! üå±  ‚ù§Ô∏è Thank you for being such a patient individual! The work that you've done will never go unnoticed. Ziyaad and all of Ziyaad's family members truly appreciate  √º!  ‚ù§Ô∏è It takes a BIG heart to help shape little minds! Thank you for making a difference in Ziyaad's learning journey!  ‚ù§Ô∏è A child with special needs will inspire you to be a special kind of person. Ziyaad is truly fortunate and blessed to have you!  We hope we are not too late to wish all of you Happy Teachers Day! ü´∞üèæ  ‚ù§Ô∏è Yusoff and Zahara, BSC has been an integral part of my daughter's growth, from a 20-month-old child, when she was unable to communicate verbally, to the confident, talkative and - most importantly - kind and loving person she is today.  I especially adore: - the teacher's approach in resolving conflict between the children - the way they instil kindness and do-your-best mindset in their daily activities - the healthy meal they prepare for my child  Their approach in educating the children is aligned with our approach at home, and very often we are also exchanging notes on how we should tackle certain issues pertaining to our child's behavior.  Great childcare is not just about looking after children, it should be an extension of the family - where the teacher and other staff members, from those that prepare meals to those that manage and run the centre, put in extra effort to ensure the children get the love and care they need. BSC has proven to be a great place for my child to play, learn, grow, and practice mindfulness and kindness., A unpleasant stay for my son for the last year in K2 2019. Son have told be twice in year 2019 that he doesn't wan to go to the child care. When check with teacher they will just throw the problem back to the children. Principle can't solve small issue and keep changing every year also rude to the child's parent. Have transfer my 2nd child to other childcare but the elder son was the last year in childcare in class K2 so did not really need to change. Given me a 2nd chance to put there again I will think maybe not., Love the teachers, principal, staffs and Ms Yen Yen they are all so kind and caring., Nice environment for kids to grow"

It was great to see that some teachers had been there for long time, indicating that the working environment is good and good retention by the principal. The school has also been awarded with healthy preschool for their balanced diet meals.

Brighton Montessori @ Crystal Court,"My 2 year old daughter had spent 1and half months in this school and left with a deep scar on the middle of her forehead. The hurt was deep to bone and the scar will be permanent . The school admitted that my daughter was tripped over by a teacher in the class room and bumped to a hard angle of the chair. This incident happened in May. Up to now, no apology has been given. The school regard it as an accident hardly to avoid. No compensation has been given by the school to cover any of the 15thousand medical cost. And the school is trying to sue a heart-broken mother for posting this incident on social media. And they regard this as ‚Äú a deformation of reputation‚Äù . No comment but to tell the fact. Wish every parent to be cautious to this school., Was fine until we got a new Form Teacher for K2, who could not speak or write proper English (eg mixing up gender, and singular vs plural terms), and made frequent marking mistakes in both Eng and Math.  Felt she was hardworking and caring though, and perhaps could make a good Mandarin teacher.  But, learnt later that inappropriate remarks were made to the children, that could terrify or scare them (about throwing them out, etc).. Seriously inadequate carpark facilities, esp after merger with GreatWorld branch. Imagine total of more than 100 children, in a facility with only 8 outdoor lots (no shelter), out of which, 6 lots are located dangerously close to the canal, and laden with uneven or broken concrete slabs and stones all around (my child fell at a lot and got injured once). Despite numerous reminders not to throw anything, they still lost some of my child's work and craft done at school (6 out of 8 items I tried to get, were lost, guess thrown away) :( Overall, not worth the high fees, as even the government or government-related centres had teachers who spoke and taught better Eng, and who displayed more sincerity.  Here, no viable action was done to rectify the issue of the lack of Eng standards in a kindergarten level teacher who taught Eng and Math, and not a single word of apology was given to address the fact that changing school in the middle of the final yr of kindergarten posed so much hassle to us., Great environment, very supportive teachers. My child is having an amazing experience."
Brighton Montessori Centres Pte Ltd (190 Ang Mo Kio Avenue 8),"In a span of a 4 months plus, my son learns so much from this school! Great early childcare education and attentive Teachers! Great job!, All very good! The teachers are also very professional and the children are becoming more and more confident! It‚Äôs just that the playground could use more facilitiesüòÅ ‚Ä¶"
Brighton Montessori Centres Pte Ltd (Mountbatten),"As a parent deeply invested in providing a holistic and enriching educational experience for my child, enrolling them in a Montessori school has been a game-changer. The Montessori philosophy is not just a method of education; it's a transformative journey that fosters independence, creativity, and a love for learning.  One of the standout features of our Montessori experience is the child-centric approach that permeates every aspect of the curriculum. The classrooms are carefully designed to stimulate curiosity and exploration. The materials used are not just tools for learning; they are gateways to discovery. Watching my child engage with the carefully crafted Montessori materials, I can see the joy and enthusiasm that comes with hands-on learning.  The teachers at our Montessori school play a pivotal role in creating a nurturing environment. They act as guides, fostering a sense of responsibility and self-discipline. The emphasis on respecting each child's pace of development has allowed my child to progress at their own speed, building a strong foundation for future academic success.  What sets Montessori apart is the emphasis on practical life skills. From pouring their own juice to cleaning up after themselves, children are encouraged to take ownership of their actions. This not only instills a sense of responsibility but also enhances fine and gross motor skills. Witnessing my child confidently tackle daily tasks has been immensely rewarding.  The community aspect of Montessori education cannot be understated. The mixed-age classrooms encourage collaboration and mentorship among students. Younger children learn from their older peers, while the older ones reinforce their understanding by teaching. This dynamic fosters a sense of community and creates a supportive learning environment.  Communication between parents and teachers is open and transparent. Regular parent-teacher meetings provide insights into our child's progress, allowing us to actively participate in their educational journey. The Montessori school doesn't just educate children; it educates parents, creating a partnership that enhances the overall learning experience.  In conclusion, our Montessori experience has been nothing short of exceptional. It goes beyond traditional education, nurturing the whole child ‚Äì mind, body, and spirit. The emphasis on independence, hands-on learning, and community engagement sets Montessori apart as a beacon of educational excellence. If you're seeking an educational journey that inspires a love for learning and prepares your child for a lifetime of success, a Montessori education is undoubtedly worth considering., Both my children have been blessed to have studied at Brighton Montessori. The teachers have been amazing and I always felt that the staff goes an extra mile to contribute to overall development of the child, mentally, physically and emotionally. Special shout out to Ms. Audrea, Ms. Yatea and Ms. Fai! We all love you, 1. The centre changed/cancelled the contract with both parents without my knowledge/consent and contracted with the mother only. 2. The centre failed to comply with the Early Childhood Development Centres Regulations by rescinding its acceptance of my written authorisation for the paternal grandmother to pick up my child. 3. The centre failed to comply with the Early Childhood Development Centres Regulations and did not provide information relating to my child‚Äôs safety and welfare. 4. The centre did not respond to my request to enter into contract to pay for school fees and terminated the contract (with the mother only) for non-payment of school fees. 5. The centre did not respond to my correspondence dated 9 March 2020, 11 March 2020, 20 March 2020 and 31 December 2020."
Brighton Montessori International Pre-School @ Frankel,"Not a very good place for kids. My son was there and the teachers mediocre. One file costs $6 ! Just a normal file for kids to put papers.  The teachers were not exactly well qualified too compared to other schools.  Every thing is just money money money. If the school has outings and you are not keen to let them go also cant. U r advised to keep your child at home., Good principal"
Brighton Montessori International Pre-School @ Sunset,"Just had a visit to this school, not an authentic Montessori school. Mostly doing group teachings. No traditional 3hr work cycle. Mainly using Montessori material to help with academics development eg English and Math. And K2 is heavy with primary school prep. Most teachers do not hold Montessori diploma, just in house training. Chinese teacher is not even Montessori trained., Brighton Montessori has exceeded all my expectations. The care and support the teachers have provided my child with is beyond expectations. Definitely the best school I have chosen to give my child a great foundation."
Bukit Panjang Methodist Church Kindergarten,"A good and affordable kindergarten with caring teachers and conducive environment. Highly recommended for parents who want their kids to grow in a loving and warm environment., A great school! Newly renovated. Really great dedicated teachers and lovely conducive environment.

My son has made a lot of progress."
Calvary Pandan Kindergarten,"One of the best Christian school for pre-nursery to kindergarten with a strong focus on the word and foundational teachings. Teachers are very dedicated. Facilities are good and built with many safety aspects for children. Price is also very reasonable and affordable. This little known gem is a very rare find. For example, Christmas is taught to the children based on biblical doctrine and not around Santa Claus and partying., Went to this school for kindergarten, as well as for a 2 night camp when I was 8. We had a barbeque outside and I left my water bottle in one of the rooms inside the school/church. It was dark inside because everyone was outside and the lights inside were turned off, so I asked one of the teachers (whom I knew from when I was in kindergarten) to accompany me to get my bottle. She told me to get it myself and I said I didn't want to because I was scared and it was creepy inside (I was 8). She said coldly 'how dare you call god's house creepy?' and made me enter the dark school all alone and scared. Turned me away from god and religion growing up, and made me distrust teachers in general., So close to home for my grand children to learn about The Almighty God of the heavens."
Cambridge @ Artra Alexandra,"Zachary had a wonderful time during his time spent at Cambridge. He has learnt to be more independent and care for others as well. Special thanks to the teachers at Cambridge!, Thanks Cambridge Artra for an awesome two years for my girl! She loved the teachers especially Ms Tina and Liu Lao Shi and her friends too. We didn‚Äôt have to worry much about the transition to primary school as the foundation provided made it quite seamless. Generally quite well rounded curriculum., My son stared with them since K1. I must say the teachers are dedicated and very welcoming. The curriculum also was very forward thinking. Small class size which means more focuses on the kids.  Thank you a Ms Tina and Shi Lao Shi!, my daughter started at cambridge pre school (artra) at the age of 2, this was her first experience of an educational setting. The school teachers are very caring and loving towards the children. I found that principal Aisyah puts a lot of effort with all parents, she makes time to speak to parents should they have any issues or queries or even just a chin wag. I must put out a big shout out to Teacher sasa who has had a huge impact on my daughter and she still talks about her lovingly. The administrator Celine is incredibly organised and has everything in order without fail. I personally have had interactions with all staff at cambridge and felt they have been very warm overall, my daughter loves to mention aunty hua and aunty tra, the food is fresh, healthy and yummy and the school is always clean. I would recommend cambridge artra to any parent feeling unsure about their children's first pre school, My child has been so happy with the teachers and learning here. Highly recommend all the teachers especially Teacher Tina.  Thank you!, We are a family who need to relocate every few years. Going to a new school and making new friendship is never easy. Remembering the time we moved to Singapore, my girl was quite stressed about the new school. I am extremely grateful that Miss Tina and Liu Lao Shi guided her patiently. After 1.5 years in Cambridge, she could read and write both simple English and Chinese. It was very helpful for to get ready for primary school. More than academics, there are many interesting events in school. I was very thankful to see my girl transformed during her time in Cambridge.  Now my little boy is in K2 lessons, he has good relationship with his friends, and always surprises me with what he learned from school. Unfortunately we will relocate again soon. He won't be able to attend his graduation in Cambridge. I believe he will miss life in Cambridge, just like my girl."

Cambridge @ Fernvale Pte Ltd,"My son‚Äôs transition from infant to toddler was very well managed under the care of the teachers. They take 2 weeks to slowly transition them, updating us how it went. The teachers know each child well and there is good communication among the teachers. My daughter is also at the infant bay. They all love to attend the school at Fernvale‚Ä¶ I guess they have loving teachers and great programs even at their small ages., Both my kids attended Cambridge. When my son attended playgroup he couldn‚Äôt even say a word and was so baby-ish. But I am so grateful that the teachers were able to support and encourage him that he is able to speak in sentences now and is able to follow instructions so well.  My daughter was in N2 and I have seen a big difference in her attitude. She loved going to school and would share that school was fun. She learnt a lot during the time she was there.  Cambridge has a well balanced curriculum which makes each day exciting for the children. Their outdoors sessions from soccer to playground allows the children to enjoy the classroom while allowing them to also release that extra energy outdoors., My child has been attending ifc here since he was 4 months plus and he loves going to school! Teachers are nurturing and patient, and I can tell that they genuinely care for my child. I get updates about my child on an almost daily basis. They have also put in alot of effort in engaging the children in activities., My boy transferred from another ifc in yck area to here and we can see the positive differences here. The teachers really put effort to get the infants engaged and comfortable. they are patient with my boy who can be quite handful. There are many activities planned for them as well. Initially my boy had separation anxiety but now he is adjusting so well, no more tears during drop-off and full of smiles when i pick him up as well, which is really assuring for parents. The teachers will share updates regularly too and during pickups, they will also update if they noted anything different with my boy during the day., A big compliment to the infant care teachers whom really go the extra mile in taking care my sons from 4 to 18 months! The teachers are very caring towards their need and always engaging the infants in many creative and different activities. Big shout-out to Teacher Lina, Celine, Tham lao shi, Tina and Sharon. You are the unsung heros but your efforts are super appreciated by working parents like us :), My kid was with them 14 months in their infant care. And my experience with them was a very good one! If there's anyone who is looking for infant care in Fernvale area, I would strongly recommend this center. Very caring, loving teachers (Especially for the classroom for age 2-12 months) who makes my kid loves going to school. I especially want to compliment Teacher Tina, who always maintain very good communication with parents. Never forget to thank other teachers, Fu Laoshi (who has left the center), Mei Laoshi and Teacher Celine (Who is new, but very loving and caring!!), My child has had a wonderful time at Cambridge@Fernvale, especially after Teacher Cynthia and Zhu Lao shi has taken over. We are very appreciative of everything the school has done for her in the past year and we have seen her grown and developed tremendously in many ways., used to be very good, but terrible after changed Tr and PP. irresponsible as long waitlist anyway, Very good quality nice relatively innocuous"
Cambridge @ Kingsford Waterbay Pte Ltd,"The dedicated and caring staff go above and beyond to create a positive and nurturing atmosphere for the children.

Very happy with the academic progress for my children, they have each hone their own strengths with the teachers‚Äô guidance. And the teachers are not only focused on academics but also prioritizes on conduct and care for the children., Decent school, decent experience I have w them. Different kinds of activities to support kids development in art, music, emotional expression and love for outdoors. Class culture of helping parents w arrangements for bdays celebration. Lots of colours to kid life esp during various festive occasions. I have also observed much less attrition w teachers, which is good stabilising factor for child. Teachers will also provide biannual parent-teacher conference and photos / messages thru their app. But beware of fees. Pre- and thru covid years of low inflation, increases were ~5%. Then this year, asked increase is almost 20%. Also always giving forms asking for more payment for books, gift exchange, excursions, graduation ceremony etc.  In summary, decent school, Very strong chinese curriculum embedding AI in their learning. The school prepares them well for pri sch with weekly Âê¨ÂÜô and spelling in k2. Not just an academic school, there are also many exposures to play, family bonding activities and even robotics competitions etc. Swimming lessons every friday morning in the condo is also part of the curriculum for k1 and k2. My girl is in Cambridge kingsford from PG to k2 this year, all the teachers and principal Val we come across are very responsive, patient, mindful and of high standard. My daughter loves going to school and her friends so much. Our graduating k2 cohort of kids turns out to be all brave, confident, outspoken and kind individuals, best decision we have ever made sending our daughter here !, The school is very organised in terms of the programs arranged for the children at different levels. They used up to date technology such as AI and various softwares for children to do self study. Teachers are dedicated in what they do and handles every situations professionally., Best decision I have made for my baby. We started from infant care and it has been 3 amazing years and counting! The Teachers took care of my child well and she learnt a lot of skills. Parenting tips is also a bonus for me. To date, my daughter still has a close bond to her infant care and nursery teachers and this shows how much care and love they have given to her. I can never thank you enough and strong recommend this school!, My daughter started from infant care and now in toddler class. Best decision I ever made. Teachers took good care of her and she learn a lot from school. She always update me what she did in class and sing the songs she learn from class. My daughter loves all her teachers and friends., Fortunately, my son transferred to this school in K1 this year.  He learned very little from his previous school, and here he has made great progress.  But what is also unexpected and happy is that he has established a good relationship with friends and teachers in just a few months.  He is naughty, but the teachers give him a lot of patience, he likes the school environment and the teachers very much., My son has been with Cambridge Kingsford since 17m old and he has enjoyed and learned so much from school. He loves to practice his mandarin and sing mandarin songs which is pretty awesome as he comes Fr an English speaking environment. The materials from their parent company Ednovation is also very good. We are leaving Cambridge Kingsford with a heavy heart as we are shifting residences. We would like to thank the teachers for their commitment, patience and guidance to our son who has been with him since his Day 1 in school all the way to N2. Thank you Cambridge Kingsford for laying a foundation of learning for him and being his first ever friends and teachers ., Enrolling my daughter into the school has been a decision that we do not regret. She thinks the world of her teachers and we know that she is in an environment that she feels comfortable and safe in. Always grateful for the way her teachers acknowledge and celebrate the small successes and milestones while fostering and encouraging the larger ones., My son enrolled here since 8.5 months.

She is happy to go to school every morning and we can see her good progress after joining this school.Dedicated and lovely teachers., Infantcare really not nice. maybe just the teacher who take care my baby is not good.

Next week send to school got it again.really irresponsible!, My daughter goes to infantcare here. I feel that the teachers here genuinely care for the infants and my girl always comes home tired (in a good way) after school., Great preschool! The principal and teachers are ever so attentive to every children to their growing needs while preparing them well for their primary school years., Great, thoughtful & concerned teachers & principal that really focus on your child's development!, Great school with dedicated teachers, My boy was in their infant care for about one month. It was a terrible experience. My blacklist infant care for sure.  not recommend., Good experience so far., We couldn't be happier with our experience at Cambridge Preschool Kingsford Waterbay. Our child started school 3 months ago in Toddler class. From the warm and caring principal and teachers, to the engaging curriculum, our child enjoys and thrives there. Communication with parents is excellent, keeping us informed and involved every step of the way. We highly recommend Cambridge Preschool to any parent looking for a nurturing and educational environment for their child., Both children study in this school, and the teachers here are very serious and responsible. The hardware facilities and teaching staff are very strong. The children like the teachers here very much. There is a lot of content taught here. Don‚Äôt worry about studying"
Cambridge @ MacPherson,"My son attended Cambridge since he was in infant care till he was 3yo. The teachers were very nurturing and approachable. Since he has eczema, they took extra care with his food allergies and skin care (applying creams for him and managing his itch). The teachers put in a lot of effort to be creative in the activities that they expose the children to and to make it as fun as possible!  Teachers often updated us on his progress in school and were detailed in explaining what they covered during the term for parent teacher meetings.  Centre owner, Sharon goes the extra mile for the kids and parents. She has shown us kindness and understanding. Will definitely recommend this school!, We've been sending our child here since he was 4 months, and he has attended both infant care and been promoted to Toddler Class as well.  He's well taken care of with prompt updates  and photos through the school app. We enjoy seeing the photos and updates from the teachers.  Kudos to Ms Sharon for going above and beyond by even driving the school bus and ensuring the kids have a great experience! We truly appreciate the personal touch that this school offers!, It‚Äôs a good school with very warm and caring teachers. The school itself is kept clean with regular disinfection on the premises. My daughter enjoyed her time here as she liked all the teachers very much. The teachers are considerate and are open to receiving feedback to reasonably adjust to child‚Äôs needs so they are as comfortable in the environment as possible. My daughter also enjoyed and remembered a lot of her lessons as she had found them memorable. The teachers will also provide timely feedback in case there is anything noteworthy. Overall, I would recommend the school for the good nurturing environment it offers., Both my kids studied here for 1.5 years, they really looked forward to going to the school. We also noticed an all round development in our kids during their time at Cambridge. They also have school bus service for the area we stayed at, which was very convenient., I have always been keen to join the Early Childhood Industry and when I did my career change, I joined Cambridge Macpherson under their new management. I have been a teacher with Cambridge Macpherson since September 2021. My first year as a brand-new teacher have been nothing short of amazing as the management and staff have been very supportive of my journey thus far. I have thoroughly enjoyed my time here at Cambridge Macpherson and I look forward to many more years working for them. I‚Äôm ever grateful to them for giving me the chance to fulfil a dream of mine. To address the concerns raised by Ms Eileen Chew and Mr Willie Tay, I understand the frustrations and dissatisfactions you faced during your daughter‚Äôs time in Cambridge. I would like to sincerely apologize on the behalf of the teachers that cared for your daughter and the management for not acknowledging truly the distress you went through. We are sorry you had an unpleasant experience with Cambridge Macpherson. We have tried our best to mitigate the dreadful experiences and we took extra measures that the incidences did not repeat itself and we are sorry it still fell short of your expectations. Your feedback have been invaluable to us to better our infant and child care services as well as provide us with the necessary opportunity to address and review our standard of care for all of the children.  Rest assured that with your feedback, it has given us the motivation to alleviate our principles. I hope for the last months that I was your daughter‚Äôs teacher and caregiver, she was well cared for and I do miss her cheeky energy dearly.  I want to take this opportunity as well to thank you for the farewell gift and I hope your daughter is thriving at her new school.  I hope to see you around again, all the best to you and your family.  To the new parents considering Cambridge Macpherson, you will be please to know that we are a dedicated team of teachers who are committed in providing the best possible care for your children. Have a tour of our facilities and have a talk with our teachers, let us pleasantly surprise you.  Thank you.  Teacher Aini, My baby had been with this school since 2mo. We recently changed to new school as we got an offer from a nearer school to our house.  It is heartening to leave this school as I truly could feel teachers' cares from few parent's events. The school update school activities and daily care quite timely (almost end of every day). It is really a difficult decision for me as I like their school activities (can see they move towards more IT stuff) and facilities (much bigger and better than new school) except the distance from my house.  A lot of parents are concerning that their children can get sick easily at IFC. Ermm... I think all IFC are more or less the same. There is no way to 100% avoidüòÖ What we're impressed by the school is their immediate action to clean and disinfect the affected area whenever cases are reported.  Other than the location drawback, the penalty of late pick up is heavier than others. But it is understandable as the school doesn't encourage parents to always pick up late and left their babies anxious at school. Sometimes, the teachers may mistakenly put on other baby's diaper but once it is addressed, they rectify it immediately.  Overall, we're quite satisfied with the school and looking forward to come back if our bb is not used to new school., No regrets choosing this infant care. Our boy has been at this centre since 3 months (he is now 9 months). All the teachers are great at communicating, and keep us updated through the app, and when we pick him up. They also provide useful tips (since most are parents themselves), regular updates of his progress, his personality, and the fun stuff he gets up to in the centre - and there appears to be lots of fun stuff. We do not know exactly what goes on of course, but the boy is healthy, enjoys the company of other kids, eats well, and is quite clearly attached to the teachers, especially Liu Laoshi. Most importantly he is a happy and curious boy., Teachers are caring and patience. Also provide timely updates on my son's wellbeing. The IFC has also implemented many fun filled activities this year to build up my son's sensory, gross and fine motor skills.Overall, am satisfied with daily basic care and development games., They are posting photos of what activities my child is doing in school and always updating us about school holidays and whatsoever as well as we are informed of what she did and how is she doing the whole day. It gives us peace of mind. Thank you Cambridge@MacPherson! The teachers are friendly and the School head as well Ms Sharon. God bless and more power!, Our son was in Cambridge infantcare from 3-18 months old and we are grateful to the caring teachers and staff that he has met along the way. We have seen him grow and develop as a happy, gentle, and intelligent boy.  Caring for babies and toddlers under 18 months old is no walk in the park, and kudos to the team at the infant bay for always doing their best for the children!  To D‚Äôs teachers past and present, thank you very much!, Just had a very pleasant school tour at the infant care and childcare about 2 weeks ago. The infant bay looks nice and spacious and feels quite inviting. The Principal shared about the transition procedure for infants to childcare and their success stories and I felt quite assured. My friend's child is also in the Toddler class and she said her child settled really fast and is now very happy going to school. My friend speaks fondly of the class teachers as well. I will be placing my baby next year when she is much older and hope she will transit to preschool smoothly! XOXO excited mum, My wife and I went for a school tour last month and was met by Ms Sharon.  She is very friendly, passionate and can relate to challenges that parents face with their young children.  Cambridge Macpherson program offers many enriching learning opportunities that encourages children's social, emotional and physical development.  The environment is very welcoming, spacious and clean. Healthy food menu is also a definite plus point.  I highly recommend this centre üëçüëç, My daughter has been in Cambridge @ Macpherson since 2021. I can see that she is enjoying her time in school because she will come back home sharing with me things she has learnt in school. Her teachers, especially Teacher Lynee and the principal, Ms Seph, were very responsive and they sent me updates and photos on a regular basis and made time to speak with me whenever I have any concerns. I personally like their theme day and even during the Covid period, they continued to conduct cookery, water play, sensory play etc in very small groups. I appreciated the school for making extra effort and not find the trouble but still allowed the children to experience these activities even with the covid restrictions. The school also takes in parents‚Äô feedback into consideration, which I felt that we have been heard and positive changes are made for the better for the children. I am happy to see that my daughter is loving her teachers and friends because the team cares for the children and believes in communication. I feel my daughter is well taken care of and supported, which allows me to focus on my work and not have to be worried about how she is getting along in school., My child just finished his time at the ifc there. He was there from 4mths to 18mths old. We experienced a change of mgmt when he was about 6mths old and we felt it was a good change. The new management has improved the teacher to infant ratio and provided more activities. Best of all are the teachers whom my child seems to really love! Their updates are detailed and prompt and they put effort into the quarterly progress report. I feel that they really care for the kids. Overall a pretty positive experience for us at the infantcare :), I do not recommend this preschool at all.  There was a change in management 1-2 months after my child started infant care and things only got worse. My child's items were frequently misplaced even after I have labelled them and other children's items also got placed into my child's bag (e.g LABELLED soiled clothes and milk bottles, breast milk bottles, socks). I continued to put up with this because I felt that the teachers were quite ok and my child seemed to enjoy school.  However, when my child turned 12 months, she suffered 4 bruises to her head within a span of less than 1 calendar month. One of the incidents was not even reported to me until I approached the school to ask about the bruise. The school claimed that this was a miscommunication and there was ZERO apologies made for this incident. I had to ask to speak to management about the frequent injuries and the school pushed the blame to my child for being fussy/difficult instead.  Some pointers for potential parents to consider: 1. The most serious of the bruises was caused by a half door banging into my child's forehead. Apparently the teachers frequently close the door behind them without looking out for infants behind. Management said they have tried to ask the teachers to correct this action to no avail. You may interpret this however you like.  2. My child was in the centre from 3m to 12m. How is it possible that during this whole time, she could not be accustomed to more than 1 or 2 teachers? Did the teachers try enough to engage her? FYI she does not have this problem in her new school and her new teachers mentioned that this could be due to being insecure.  3. 2 of the bruises were caused by her head hitting furniture/doors. It is basic for an infant care centre to be childproof right? There are clearly lapses in childproof in the centre but the management maintains that my child (and one other child at most) are the only child that injured themselves instead of admitting that they need to look into further childproofing.  4. My child was supposed to transition to older infant group for 12 - 18m (which has a lower teacher:child ratio if 1:4 instead of 1:3 in case you also did not know) but this transition was delayed due to shortage of manpower at the older infant side. My personal belief is that this also contributed to my child's injury because she was not being engaged sufficiently at the younger infant group and hence wanted to stick to her preferred teacher.  5. My child has eczema and had to wear socks (with grip sole) to protect the wound. The centre said this caused my child to fall as being barefooted has better grip. In comparison, the new school said socks are a requirement for all children. Please interpret this as you wish.  This centre has caused a lot of grief for me as I had to transfer my child out with less than 6 months to go in infant care. I regret not transferring my child out earlier. If you are unhappy with the care your child is receiving, I suggest you consider a transfer ASAP., A very warm and cheerful concert, my son in this kindergarten for a whole year, let him leave a lot of good memories, thank you for the growth of this year., Both of my kids studied here for 3 years. Overall is a nice preschool., Send your child here at your own peril - this should be a 0 star review if possible  Abysmal childcare standards  - notwithstanding the frequent loss & mix-up of personal belongings which is already a huge red flag, my child under Cambridge‚Äôs infant care had to be put through/suffer serious negligence/‚Äúabuse‚Äù where the teachers knowingly cause her to be injured on a number of occasions.  Irresponsible + lack of accountability of management/principal/teachers - shirking responsibility after being questioned regarding the frequent occurrence of my child‚Äôs bruises/injuries by callously/conveniently blaming it on the child‚Äôs ‚Äúenergy‚Äù, albeit a 12 month old.  Besides other unacceptable/questionable issues such as high teacher turnover and absenteeism  resulting in poor teacher-child ratio, the above 2 mentioned points are already a dealbreaker. A clear observation can be made from the exodus of children and teachers over the past 1 year - does not take a genius to understand why there are always vacancies at Cambridge despite the overwhelming demand in the area due to the Bidadari estate.  Lastly, highly NOT recommended unless you have no regard for your child well-being, Facilities are good. Teachers are very patient. Recommend it"
Cambridge @ Robertson,"Offers lots of fun-filled, culture-enriching and of course educational activities that my daughter enjoys. She enjoys cookery and waterplay sessions the most., Good education to learn. Children‚Äôs Chinese learning very good!, Cambridge is a school that is very welcoming has a friendly staff and has an excellent learning environment. Parents can choose from an array of classes each semester such as coding and robotics, sports class, Chinese, dance and other enrichment courses. Additionally, the instructor go above and beyond to help the development of children, completing detailed report cards and parent teacher conferences so parents always know how their child is progressing and where we can help continue development. One perk of sending our child here is the photo gallery that shares to me moments in our child‚Äôs day. This really helps me feel more connected to my child when I‚Äôm not around and seeing how they interact with others. Overall, Cambridge is a school that really cares and I am so thankful for all the time these instructors have put in to help shape our child‚Äôs future. I feel confident that our kid will be successful in their learning career thanks to this wonderful school., The staff and school are sincere and I have a very good impression of them. At first, the child with febrile convulsions was not supported, but the child was kindly given advice so that he could return to the nursery school. thank you!"

Great use of applications for communications, updates and extension of learning for Mother Tongue. Generally my boys are happy attending school so that makes us happy too. :), We couldn't be happier with our experience at Cambridge @ Sengkang. As parents, we had high expectations when searching for the perfect preschool for our child, and this wonderful establishment surpassed them all.  From the moment we walked through the doors, we were greeted with warmth and enthusiasm by the friendly staff. Their genuine love for children and dedication to providing a nurturing environment was evident from the start. The preschool's facilities are well-maintained, clean, and designed with the needs and interests of young children in mind.  What truly sets Cambridge @ Sengkang apart is the exceptional quality of education they offer. The curriculum is thoughtfully crafted to foster a love for learning while nurturing social, emotional, and cognitive development. Our child has blossomed under the guidance of the passionate and highly qualified teachers. Their patience, creativity, and ability to engage children in meaningful activities are remarkable.  The emphasis on holistic development is evident in the range of stimulating and age-appropriate activities provided. From arts and crafts to music, outdoor play, and imaginative role-playing, our child has had countless opportunities to explore, discover, and develop essential skills in a fun and engaging way. The preschool also promotes inclusivity and celebrates diversity, fostering a sense of acceptance and respect among the young learners.  Communication between the preschool and parents is outstanding. We receive regular updates on our child's progress, including detailed reports and informative parent-teacher meetings. The teachers and staff are always available to address any concerns or answer questions promptly, making us feel supported and involved in our child's educational journey.  Safety is a top priority at  this school. We appreciate the strict security measures implemented to ensure the well-being of every child. The premises are secure, and protocols are in place to monitor access and maintain a safe environment for everyone.  Finally, we would be remiss not to mention the warm and inclusive community that Cambridge @ Sengkang has fostered. The preschool organizes various events and family engagement activities throughout the year, bringing parents, teachers, and children together to create lasting memories and meaningful connections.  In conclusion, we wholeheartedly recommend Cambridge @ Sengkang to any parent seeking a nurturing and enriching preschool experience for their child. The dedicated staff (especially good leadership, Ms Siti), excellent curriculum, safe environment, and strong sense of community make it a standout choice. We are grateful for the positive impact it has had on our child's early education and development.  Thank you Cambridge @ Sengkang for providing an exceptional preschool experience that has laid a solid foundation for our child's lifelong love of learning!, My son started at N1. He has improved so much ever since he started school. As he is a December baby I was worried if he will be left behind, but the teachers assured me. I can see vast improvements in his speech, vocabulary and motor skills. The school has excursions as well and as a parent I believe learning beyond classroom is important. Highly recommend to all parents!, My child is in playgroup and transitioning him to this school is the best decision that i‚Äôve made. The toddler teachers have been very patient with him, and they‚Äôve put in alot of effort to help him adjust and feel comfortable. I can also sense the genuine care and concern that they have for my son. Kudos to Teacher Mus and Pan Lao Shi! While the physical space is small, i like that it is cozy and that my child gets acquainted with the older children in school as well., I highly recommend Cambridge SengKang for their caring staff and the emphasis of whole-child education, not just on academics but also on social and emotional skills.  The team of teachers in the school are dedicated, and nurturing. They know each child in the school by name even though they may not be teaching. You can see that they care. They are family. I appreciate the close communication with the school, as I believe the partnership between parents and school play a critical role in developing and caring for my children. There are weekly updates, photos to keep me informed and that helps me in conversing with them at home.  Special mention to the teachers for arranging plenty of opportunities for them to learn playfully (eg. field trips, celebration activities). My children learn best through first-hand experiences and play.  A big thank you to all staff at Cambridge SengKang for providing a safe, healthy and fun environment for my children to grow up in., I really love this school, my son was studying in this school since N1, the teachers are all very professional with the passion for teaching!

Happy that we made the decison 3 years ago to enroll the kids  to Cambridge.Highly recommend it to all parents who are looking for a good preschool for your children., Teachers and principal not welcoming to parents. They don‚Äôt actually follow the curriculum/timetable as advertised. Don‚Äôt fall for the fancy marketing. Just basic childcare. Children don‚Äôt actually get to play or run around much, confined to the tiny classroom., My son has been in cambridge @ sengkang since he was in N2. He wasn't very keen on going to a full day childcare initially but thanks to Ms Siti and Yin Lao Shi for their care and patience, he was able to settle in well after a while. Special thanks to Teacher Lei, Teacher Nora and Yin Lao Shi who guided him during his kindergarten days which allow him to have a smooth transition to primary school., My daughter has been at the Centre since 2017. The teachers and staffs have been very compassionate and helpful. I am happy with the progress that my daughter has accomplished., The teachers are prompt to response and helpful to accommodate some requests. My child enjoys going to school., Located at 50 Sengkang East Way.It is at the corner of a row of private houses.It is a good preschool for young children.The preschool children consist of local residents and foreigners as well.  Dated :  12/07/ 2018 ( Thursday )., wow, Highly recommended, Small school with very dedicated teachers and principal. Communications with school is prompt and updates are always provided promptly to inform parents on the curriculum of the school. My kid simply loves the school!"
Cambridge @ Serangoon Gardens Pte Ltd,"My child has attended this pre school for the last 2 years. The first year was relatively okay given the caring and attentiveness of the teachers. However as he progressed to the next grade,  the turnover of the teachers became very high and there were several incidents of favoritism and unprofessional behavior of the teachers towards students. What is more intolerable is the unprofessional attitude of the principal, whose defensive nature often brushes away the concerns of the parents. What is more appalling is the business-minded attitude of this principal who did not even bother to acknowledge us when we decided to withdraw our child. That 180 degree change in attitude tells us that this is a pre school whose philosophy is based on one single thing and that is money. Our child is fortunate to make many good friends who have eventually decided to leave this school as well. One can only hope that with the new principal will infuse strong ethical principles worthy of a professional educator.  Update: In a desperate bid to retain the students, the school has dished out rebates/discounts to the remaining students in an inconsistent manner that is not transparent. Again, this has proven that the school is only focused on monetary value and not on professional or educational enhancements for the children. We are glad our child has finally left this school., Our son have had great time at school. Before Cambridge, he was struggling in another preschool with loads of homework and strict teachers. Cambridge brought joy back to his study with innovative curriculums and great teachers. We are very happy with our decision to move our son here.  Free swimming class is a plus. Serangoon Gardens ountry club members can get good discount on the tuition fees.  We wholeheartedly recommend the school to any parents who what their kids to have a great and enjoyable preschool education., My girl has graduated from Cambridge SG branch last year and was previously under the care of Teacher Edzel, Èõ∑ËÄÅÂ∏à, Teacher Joyce, È©¨ËÄÅÂ∏à throughout her journey. She enjoyed learning and enjoyed school. The teachers constantly provided updates of her learning journey, which included videos and photos. The teachers were also in constant contact with us as parents. We received timely feedback on what she did well and areas she could improve on. She has now transited to primary 1 and is adapting very well which I believe is due to wholesome curriculum (iSTEAM, English and Chinese literacy programs). Thank you very much teachers for taking such a good care of my child, especially Teacher Edzel and Èõ∑ËÄÅÂ∏à. Your dedication, hard work and commitment to my child‚Äôs learning journey is highly commendable. Also a special thanks to Principal Irene for being such a a welcoming and understanding principal. It has been a pleasure working with you. Thank you!, My child recently enrolled in Cambridge @ SGCC at K1 level and so far we have been incredibly pleased with the learning programme and teachers.  The curriculum focuses on iSteam topics that are activities are project based with lots of inquiry and experimentation. This has proven to be of great interest to my 5year old and positively influenced his attitude towards school & learning. We can see the active engagement he has with learning through enthusiasm of sharing on knowledge tidbits he has gained in school.  A big thank you to Teacher Joyce and Lei Laoshi who are his teachers in K1. The amount of effort that goes into designing and executing their lessons is very commendable. As well the the time taken to provide individual update to parents on our child‚Äôs progress regularly., Here‚Äôs sharing my heartiest thanks and gratitude to Cambridge @ Serangoon Gardens from the heart of an aunt!  My niece and nephew are students at this school, and my family would like to sincerely and ardently thank the teachers and Principal Irene for their genuine love and meticulous care for each of their students!  I remember when my niece first started swimming lessons in K1 last year, she was very scared of the water and didn‚Äôt want to go for the swimming classes. Qiu Yi Lao Shi encouraged her not to be scared and scaffolded her, sitting beside her near the swimming pool first to encourage her to get familiar with the environment while her classmates had their swimming lessons. The next time, Qiu Yi Lao Shi encouraged my niece to dip her feet in the waters.  Slowly but surely, my niece gained courage and joined in subsequent swimming lessons. She‚Äôs now a little radiant and enthusiastic swimmer and guess what her favourite subject in school is? It is SWIMMING! Thank you Qiu Yi Lao Shi for believing in her and seeing potential in her!  Qiu Yi Lao Shi is also now the teacher of my younger nephew in N1 this year. I admire and thank her, Teacher Ran and Lu Lao Shi for taking care of him and the young students so, so, so well! They are extremely attentive to their students‚Äô needs, give us advice and tips, and have enormous amounts and oodles of stamina in taking care of the students everyday. Wow. I have much to learn from them!  I highly recommend this amazing school!, Cara joined Cambridge Serangoon Gardens only in K2 and I was afraid that she would have problems adapting to the new school, new teachers and new curriculum. But she had very minimum issues thanks to the patience and care of her teachers - shout out to Teacher Edzel and Lei Laoshi - who were attentive to Cara when she just joined. She started enjoying her classes very quickly and was really sad to graduate.  Thanks very much Cambridge Serangoon Gardens (also to Principal Irene and the other Teachers) ! I know Cara‚Äôs brother is is good hands :), Both my girls attended Cambridge for their entire pre school years. While there were some teacher (including principal) transitions due to staff turnover in the initial years, the staff strength has more or less stabilised. There are a few great teachers around who have provided my girls strong foundation in their pre school years and always encouraging and giving my girls a chance to grow and learn. Special mention to Ma Laoshi who has shown great patience to my younger girl who was especially clingy when she just started school. She was also very encouraging when there was a year end concert and my girl was nervous and needed assurance. Also grateful to teacher Joyce, teacher Edzel and Bian laoshi for imparting valuable knowledge and building a strong foundation for their primary school. They have shown love and patience to my girls and provided a nurturing environment for them to grow and be confident. Also, thanks to principal Irene for providing great leadership in the school as I can see things have stabilised quite alot since she took over the helm a few years back. Thanks to Cambridge Sgoon Garden!, We want to thank Cambridge Preschool for providing a safe environment for my girl (H.chia) to grow. We love their awesome I-steam curriculum, daily fun activities, good chinese learning programmes and great attentiveness from the team. They have helped to positively enrich and broaden my girl‚Äôs knowledge and boosting her confidence to share information with others. As she graduates this year, I want to pen down my gratefulness and appreciation to all teachers who have taught her throughout her journey here at Cambridge (ms Edzel, lei laoshi, ma laoshi, ms Joyce, qiuyu laoshi + enrichment tchers), the principal, Ms Irene for her leadership and the staff team who were involved to care for her in school!  Just want to say the best moments for us, was watching her perform and enjoy herself on stage during the graduation concert, it really made us extremely happy and proud of what she has become today! Big thank you to her k2 teachers, ms Edzel and lei laoshi for the year-long care and guidance!  Highly recommend Cambridge Preschool @ Serangoon gardens :), I am a mom of two boys. I had transferred my elder one to Cambridge when he was N2. Before Cambridge, I sent him to MindChamps, but he really didn't enjoy school there, and the school seemed to be more academic focused, and the teachers we met were not so good. besides, the teacher turnover rate there was so high, which we thought were not good for the younger kids.  I have read the reviews here about Cambridge Serangoon, agree that there are areas that the school can improve, but in the end, what's the most important to me is whether my kids like going to school and like the teachers. Every school has good and not so good teachers, so we just need to make sure whether our kids like going school. Here, I also want to give my thanks to Teacher Joyce,  Qiuyu laoshi, Teacher Edzel, Lei Laoshi, Bian Laoshi and also Teacher Aileen, thanks all for taking care of my kids and helping them learn and grow during the first few years., My daughter Kate , looks forward to going school everyday! Teacher Edzel and Èõ∑ËÄÅÂ∏à lovingly takes care of her welfare in school.  It always a fun and adventurous day EVERDAY, as they go through isteam activities to learn and explore new things. ‚ù§Ô∏èü•≥ü§©üòçüíØ. Even the food is so super yummy ( in-house cook) that she takes double helping! Kudos and great job to Ms Irene and all other teachers in creating a safe environment and pushing our kids to excel!, Cambridge Preschool at Serangoon Gardens is a pre-school that offers holistic learning through its curriculum. Young learners benefit from the various programs such as speech and drama, music, soccer training, swimming and even coding for young minds. The principal, teachers and staff are committed in ensuring the total package when it comes to equipping young learners with the right skills before they enter primary school. Check them out!, The teachers are very caring and patient in helping my son settle in toddler class when he first started school, that's one thing that i am very thankful for. He has been very happy since then and i noticed he is a lot more vocal, especially in sharing with us what he learnt in school. Seems like the school is providing him with a good environment to develop! The teachers also give regular feedback about his behaviour in school. Thank you to the teachers and the principal for all that you have done. Do continue to inspire the little ones!, Very happy with the school so far. My child learns a lot from the school curriculum and enjoys going to school. They have caring teachers and staff who address all children by name even if they do not teach the child. I am especially impressed with how the teachers planned activities and created materials to engage the children (and family) during the Circuit Breaker HBL period, ensuring that the children continue learning and remain familiar with their classmates even when apart and helping to ease them back to school in June. Thank you for the hard work in nurturing the children!, Teachers go the extra mile and genuinely care for their students' wellbeing.  Each child is treated like a true individual, encouraged to leverage on their strengths and develop to their full potential.  Most importantly, my kids are happy to go to school!, I actually visited close to 10 pre-school before deciding on Cambridge. The knowledge and values that my son has acquired the past 1 year definitely affirmed my choice. To me the most important factor are the staff in the school. I would say that from the Principal to the  Teacher and to even the cleaning aunty, they are genuine and show care and concern from the bottom of their heart. Thanks once again and keep up the fantastic work!, Generally speaking, Cambridge @ Serangoon Gardens is not the best place to groom your child. The programs in place did not seem to differ much from other pre-schools, however, they charge much higher premium. The teachers are not known for accepting feedback andtend to have a huge ego accompanied by poor EQ. Unless you are willing to turn a blind eye and pay a higher premium due to conveniences, I do not recommend this pre-school for your child..., Since first case of Hand Foot Mouth disease (HFM) on 1st July 2022 until now 15th July 2022 explode to 17 case HFM (from Nursery 2 -> to N1 -> to Toddlers class) now still saying in the announcement that: ‚ÄúPlease be assured that we are taking all precautionary measures in accordance to our SOP to prevent any further outbreak‚Äù Working way and arrangements are completely wrong. So disappointed!, A school led by a principal with little integrity and teachers with poor communication and great defensive skills.  My child attended school for almost a year. Prior to attending school, she had never developed diaper rash before. Diaper rash was a recurring issue since the beginning of school. I had to take leave initially to nurse her skin back. Only to have her develop diaper rash again when she returned back to school. We tried very hard each time to nurse her skin back over the weekend, only to have the diaper rash recur again on a Monday.  The teachers were mostly defensive and pushed the blame to extrinsic factors like wrong diaper brand, wrong wet wipe, wrong cream. FYI, there were the very same ones we had been using since she was born.  It improved for 3 months somewhere down the road after we made a big fuss about it when it got to a point where her rash was so bad. We got her seen by a Dermatologist who identified the cause as poor hygiene due to infrequent diaper change. From then on, she develops diaper rash every now and then and her skin will be all good for 1-2months after each time we make a complaint.  The last straw was when she developed diaper rash again after promoting to N1. Being under a new team of teachers, we do understand that it takes awhile for them to grasp the care of each individual child. However, the response that ticked me off was from Teacher Sha where she quoted that they have already been changing it very promptly and frequently for my child. Even more regularly compared to other children in the same class. She gave me an ultimatum, it is either we No. 1 change doctor, no. 2 change diaper brand or no. 3 change the diaper cream we're using. I went for option 4, change school.  Had the teachers be alittle more empathetic and apologetic and less defensive in their tone, we probably would have stayed on.  Then came the last issue just before we completed the last month notice in the school, where the school FAILED to notify us of the HFMD cases even though my child was technically still a student there. In my conversation with Principal Irene over the phone to clarify this matter, she even lied about the timing the communication app was disabled, stating that it was only late evening when in fact ECDA wrote back stating it was at noon. (Refer to photos for email records of me writing in to ECDA and Cambridge Head Office). No sense of social responsibility at all, they simply don't care since child will not be returning to their school anyway.  Aside to all these, some other minor issues are like very little update and upload of photos. Their teacher to student ratio is also not as good as what was marketed during the pre-enrolment phase.  We have only met ONE good teacher in our journey with Cambridge, Teacher Denise. She demonstrated that she genuinely cared for the children and has excellent communication skills when it comes to reassuring us parents. It was a pity to have her leave the school. I guess there is a reason why good teachers choose to leave.  Overall, I find no sense in paying a premium for a school of this quality. There is a reason why there is always a vacancy in this school when everything else in the vicinity is full.  My apologies for the lengthy post., They will forcefully take your child from you during the separation process and this instills fear in the child's mind. Strongly do not recommend. The principal is also just all business and does not sincerely care. Extremely bad experience, Nice preschool with patient and passionate teachers. Kids enjoy their school life and learn a lot here."
Camelot River Valley,"Camelot provides an excellent, caring, warm and engaging environment for all infant/ toddler and children. The only reason I could start work within 3 months of my delivery is because we found them. My daughter has been going to Camelot Rivervalley since she was 5 months and she loves it. Hani Miss has been our saviour and our child‚Äôs favourite. She is very warm and passionately takes care of every child‚Äôs needs. I have recommended many of my friends to their pre-school and everyone had a pleasant experience. Thanks to Mel, for keeping the standard of care and education so high for the infants/ children., Mel and her team of teachers at Camelot were very patient and nurturing towards our son . The school offered very interesting activities both indoors and outdoors . Communication flow with the teachers was also great so we received regular updates on our child‚Äôs progress at school., The best gift we could have ever made to our daughter. This little school is a rare gem and we hope to recommend it to more and more friends. Our Nina literally grew up here, like in a second family. Never a cry before going to school and I‚Äôm sure it‚Äôs because of the smiley staff and teachers, the variety of activities , the engagement provided , the enthusiasm and the passion of who is leading the school. We found definitely more than what we were looking for. Differently from all the other schools nearby, I found that Camelot really focuses on the quality rather than the number of kids to enroll. We literally left a piece of heart there and we will be always grateful for the great job these teachers have done and will keep doing. ‚ô•Ô∏è, Our daughter Joined Camelot school in January 2022 and studied here for a year. Camelot school was like her second home! She enjoyed learning activities and attending the school a lot. There was never a day she wanted to skip the school. This speaks highly of the love, care, and learning she received at the school. Special thanks to all her teachers especially teacher Lyanna and principal Mel. We highly recommend it to other parents., Camelot is a wonderful school for children heading to international elementary schools.  Mel and the teachers are professional, caring and patient.  They did not hesitate to give our kids additional learning time to catch up while making learning enjoyable.  We also had some unusual circumstances which Mel and her team did their best to accommodate., We highly recommend this school! Our 3 years old son stay in Camelot every morning during 6 months and he was very happy. We saw him making progress every day. The teachers are very kind and they propose lots of different activities for the kids! We also appreciated the flexibility of this school and the pictures shared through the app by the teachers. Thanks again for everything. Eva & David, Mel & the Teachers at Camelot take great care of our son. He enjoys his time at school and we noticed his development advance as well.  Highlights are arts and crafts, playtime outside, reading, singing and events around culture. Camelot is safe, fun and educational. Thank you to the kind staff for your flexibility and answering my many questions. We appreciated the updates on his time at school with photos shared through the app by the teachers. Our son bonded with the the Teachers as they truly care about their students. Very much appreciate all the effort behind taking care of our little one., My 16 month old has been attending Camelot for 2 months and has been very happy there. Her teachers are caring and responsive when needs be as is the school Principal Mel. Very happy with the school and the updates provided. I love the activities they do- sensory, water play, crafts, reading, song & dance and outdoor play in the playground. Cannot think of a negative thing to say!, Our twins enjoyed the school activities a lot. We have seen great improvement in them. All the staff are very friendly and easily accommodates our concern and request. Communication is very easy and hassle free especially for working parents like us. We  also can easily see the progress of our child on a day to day basis. We highly recommend Camelot., We highly recommend Camelot. Mel and the teachers are amazing, patient and loving. They always come up with great activities, both educational and creative. It‚Äôs a small preschool and communication is easy. Our son loves it and enjoys every single day with his friends and teachers at Camelot., A terrific daycare centre! The teachers are lovely and so caring - impressive that they know literally every single kid by name! We haad a great experience here, the only reason we left is because of the distance from the apartment we moved to. I need to also mention Mel who is the most dedicated principal ive ever met. No question or issue was ever too difficult for Mel. A lovely person all round and an asset to Camelot!, Mel and the team provided wonderful day care for two months for our 15 month old son, Arthur. They were amazingly flexible and also provided regular (and super entertaining) updates through the Class Dojo application. Arthur seemed to have a great time and we were super impressed with every aspect of Camelot! Highly recommend!, Highly recommend this school! Our 22 month old boy went to their playgroup and it was amazing to see how quickly he adapted. From tears the first days to a simple 'bye mommy' and running happy towards his 'friends!'. We saw him making progress every day. The teachers are very professional and communication was great. And lots of different activities for the kids! We had to change schools because we moved to East Coast. Otherwise we would have definitely stayed here, great school!, I am just ecstatic, satisfied and feeling accomplished that I found a gem! I  am glad I found this school for my son. The teachers are friendly, knowledgeable, professional, caring and more importantly patient. I am impressed too on how much they also go the extra mile. They ensure cleanliness and put priority in everyone's health, they ensure to sanitize and clean every day apart from the scheduled clean ups. I really truly admire the teachers in Camelot. They uphold true value and integrity. My son loves going to school. I don't have difficulties waking him up in the morning. As soon as I tell him he is going to school he immediately and hastily runs to the toilet to shower and prepare.  We always have this debate every Friday night as to why he does not have to go to school on Saturdays and Sundays, clearly he is enjoying his time at school which I am pleased. He has learned a lot too and saw improvement in his focus and listening skills. Parents, enroll your kids here, the head teacher Teacher Mel is hands on and ensures everyone is well taken care of., Mel and the teachers have done a great job in offering a good quality place for toddlers.  We were there for 3 months and they were very flexible and answer all my questions despite our unique circumstances while offering a high level of learning.  Thank you again and my daughter misses your school!, Mel and the teachers are amazing. They give wonderful care and have amazing activities. I can‚Äôt speak highly enough of The Camelot. We are very lucky to cross paths with it., My son started his learning journey with this school and I must say that this Preschool is an amazing place!!! Very clean with great staff and very welcoming. The teachers really take an effort to engage the kids and develop them in an individualised way. The management is committed to providing a safe , fun and loving environment and we're thankful to them. Happy kid, Happy parent!!!, Never did I expect my very shy 2.5yo girl (thanks to the covid lockdown we couldn't get her to socialize with other kids much) could adapt so well at school just after the first week, and she always looked forward to going back to school!  After attending school for just about 2 months, my girl has become way more sociable. She had fun and learned plenty of stuff, too.  I like that the teachers are genuinely kind and loving. Mel, the headmaster, who has experience living both locally and abroad, understood my need very well as a ""parent-in-transit"" (we were new parents in Singapore and had to move to another country within short notice). She had been really accommodating and provided me with good advice.  Another thing I like about Camelot is that it's located right opposite of Great World City Shopping Centre, super convenient to do some work at a cafe, do grocery shopping or go for a massage at off peak hours.  I would give the school a five star rating if they could offer whole food plant based meals to the kids :)  Highly recommend., Mel and the team are absolutely wonderful. It has small classes and they do very creative activities with the young children. We sent our son at 15 mo and he LOVES it, My daugter had a great time growing up at the school. Administration team was so fast and efficient, and teachers alwasy provide great creative classes. Thank you so much !, The staff are so welcoming, loving and very reassuring. Great activities are done like cooking and the small environment is really nurturing, We are really happy with Camelots, they are doing a great job. :), Nice kindergarten, my daughter likes her teachers, The teachers at Camelot are very friendly, thoughtful, kind, and unbelievably patient! It was my son's first school and he had some difficulty with separation but the teachers are always calming and caring, makes sure every child feels well taken care of. They have fun, messy activities throughout the week and my son is definitely experiencing things he wouldn't have been able to at home. I enjoy seeing photos from his day through the school app. I can easily imagine he is learning and expanding his world tremendously through his experience at Camelot. So grateful he got to be a part of this school.  I chose this school for my son's first nursery school. From the first time I contacted them, we were able to communicate quickly, and from the tour to admission, the decision was made in about a week. When we visited, my son was engrossed in playing, and the teachers' efforts made me feel at ease, so I made the decision immediately. I am very grateful that you kindly and patiently accepted my son, who couldn't stop crying after being separated from his mother for the first time. They've designed their daily activities to be fun and enjoyable, and I'm looking forward to seeing how the day goes through the app."

Carpe Diem @ 78 Yio Chu Kang,"Both my boys attended the preschool for about 3 years. The Teachers and Principal is nice and caring. One of my boy required occupational support from a special needs school and the teachers have to visit the school once a week to shadow my boy in the preschool. The teachers and principal here is very supportive and accommodating especially Teacher Ching. She always make an effort to teach my boy does thing independently and she would pay extra attention on him when she conduct lesson., Both of my children attend Carpe Diem @ Stradia. My eldest graduated last year; he joined in 2021 and started his Kindergarten at Carpe Diem. The teachers made the transition very smooth for him, and he enjoyed school mostly because of the teachers and his friends. My youngest started at Carpe Diem when she was 3 months old. I never had a big issue with her well-being in school, as she enjoys it. She's now starting her nursery at Carpe Diem. Besides the caring teachers, the center is very clean and provides a nice learning environment., Though my daughter‚Äôs stay at the infant care was a short 2 months, the overall experience was very positive.  1. Healthy teachers to infant ratio 2. Teachers were attentive to my daughter‚Äôs need. 3. The daily schedule and updates were prompt and well presented via an app.  If not for the long distance I would have continue to remain with the Centre.  I shifted to another branch nearer to my house., Both my kids have attended Carpe Diem @ Stradia since infant care. They have been showered with abundance of care and love by all the teachers and caregivers day in day out. They have also been nurtured and groomed into happy, well-mannered and free-spirited children. It is never an issue sending them to school everyday and picking them up in high spirits. Huge kudos to every staff and member at Carpe Diem for taking such good care of our kids, constantly hearing parents' feedbacks and improving the environment all for the good of our kids and providing us parents with great ease. Well done Carpe Diem @ Stradia!, All three of my kids attended Carpe Diem @ Stradia and I have seen so much progression with regards to their communication skills, attitudes and also personal skills. The teachers are very kind and motivating and I really value the commitment they have to ensure our children are enriched with values and interpersonal skills. Thank you so much Carpe Diem @ Stradia!, My son has been attending carpe diem from infant care till K2. Lots of fond memories of teachers and friends. Everyone is warm and nurturing ., Nice, Clean and Cozy place for your little ones. Patient, helpful and very caring teachers and principal. My kid enjoyed 6 years here."
Carpe Diem @ Anchorvale,
Carpe Diem @ Bukit Batok Central,"This school is not good. I have heard the teachers scolded my child before such as‚ÄùI say stop crying right! STOP!‚Äù Or ‚ÄúI say stop ah‚Äù and also they only update the photos every 6 months! While schools like sparkle tots update weekly. I didn‚Äôt know better then.. my child didn‚Äôt like to go school and always cry before entering. Now he enjoys school at sparkle tots after we made the switch. In addition the homework they expect parents to print out physical photos while at sparkle tots we can simply upload on to the app. I hope parents can be more aware of the ‚Äúnorm‚Äù where schools are diligent in providing updates and managing homework. Please reflect on your management. (some teachers are nice though) but I am not sure.., The teachers are great with the students., Great place with dedicated teachers!"
Carpe Diem @ Fajar Road,"Our kids had a wonderful time during their journey in carpe diem young joy.  Tevie joined the school since N1(2020). We appreciate that the teachers assist Tevie in toilet train, stop milk bottle feeding and be more independent in many more aspects.  Subsequently, even our 2nd child, Ellie also joined the school since PG(2022).  We really appreciate Teacher Jenny the way she handle kids. As she is firm and approachable by kids. During the 2H year of Tevie K2, he have some behaviour issue and Teacher Jenny uses different methods to help Tevie during his melt down in school.  Dong Laoshi also teaches both Tevie and Ellie. She is a firm teacher yet handle all children differently. She knows how to manage both our children differently as she truly understands that all child are different.  Lastly, Tevie transit to Primary 1 and Ellie transfer to another Carpe diam. We feel that carpe diam curriculum is great whereby it really also prepare Tevie for primary 1 by giving spelling and Âê¨ÂÜô„ÄÇ"
Carpe Diem @ Hilltop Pte Ltd,"First visited the school in 2020, I loved the outdoor environment so much and I know my kids will love it. Registered both from PG onwards and I would say all the teachers here are so passionate about children. They not only groom them academically but also organized a lot of hands on activities. I can  see great improvements in my children., My son has been under their care for 1 and half year and I am so grateful that the teachers are so caring, close to your child personally and when I saw this, I feel so touched.  My son was a firstborn, quiet and closed boy. We rarely speak Chinese at home as well. Now he is so talkative and his Chinese is good ‚ò∫Ô∏è  They updated me for important occasions, so many activities for parents child bonding and I always feel at ease with the teachers. Thank you so much teachers!!, Wonderful experience for my child and I. The teachers are experienced, dedicated and they put in a lot of effort to ensure that the students are well-taken care of.Not forgetting this place is lovely, bicycle corners, big playground and huge spacious ground.My child loves his time here and it has been an amazing journey with this schook. Miss Joyce and Shin Ru are extremely helpful towards us üòÄ I will miss my time with this school too ‚ù§Ô∏è, Both kids have been attending since PG. Great campus with lots of greenery. Principal and teachers have also been really active with updates throughout the years. Met numerous thoughtful and great teachers., 2 of my kids attended this lovely preschool and they never stop talking about it even when they graduated. the teachers are always so encouraging and patient towards my younger one as he tend to be a introvert. Environment is such a fantastic place to be. Dont think you can find another private cc to such a rustic setting.  Their school events are really very special. My eldest had the opportunity to go for a K2 overnight camp at the now defunct Underwater world and it was really memorable for him back then. Then came didi's turn, the school actually organize a 2D1N camp, had a hike to MacRitchie then back in school, teachers set up a campfire with firewood and  the dinner gathering with the whole K2 groups of parents. This is how much and how far the teachers will go. They forsake their own rest and go all out for the kids and tell us ""its ok. as long as the kids have fun."" Thank you Carpe Diem @ Hilltop for giving my kids a very special childhood., The school has a huge campus in a rustic ""kampung"" setting. Vastly different from the usual ""container-like"" preschools out there.  Both my daughters are currently attending school here for a couple of months now, and they love going to school! The teachers are so loving and they really go out of their way to make learning fun and interesting for even the youngest kids!  Special thanks to Teacher Ji, Lai laoshi, Teacher Fay, Weiwei laoshi, Peiqi laoshi, Teacher Del, Teacher Kieran, Lin Laoshi and so many more who make school such an enjoyable experience for both my girls!, A rare preschool with a huge compound of its own and mesmerising greenery. Effective and caring teachers. Kids are well prepared for primary school. Teachers are approachable and friendly, always keep parents well-informed of children‚Äôs progress in school. Parent-child bonding activities are very enjoyable., Wonderful experience for a child and parent. Lovely environment for learning, fun, memories and many more. I can't remember my childcare days but through my kid's, I had a wonderful time, Really love the compound and outdoor play time they have. My lo would play in the playground while waiting for me to pick up. His chinese teacher, who had left the school, was really good.  But too bad, he didnt like the teachers in his new class. And started to have a phobia of going school.  Wonder why they didnt request to add a pavement from main road to gate. Pretty dangerous for both drivers and pedestrians. At least, put drain covers., Principal is unprofessional."

Carpe Diem @ Parkway Centre Pte Ltd,"I'm delighted to express my satisfaction with Carpe Diem, Marine Parade childcare centre. The teachers stand out for their knowledge, care, and attentiveness, creating a nurturing environment for the children. The K2 curriculum's depth surprised me; it occasionally mirrors my daughter's Primary 3 education, ensuring a strong educational foundation.  I feel confident that my child is well-prepared for Primary 1, thanks to the comprehensive teaching approach. The frequent excursions and engaging activities provide a well-rounded experience. The Carpe Diem app adds convenience to communication and updates.  A notable highlight is that one of the Chinese teachers has been with the centre for many years. Her long-standing commitment brings years of invaluable experience to the centre. Additionally, the Principal, Shannon, impresses with her well-rounded education and leadership. In summary, my experience has been overwhelmingly positive at this childcare centre., We started my baby at 6M for infant care. At the start she fell sick (usual) but once she settled in, she had lots of fun in school. She learn how to climb in school, how to get down from height. The teachers were very attentive and kind. She had lots of sensory play activities and bring back her art activities. and I find their curriculum very interactive. If not for my change in residential place, I would have continued her in the school. One good thing is they really made the timetable work. My baby had no issue following the timetable although she changed school too. Thanks to carpe diem marine parade. We really loved the school and their teachers., Zander's two-year journey at Carpe Diem MP has been delightful and enriching. Each day, he eagerly shared the joy and knowledge gained at school. I'm grateful for the caring teachers, especially Teacher Feeqa and ÈôàËÄÅÂ∏à, and the cheerful morning check-ins by Êù®ËÄÅÂ∏à. Special appreciation to the teachers and Ms. Shannon (Centre manager) for organizing memorable events like the Fathers' Day celebration at Marine Parade and the 2023 school graduation. Being part of the Carpe Diem MP family has been a pleasure. Thank you, teachers, and Ms. Shannon. Looking forward to our next meeting. HAPPY NEW YEAR!, My daughter was there for 3 years (PG-N2). We put her in another school because we moved house. With good curriculum, combined with great care from teachers, helps my child to grow. Special shoutout for Tr.Feeqa for being so patient and loving towards my child. Thank you Carpe Diem MP!!, My girl started K2 in Carpe Diem in July after a terrible time with a nearby preschool that charges more than $1000 monthly. My girl just graduated from Carpe Diem.

Carpe Diem Springs Preschool,"We never regret on choosing this centre for our daughter who is in N2. It was her first time going to a school and the school has make her adjustment easy.. They will always keep you updated and very attentive on our daughter on her needs.. We see our daughter learned and grew a lot from this centre.. Their director Jervis is very hands-on to the kids and very flexible to parents matter.. The teachers are very nice and approachable as well.. Highly recommendedüëçüëçüëç, Our son Di Hao had a marvelous time at Carpe Diem Springs Preschool. We visited several other schools before but were immediately convinced that Carpe Diem Springs was the right choice for us because of the relaxed atmosphere and the warm and cheerful teachers. Children have loads of fun while learning and the teachers truly have attention for more than only cognitive learning. They also learn important life skills such as creativity and healthy living. Kids are respected and encouraged in a positive and loving way. Their independence is trained which boosts their confidence. If you want your child to have a balanced, joyful and multi-faceted early learning experience, Carpe Diem Springs Preschool is a great option., Put my 2 children in Carpe Diem Springs since 2017. The teachers are caring and work closely with parents on the holistic well-being of the child. Curriculum wise, I love the 8 multiple intelligences concept and the teachers taught my children many things while adhering to this concept. The school also helps to prepare the k2 students for p1 so that the transition for the kids is as smooth as possible. Never regretted or looked back on my decision. Thank you teachers and staff of Carpe Diem Springs!, Both my kids are enrolled in this preschool, teachers and principal are patient and helpful. Kids adapt to new environment very fast less than 1 month. Preschool make effort for frequent outdoor excursion, kids enjoy it alot!! Thank you Carpe diem springs!!, We used to stay in the area so that‚Äôs why our older daughter was enrolled in Carpe Diem Springs. After moving, we pulled her out to attend a school near our current place during my maternity leave for 2nd child, however, there was a stark difference in her feedback when she came home everyday. Hence, she went right back to Carpe Diem Springs 4-5 months after and now her brother attends there too‚Ä¶.despite the distance we have to travel everyday. That‚Äôs a testament in itself to how much the children likes the school and how we‚Äôre assured as parents the good education and wonderful care they get here. Highly recommended school!!, Carpe Diem Springs has been a wonderful, positive place for my 3 kids to thrive in. Ms Jervis, all the teachers and staff always have a smile on their face and are so welcoming. Thank you for always trying to find new ways to educate and keep the kids engaged. Highly recommended!, I sent my two kids to this centre. The staff and teachers are very caring and dedicated. They provide timely updates as well as detailed holistic reports about my children's learning. I feel they are well prepared in terms of literacy and numeracy skill for their age group. The school also has group work, projects and many learning journeys for the children to make learning fun and interesting. Most importantly, I happy that the teachers impact and instill good values and competencies in my children., The teachers always gave us timely updates and feedback on our kids. The teachers understand our kids so well that they could give us clear and concrete advice to improve both their soft and hard skills which is crucial for our kid‚Äôs development.  The yearly reviews were also very professionally presented. I would like to take this opportunity to thank Ms Jervis and her team of dedicated and caring teachers for giving our 3 kids a fun and memorable preschool experience. Carpe Diem, Carpe Diem, Carpe Diem!, Nice teachers, warm cosy environment. Was recommended by my friend whose girl is in N2 now.

Appreciate Ms Jervis for her patience & leadership in the centre., My son has been with Carpe Diem Spring since 18 months old. He is now 6 years old and will be graduating in less than 3 months. It has been an enriching 4.5 years seeing my son grow and develop under the care of CDS. I am very grateful for how his teachers, principal and staff showered him with love, encouragement and patience in his growing years. I am thankful for the constant partnership we have with his class teachers to help him achieve and progress in terms of his academic learning and character building. Sending my son to CDS is one right choice for our family. Thank you Ms Jervis, Sinyi lao shi and teacher Janine. We will miss you., The teachers here are all very attentive and friendly..

There are other childcare centres closer to home but I can feel the concern for the children from the staff here which is the most important thing., The teachers are very responsive and interact a lot with my kid who refused to speak in the beginning.

Carpe Diem Starlets 2,"Trusted the teachers with my son but yet the teachers just anyhow release my son to other people(cps) when they dun have any authority from me or my husband. I can never trust the teachers again. Broke my trust, Great place for the little ones to pursue an honest education. All four of my kids love it here!"
Carpe Diem Starlets Sparkle Pte Ltd,"I enrolled my child in Carpe Diem Starlets Sparkle  and I couldn't be happier with my decision. The staff is incredibly friendly and knowledgeable, and they go above and beyond to ensure that every child feels welcome and comfortable. The classrooms are bright and spacious, with plenty of toys and learning materials to keep the kids engaged and curious. I love that they offer a well-rounded curriculum that includes everything from reading and writing to art and music. Plus, they have a strong focus on social-emotional development, which is so important for young children. Overall, I highly recommend them  to any family looking for a nurturing, stimulating, and fun learning environment for their little ones."
Catholic Kindergarten,"3hours preschool programme for age 18 months to 6 years old. Strong curriculum, loving and caring teachers. Cleanliness is good and the school control the spread of viruses well, keeping parents informed of presence of viruses even from other levels. Food wise, children are exposed to junk snacks and candies from N2 level during celebrations. If this is your concern, inform the class teachers., Won‚Äôt advise."

It is amazing to just sit at the Benches cafe and see the little children running around the park.Beautiful school with lots of greenery. Exciting outdoor activities are conducted every day. Smiley and pleasant teachers that welcome us at the door every morning. It is amazing to just sit at the Benches cafe and see the little children running around the park., The school is within a park and my child gets to go outdoor play. The teachers are caring and communications are prompt so far. They have a good team of teachers, principal and admin staff. Overall we are happy with this school and most importantly, my child looks forward to school everyday., Disorganised, teachers keep quitting, low teacher to student ratio, poor communication in general, more of a Japanese school rather than an international preschool. Will not recommend., Nice preschool with lots of greenery around it"
Chatsworth Preschool - Piccadilly Campus,"Best school ever! The staffs, teachers and principle of Chatsworth Preschool are really dedicated individuals that strive to nurture every individual children at every stage of their learning process and growth in the school. Proud to have my son attended Chatsworth and will miss the school!, My son 2.5 year old son attended Playgroup at Chatsworth Preschool at Piccadilly in May 2023. Unfortunately, our experience has been deeply disappointing, prompting me to share these concerns on Google Review.  Within just two weeks of enrolment, we received an email highlighting issues with his adaptation, leading to a premature assessment and labelling. Despite my efforts to address these concerns with the school, including a phone call with Principal Ms. Farah, I felt dismissed and pressured to withdraw my son during our conversation.  Subsequently, we received regular negative emails from form teachers and Principal Farah, despite evidence of my son's progress, supported by videos I provided. A distressing face-to-face meeting in September 2023. The atmosphere during the meeting was uncomfortable, with Ms. Linda the admin person appearing stand-offish. An ultimatum was given to my son by Ms Linda saying that he would not be promoted and demanded us to withdraw him immediately. This experience has left us profoundly upset and raises concerns about the professionalism of the staff especially considering the school's approach to child development and parental collaboration.  Nevertheless, we also brought our son to seek professional assessments from various therapists and they found NO Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) symptoms, contradicting what the Chatsworth staff blindly suggest (without explicit confirmation) that has contributed to an unwarranted urgency to remove my son from the school.  In my plea to let my son stay on in school, I agreed to try out therapy to address concerns. I've requested time, explaining that early intervention takes time to show results, but an unreasonable ultimatum was given, stating he must show compliance by November, which anybody will know is an unachievable goal within a two-month timeframe.  More communication consistently emphasized potential conditions such as ASD and ADHD, causing unnecessary stress without proper confirmation from qualified professionals. This approach not only demonstrated a lack of empathy but also significantly impacted the overall well-being of my son and our family.  The final and perhaps most absurd blow came when I recently discovered that despite our decision to withdraw my son at the end of 2023, the school has chosen to keep him separated from his classmates, placing him in the playgroup classroom. *This decision was never communicated to us as parents.  While I understand speech and developmental delays that my son has,  it's distressing that my son is not allowed to be with his friends for the remaining month. Placing him in a playgroup classroom seems unnecessarily isolating and contradicts a supportive environment and this isolation is an act of discrimination  I decided to reach out to the HQ, and after two phone call conversations with the center manager Yvonne, I received conflicting responses. On the first call, she suggested she will do an investigation because she agreed with me that 'the school should not have mishandled this situation and that more time should be given to a 2.5 year old, acknowledging it's too early to judge especially when boys develop slower' , while the second phone call ( the next day ) she stated, 'there is nothing we can do, and I will choose to trust my team.' This is vastly different from her initial stance which left us dumbfounded.  I actually came to a compromise and suggest to the centre manager Yvonne that I am fine with him being with unfamiliar younger playgroup kids but could she maybe allow him to join his batch of friends for activity time so at least he gets to learn something during his remaining time there, meanwhile for day to day routines he can be with younger group if that means making 'life easier for the teachers'. But alas, she told me no. Even this, she was not able to do. I actually feel sad for my son, and helpless as a mother, there is nothing I could do to stand up for him. Leaving this review is our last resort, as we want to prevent others from going through what we experienced., Squirrels, trees, fallen leaves on the path and mystical ambience, where nature stays true to everyone, welcoming children to spend their beginnings with friends and laughters., I love Chatsworth! Sent both of my girls here from 4yo to 6! Staff and teachers are like your family!, Beautiful campus set in the aerospace park. Wonderful staff and faculty. My son loves his new school!, Highly recommended. Good teachers and a professional team to manage the overall development of the children., Well rounded mix of education and play; staff (not just the teachers) who genuinely seem to care for children; good mix of kids; proper English spoken : no Singlish; actual school grounds that are useable and are used; could be Singapore's last kindergarten in a countryside setting. This observation made : 2013., I love this school!! Very good school for both of my kids!!, a good place for your kids to learn and explore, Thank you, Good school., ayy lmao"
Cherie Hearts @ Charlton Pte Ltd,"I Attended Cherie Hearts during the years of 2009 to 2013 and it left many fond memories and fun times, my teachers (from nursery to k2) were especially caring and helpful. I Really appreciated the support and help the teachers gave me and my friends, making sure we understood the lessons and made sure we ate enough and slept enough as well. I was able to make many friends there as the classes usually required us to have some group works and projects which helped instill values such as unity and empathy to better understand my classmates and build relationships. These values carried on into my primary school days and even now as i‚Äôm a young adult, I really felt included and appreciated among friends and teachers there. The food was nicely cooked and always served on time, they also give us time for play which was very much appreciated. Helping us stay active and make friends through our play. In summary it was a really fruitful experience and journey with Cherie Hearts and would definitely recommend to all parents and future parents. Thank you üôè, My 3 boys attended this school from 2009 onwards and we had positive experiences throughout our journey together with them till 2019 when my youngest son graduated. The attention and love from the teachers are genuine and sincere, attested by the gifts they give from their own expenses to my boys and other kids. When my boys had issues adjusting especially during early days in the playgroup, Brands the Centre director and teachers gave me regular updates and photos to assure us how they are doing and put them inside the office to ensure they are comfortable and not disturbing other kids. They do this when the boys are unwell or need calming down due to adjustment / separation issues, Brands or any teacher would be inside to keep them company and ensure their safety. The Centre has grown along with my boys through the years and we can see the improvements and efforts made to ensure a safe, healthy environment and developed curriculum to support our children to cope well in the primary schools they go to. We were also invited last year to attend their 20th anniversary with my boys and were delighted to share in the joy with existing parents our warm and enriching experience with Cherie Hearts@ Charlton. They have been an absolute blessing to our family., Cherie Hearts at Charlton introduced programs which are beyond the  curriculums/lessons like I love Reading Day, Young Entrepreneur Day cum Start Small Dream Big - Charity Drive and Family Day cum Children‚Äôs Day.  Yesterday we celebrated Family Day cum Children‚Äôs Day at Bird Paradise. The children had fun together with their friends and parents. It‚Äôs good opportunity to bring the kids out together with their friends and this is also a day which the kids look forward to.  I hope the school continues to introduce such learning programs to teach children and a way for parents to bond with their children through such programs.  Thank you for putting in so much effort in organizing.  Mummy of K1 class., cherie hearts is a school that is fun for the children. as a practicum student, i enjoyed the culture initially when i first started in the centre, but towards the end it was not as welcoming, particularly from the teachers in my class. however, this is only my experience as a practicum student. if you are looking for a centre for your child, this review can be dismissed. given a chance to work with a different class with different teachers, perhaps my experience would be better :) either way, thankful for the experience and thank u Teacher Noni for being so approachable and kind. also, i think food wise, it would be better to have more nutritious food for the children and teachers, I came here as a Polytechnic Student on Internship and I would like to commend Teacher Elaine and Xiang Laoshi for their exemplary attitude and disposition towards the children. The children felt very safe in class as they were respectful and supportive to each and every child. Moreover, the teaching strategies used were catered to each and every child to ensure they understood the lessons. The facilities in the school are conducive though I feel like the classrooms and play area can be a little bigger. All in all, the teachers really care about their students well being, Cherie Heart at Charlton introduced multi-literacies curriculum-based learning that enhances children‚Äôs holistic growth and allows them to gain personal success and develop a joy for learning. This is a place that also gives educators a good environment to amplify their career development. I enjoyed working with a great team and leader Ms. Brand., I am pleased to recommend Cherry Hearts üíï @Charlton to any family seeking a nurturing and enriching environment for their child's early education.  From the moment you step into this centre, you can feel the warm and welcoming atmosphere. The director Ms NG, teachers and all the staff are exceptional, and they have created a culture of care & support.  Today, we attended the centre's 20th Anniversary & annual concert, I was delighted to see the kids confidence and commendable stage presence, truly enjoyed all the performances üëè, Newly enrolled but my babies love it here already. Very happy with the school team, very prompt and proactive. Especially respect to Principal Ms Brands Ng for her passionate care and love for the school and children. Truly a school uniquely its own., Cherie Hearts @ Charlton is a place where you leave your kids for learning and have a peace of mind at work. We send our daughter there when she was 4 after trying a few daycares around  our area which she does not fit in.  The commitment of educating the child starts from the owner Ms Ng right down to the cook aunty Yup. My daughter takes this place as her second home. She built friendships that she carries with her till these now at the age of 11. When Teacher Cecilia calls for assistance in events the girls never fails her. This is the type of bonding the child has with the school.  Besides the normal curriculum, the school provides lots of extra enrichment for the kids to try on and  that enable us as parents to spend quality time with our kids after work and during weekends. Ms Ng stresses a lot on family bonding . She even organised family outings for the family may it be overseas or local; we never missed it.  We have never felt more at ease when we dropped off our daughter every morning.  Thank you Ms Ng and staff of all the care and hard work.  Happy 20th anniversary and many more years to come., Hi, my son attended this childcare many years back however I remembered it vividly. I was told the incidents of HFMD was minimal however the exact month my son was there, he was down with HFMD, and on the 3rd month too. During one incident when he was down with fever, the teacher locked him up in the room on L2 till dismissal (when they should have just called us to pick him up earlier). Few months later, we observed bruise marks on his arms on a few occasions. The principal and teacher said it‚Äôs due to ‚Äúplay with other students‚Äù. After so many unpleasant incidents, we decided to forego the deposit and take my boy out from Cherie Hearts at Charlton. How would we even want to continue that last month (after reporting these unpleasant incidents to the principal and teacher)?  These kind of experiences can leave scars on children for years! In fact, they even leave psychological scars / guilt on parents - I‚Äôll think why I gave this childcare centre so many chances? What else happened to my kid (prior to my discovery?). Could all these be avoided if only I trusted my gut feel, (as well as granny‚Äôs observation outside the centre) and take him out earlier?  Am so glad nowadays, the policing of childcare sector is more stringent. There‚Äôs definitely a lot of improvements in the childcare space!  Why I‚Äôm sharing this review is because of a Straits Times article today about similar incident which happened to a 3yr old boy, (which ignited the bad memories). The psychological effects are real‚Ä¶, Today we are celebrating Cherie Hearts @ Charlton 20th years anniversary. We are impressed when we see our boy performance on stage. We would like to express our appreciation to Teacher Jasmine, ÁéãËÄÅÂ∏à, Teacher Misah for wonderful support and guidance. ‚ù§Ô∏è We have made the right decision to send our boy to Cherie Hearts@Charlton., Cherie Hearts @ Charlton have dedicated teachers treating kids with care, warmth and dedications. They always organize different activities, our son is happy and enjoy going to school. Kudos to Ms Brands, PG teachers and all staffs @ Cherie Hearts!, Dear teachers,  We are most grateful for your care, patience and loves rendered in educating MK all these years. And we thank you for the many precious moments and wonderful memories spent with MK.  Cherie Heart is certainly an important part of MK's childhood with many invaluable learning experiences.  Once again we are thankful for everything. We wish you health and happiness for the many years to come.  Warmest Regards, Parents of Ming Kiat, My boy‚Äôs graduating from Cherie Hearts at Charlton this year. Looking back, I have no regrets with choosing this place to be his second home.  When we first enquired with the school, we dropped in to pay a visit to view the place and see how the students and teachers were. This was a few years ago, but I recall the elements of safety in the premises and willingness to inculcate lessons on things like recycling on top of the regular curriculum stood out for me.  The school itself, I like that it‚Äôs an actual house instead of some unit in an office area or a void deck. It gives the children a nicer environment to be in. They also have regular trips to the nearby park so the kids get fresh air and are in a safe and quiet area all day too.  I feel like my boy has learnt plenty from the curriculum. But beyond that, activities that encourage Green initiatives and creativity have helped nurture him in other ways apart from just the academic.  If you are curious about enrichment options, there are plenty. From football, to ballet, to art, to abacus, there are options for different skill sets and it‚Äôs all conducted in-house, so it‚Äôs also great for parents who don‚Äôt have the logistics to send their kids to another place for extra classes.  Over the years, I‚Äôve been both impressed and keen to join in on trips and excursions for the kids, just to be a part of their activities and bond with my boy more. The more educational ones have been interesting, but the more ‚Äúfun‚Äù ones like the big cycling events and the K2 camp were really great to join or spy on the kids from afar.  The school also gives termly reports on your child‚Äôs progress, but will also reach out to you whenever necessary to update you on your kid‚Äôs happenings in school if required. They are transparent and open with their communications to you, so you can feel at ease. They truly work with you too.  My boy will miss coming to this school for many reasons - his friends, his teachers, the staff, the place too. I will also miss attending their events with my boy and other parent-friends too.  Your kid will also learn to ride a bicycle pretty fast when you get to K2 with the school!  Also, Congratulations to Ms. Brands Ng and the whole school for hitting 20 years! Truly, the school of love., Today‚Äôs performance was really a success! I‚Äôve enjoyed all the performance by the kids and was very touched by the big kids (alumni) who came back to show love & support of Cherie Hearts @ Charlton 20 years anniversary., Although our daughter is not fully adapted to school yet, Brands and her team were great help and encouragement in helping her adapt.  She and her teachers will regularly update us with photos and videos, which was especially reassuring to us. Special thanks to Ms Chin for her updates, Qiu ËÄÅÂ∏à for her patience in sitting with our child and encouraging her to finish her milk, Mdm Liu for comforting her when she cries on drop-offs and encouraging and ensuring that she finish her meals.  Brands is also very hands-on with the children at her centre and she makes great effort to interact and bond with them. Her teachers and class assistants were also loving, patient and nurturing to the children and never fail to help ease our concerns regarding our child. She had also created a warm and friendly environment amongst her staff that we felt welcoming during drop-offs and pick-ups.  The school‚Äôs communication to parents is also clear and regular. They have many centre activities that also help to bring much variety in the children‚Äôs learning journey.  Appreciate Brands and her entire team‚Äôs effort, concern and dedication they have in running the centre and for the children!, Thank you for taking care of my baby boy. Mrs Brands Ng and her team of teachers are excellent and passionate for childcare. It takes a village to raise a child and it really shows.  There are many teachers at any point in time to take care of the children and you can see them in action on cctv. It's a lot of hard work and dedication and I'm thankful for their care and guidance with my son, In my 5 weeks attachment, I really enjoyed my time here! My host teachers, Teacher Elaine and Xiang Lao Shi were very nice and helpful towards my attachment here! Good childcare to send kids too!, I have learnt alot throughout this practicum and all the teachers here are very nice to me as well. I learnt that sometimes little details can cause a huge difference in lesson plan so i need to more careful as well. Thank you to all the teachers in cherrie hearts@charlton for this experience., The teachers are friendly and helpful, and the environment is well-maintained and conducive to learning. There are plenty of interesting programs and activities available for kids to participate in, which is a great way to keep them engaged and stimulated.  Overall, I think Cherie Hearts is a wonderful place for kids to learn and grow. While I can't say whether it's the best choice for every family, I can certainly say that I've been impressed with the quality of education and care that my child has received here., I am grateful to have an opportunity to have my child to be this preschool.  Branch director allowed my child to play before admission. That was a good opportunity for my child to get used to school.  Despite not being able to speak a lot, my child has become accustomed to this preschool in just 3days and is enjoying going there. Perhaps my child feels comfortable in teacher‚Äôs care.  I am also grateful that they can accommodate allergies for lunch. (During the viewing, we knew that some preschools do not offer allergy-friendly meals.) CCTV, Daily notification of what children learned, regular personal interviews, these are some of the things that make me feel safe.  I think my child will gain numerous learning with acquiring languages. I am sure this is great experience for my child., My youngest son just joined his brother in Cherie Hearts @ Charlton. He‚Äôs currently enrolled into playgroup. Our initial worries of him adapting to school were quickly addressed as the teachers were patient in helping him cope with the transition. We have also seen marked improvements in his enthusiasm for learning and we are thrilled that he is always excited about going to school. Kudos to the management team and teachers!, It is a great school and organises a lot of activities for the children! The teachers also have regular sessions to update on students progress which is really good!, Special thanks shout out to all Teachers of Cherie Hearts. My 2 girls Clara had graduated & Claris is currently in Nursery. Best pre-school for kids! üëçüèª üëçüèª üëçüèª No regrets! ‚Ä¶, We are deeply grateful to enroll our child to Cherie Hearts @ Charlton.  Thank you for making us feel comfortable being away from our child while at work and caring for him beyond our expectations. Appreciate for making our son feel entertained, loved, special and contributing to our child's growth and emotional well-being. He really enjoys going to school everyday. We cannot thank you enough for all your commitment to our son learning journey. ‚ù§Ô∏è, My daughter transferred to Cherie Hearts from another school and I can see the difference between this school and her old school. Communication with school management is open and prompt. They are also organized and disciplined when it comes to getting the children to take care of their belongings and hygiene. When I ask my daughter what she learnt at school she actually remembers and will share enthusiastically about her day. Instead of saying ""I forgot.. nothing.."" My son also started school at 18 months in July, the same time as my daughter and so far he has been enjoying school. I receive very prompt updates on his well-being. Highly appreciate the professionalism and care the school takes with my kids. Thank you! Update: Jan2024 My daughter P has just graduated class of 2023. Thank you CH for building wonderful memories for her and guiding her to become a confident girl ready for pri 1., We just transferred our baby to Cherie Hearts last December. I see drastic changes in her behaviour and moods in just a few weeks. She becomes more expressive and cheerful compared to her old school. She is really happy here and the teachers are very attentive to details which make me as a parent feel safe to put my loved one here.  As a working parent, I don't have so much time to observe what is going on with her. This school gave so much insight about my baby which I am appreciated and I know what to work on so that she can grow better.  Thank you the teachers for taking care so well of my baby!, Would like to thank Cherie Heart and the wonderful teachers for their patience, care, and dedication to educating Charlotte and Charice. The girls have cherished beautiful memories from their preschool experience. We will certainly miss the school!, Our girl has been attending Cherie Hearts @ Charlton for the past few years, and we recently just sent our 18 mo boy there. Love the attentiveness of the teachers and staff, and there are also regular updates from the school about their progress. We can see significant improvement in our daughter (e.g. becoming more independent, developing an interest in reading etc). The branch director is also super friendly and will always provide assurance to us that our kids are doing fine at school. Appreciate it üòÄ Strongly recommend Cherie Hearts @ Charlton to other parents., Deeply grateful to be able to serve my 6 months internship here at Cherie Hearts @ Charlton! It has been a very memorable and meaningful learning experience to be able to work with generous and loving staffs who look out for one another and constantly look for ways to improve. Children are independent and the centre highly values partnership with parents and the community by organising monthly park visits., Our daughter attends to this early childhood education center. She loves going to school, enjoys the enriching activities and guidance from her teachers.  We like how the school is open and transparent with their communication with us.  We also enjoy interactive feedback from the school via their internal platforms and the kind attention that they place on our child.  Thank you Cherie Hearts @ Charlton for the positive school experience for our child., Friendly and fantastic teachers, professional and loving staffs. We have been entrusting them with our twins for 2 years and we could really see how much the kids have grown with the tender loving care and nurturing given. Just attended the year end graduation/concert performance today, it's pretty astonishing and a precious experience we enjoyed together with the school. Great work Brands and team!, Teachers and principal are proactive and will engage the parents regularly. Good environment for children to learn and grow!, The teachers here are quite friendly and go the extra mile to make sure the children feel comfortable. The first week my son was at the facility he was quite shy and his pre nursery teacher helped him feel at ease throughout his first week and onwards. I also noticed a lot of growth in my son after starting, I feel like their teaching is very productive. Another thing that my son likes is their excursions, the school sometimes will bring the children on outings for trips to places, be it the farms, to memorials, firestations, etc and it is something the parents can opt to do with them as well that the kids enjoy a lot.  I would definitely recommend üëå üëç ‚ò∫Ô∏è, An excellent school with teachers who care deeply for the children. Our son enjoyed his time there and learnt so much and we would definitely recommend this school to other parents! Thank you to everyone at Cherie Hearts for making our son's experience a great one! ü•∞ ‚Ä¶, Amongst the myriad of preschools available In Singapore, my husband and I felt that we have found a gem in Cherie Hearts at Charlton. We have 2 children currently studying at this school.  What stood out for us was that this school seem share a very good relationship with the parents. It‚Äôs upon enrolment we begin to understand that they believe in creating a holistic integrated learning environment for each child where topics taught In school will be reinforced then at home, vice versa. Parents are keep informed of the children weekly learning thematic activities which centers on building language & arts, motor skills, social& emotional , creative expressions. The school is organized with their curriculum planning and day to day operations. Gives us assurance that every matter will be attended to properly.  This is also reinforced by the very dedicated and passionate teachers / staff with who see each child as who they are and seeks to nurture them to their individual potential. My 2 kids look forward to going to school everyday .  If you are looking for a school to nurture your child foundation years, Cherie at Charlton comes highly recommended! Great job well done Cherie Hearts, you definitely are my first choice for preschool selection., As first time parents, we want the best for our daughter and we have actually looked around for a few pre school for our kids, and Cherie hearts @ Charlton has left a deep impression in me because of the principal Ms Brands Ng who showed us the school facility and also showed us the curriculum.  I like what they shared because of the soft skills they impart and the values they teach for the young ones to grow up to be a responsible individual for themselves and for society. Something that‚Äôs not just book based.  Additionally, when our child is enrolled to Cherie Hearts in 2021, Ms Brands has always very transparent and direct with her communications and we like that we can always reach her should we have any enquiries etc. so we are very well assured putting our first born with the school and will also be registering our second born with Cherie Hearts @ Charlton too. Personally, I have recommended my personal friend to the school who has also enrolled to the school.  So be assured that this school is the place for your little ones to grow up as a fine and cherry child with plenty of happy memories with their friends!, Cherie Hearts @Charlton is a great place for kids. The location is nice, quiet surroundings and close to big parks so the kids have regular outdoor activities or just simply walk to the park and have some fun there. The teachers are all so caring and nice. The school shares regular updates via different communication channels and as parents we're happy we receive regular updates of the kids. What I like most is that the school encourages kids to read, even at young age so they build their reading habit early and gain interest in reading. I strongly recommend Cherie Hearts @Charlton to other parents in the area., My son has been at Cherie Hearts for only a month and we are amazed to see how much he has improved over that time. The teachers are professional, caring and well organised. The admissions process was outstanding, they really care and truly want the best for the child. He is always happy to go to school and full of smiles when we pick him up. I attribute this to the exemplary teaching and community feel of the school. He has learn art, nature, music, as well as getting a strong foundation in letters and numbers. The perfect balance of free play and guided learning. Can't wait for our little girl to start in August. We are so fortunate to have this gem in our neighbourhood. Thank you, Cherie Hearts Staff., I was very fortunate to spend six months here for my internship under the guidance of a very warm & encouraging group of staff members. The children were very nice and lovable as well, they were a motivation for me to continue in the industry. The partnership between the school and parents is very strong, which was one of my key take always from this internship., Our daughter attended school since Playgroup and it was really a wonderful experience for her. Teachers and all the staff are caring and helpful, communication with the school is excellent with many channels (WhatsApp, app, booklet etc.). The enrichment classes options are nice and there are always outdoor activities (whenever it is possible) which we really appreciate. There are regular updates on the child progress, our daughter could barely speak when she joins the school and before 3 years old was able to speak fluently 3 languages ( Chinese & English thanks to school and her mother tong French spoken at home). A big thanks to everyone and especially Ms Ng who is extremely nice and caring, we will definitely miss the school and highly recommend anyone who is looking for an excellent school with a pleasant environment and great teachers and staff, your child will feel loved in Cherie Heart ü•∞, Highly recommended, my 3yo son loves this school so much thanks to the teachers and amenities. Teachers in the school are super friendly, attentive and proactively communicate with parents to provide helpful feedbacks. Felt lucky to have chosen Cherie Hearts @ Charlton ‚ù§Ô∏è, My daughter transferred to Cherie Heart Charlton 2 years ago after a bad experience from another school. We love Cherie Heart Charlton so much. The experiences we had from the teachers to the Director, from the child's well being to the academical  aspect, physical aspect and emotional aspect, were excellent.  The school planned every activities structurally and communication between the teachers and parents were excellent. They could also explain  to parents the curriculum of the child before and during school term to give us a sense of what they will be learning throughout the year. Am also glad that the school shared with me on their curriculum plans for the child up till they are in K2. Knowing that the K2 will be well prepared for Pri one.  My daughter had grown so much over the last 2 years and is enjoying herself everyday.  Highly recommended school., The teachers here are amazing! You can tell from the way they care for your child. Patience and Thoughtful. I'm so glad my boy enjoys spending time here. Special shoutout to Ms Ng, Ms Cecilia, Ms Chin & Ms Qiu. I'm so glad we had chosen this school., The teachers and staff in Cherie Hearts are very attentive and caring. They took note to details and very patient towards our son and daughter's learning process. They teach our children to be more independent. Thank you!, I visited several childcare centres in the Kovan area and decided upon Cherie Hearts@Charlton because of the conducive environment, transparent management and dedicated teachers. There is open communication between the staff and parents, and constant review of their curriculum to stay relevant. My two boys could read and write fluently by the second half of the year in K2. The staff and teachers also put in effort to organise many activities and outings to ensure a holistic education for the kids. I would highly recommend Cherie Hearts@Charlton to any parents :), Been searching high and low for a preschool that meet my expectations, I‚Äôm glad I made the right choice enrolling my daughter in Cherie Hearts @ Charlton. The teaches and branch director are all actively involved in keeping me up to date on my child development, which I‚Äôm really grateful for. The centre is well organised and definitely a conducive environment for learning and growing., Attending Cherie Hearts @Charlton is one of the best decisions we have made for our kids.  First and foremost, we love that there is a good connection between the school and the parents, taking us along the learning journey of our children. We feel at ease especially with the regular and somewhat prompt updates of their weekly activities and matters.  Just a few months into their(our kids) 1st years in school, we noticed a vast improvement in language, motor skills and attitude towards learning.  I feel the Teachers there exudes a certain level of passion, and love for nurturing children, that they sincerely care and wants the best for each child. This leads to another point we love about Cherie Hearts @Charlton; Character-building, which in my opinion, is extremely important in the foundation years.  My kids will excitedly go on and on about what the teachers said or what they did in class almost everyday after i pick them from school (less the few moody days) We are happy the kids are enjoying their time in school. A well-organised and a very balanced cirriculum i must say! Thank you Branch Director Ms Ng and her team of teachers for your hardwork and dedication. Cant wait for my daughter to join in Oct!  Definitely a well commended Pre-School., Cherie Hearts is a great place for child. Teachers are very fantastic and kind. School compounds are very clean and tidy. Highly recommended!, LO has been attending since playgroup. Big shout out to Ms Ng (Branch Director) she‚Äôs extremely friendly and approachable. Always personally at the school gate during drop off and pick up timings so that we at least can catch an update. Love that this school has cctv, we can check out what the kids are up to throughout the day.  Our experience has been very positive! Ms Ng knows her kids very well and would not hesitate to help and assist when we need. They put in great effort to help the kids adjust especially when my boy took a long time to overcome the separation during his first month at school. Many updates via WA throughout the day making sure he is well taken care of.  For younger classes, they also make sure at least one teacher from the previous year would follow the kids up to the next class so that the kids would have a familiar teacher in the new level.  I love that they offer enrichment classes in the school itself so my boy can attend extra classes within school without us having to ferry him to external enrichment lessons. All within the CC timing!  My 2nd would be attending as well, looking forward! Big thumbs up to Ms Ng and her dedicated team üëç, Cherie Hearts @ Charlton is a great school with very caring, patient and dedicated teachers. Ms. Ng is a wonderful Branch Director who is very helpful, understanding & reliable. My two elder sons graduated about 10 years ago, my family always remember and appreciate the love and care from the teachers in Cherie Hearts. Now my youngest son also just joined the school, we trust and believe that he will be able to learn and grow well in Cherie Hearts too. Thank you!, Love this preschool. teachers are kind and helpful, a lot of activities held. I can monitor the performance of my kid through CCTV. My kid loves the school!, Being my child's first time in school, Cherie Hearts Charlton has helped to allay all my fears with their timely updates. Ms Ng is more than just a Branch Director, giving us the support we needed as we prepared ourselves for our last minute decision in schooling our child. She is approachable and always patient in answering my queries.  The teachers in my child's class have shown so much affectionate towards her that my clingy little one acclimatised to school within a short span of time. I really like how they plan exciting activities for the little ones. It's the highlight of my day to have a glimpse of her school day through the daily montage that her teachers design during the children's nap time. Such dedication and efforts in immortalising her moments in school is very much appreciated! üòÄüòÄ  Thank you Cherie Hearts for giving your love to my child and making school-going such a breeze for us!, I would like to share the review for Cherie hearts Charlton. Elina mantha from k2 had a great experience with Cherie hearts. Her journey from PG to K2 is beautiful experience. She has lot of adventures, trips, learnings. Teachers are  wonderful, supportive and always responsive. Good job teachers. We will miss cherrie hearts for ever but we have great memories., Cherie Hearts @ Charlton is a very nurturing school that is filled with kindness, love and warmth like a big caring family. Although my child has newly joined the school since April, my child has really benefitted alot from the interesting and holistic bilingual curriculum, class lessons and activities, learning experiences ( Messy Play, Surin Park outings, learning excursions etc), home-school partnership activities, interesting and enriching project learning experiences and the imparting of lifeskills and positive values (such as kindness, caring for the earth etc). The communication between the wonderful team of management staff and teachers with parents are very good as we often receive prompt, responsive, regular and constructive feedback, helpful advice or updates with regards to our child. Im very grateful to Ms Ng and all the staff and teachers here at Cherie Hearts@Charlton for providing such an enriching and nurturing environment for all the children to bloom and grow :), Ever since enrolling my son in Cherie Hearts @ Charlton since playgroup, we have seen many improvements in him. He is now in Nursery and has shown great improvement in his speech and problem solving ability and has also become more independent too. I would definitely recommend this preschool to other parents.üëç ‚Ä¶, Branch director and teachers are very helpful and responsive, and even take negative feedback positively, giving assurance to the parents, like u know we will be worried for our child sumtimes. They are very attentive to the students there, and a lot of activities for them. They Will constantly update on what‚Äôs happening n how‚Äôs my baby boy doing. And school is equip with cctv which u can also view ur kids activity. Branch director is also very hands on which is quite impressive, she knows what‚Äôs happening all the time, and also an animal lover, which is a plus point. Will also enroll my no.2 baby to Cherie hearts. Also recommend people to Cherie hearts!, I would like to share my positive experience with Cherie Hearts @ Charlton for the past 6 years. We have 2 children under the school's care and only have compliments for the schools staff and programmes especially the monthly Surin Park Day and Messy Day. As parents, we believe that learning best takes place inside and outside of the classroom and making lessons fun encourages interest in exploring and creativity. Our children always look forward to Surin Park Days and Messy Days. Keep up the good work Cherie Hearts @ Charlton!, Participated in the Japan Trip (Kyoto-Nara-Osaka => Tokyo) in May-June 2023 organized by CHC. It was a fabulous trip where a lot of places visited have provided a lot of learning opportunities and eye-opening live experiences to our son. Big thanks to Ms Brands who have organized this very well.  I give it an Overall 9.0 / 10.  The missing 1.0 point is for the following improvement : (1)  0.5 point - Red-Eye Flights (to-and-fro), while saving costs, but maybe a bit tough for young kid. Don't mind spending additional 2 days to travel with the normal day-time flight. (2)  0.5 point - The Osaka Zoo can be replaced by the Tokyo Ueno Zoo which is much bigger and more interesting.  Big thanks to Ms Brands and CHC again !, Was given the opportunity to fulfil my practicum hours here twice and found the children to be very independent. Teachers are loving and there are all kinds of optional enrichment courses available for children. The centre values a strong partnership with children's parents and family as well. :) Thank you to the teachers and staff who guided me patiently. Thank you Ms Kartini and Ms Ng!, My girl has been with Cherie Hearts Charlton. since PG and I am so glad that she is there. I trust the management and the Teachers in taking care of my kid and they have done a very wonderful job at keeping parents well informed and spent a lot of effort preparing home based learning materials. Kudos to Ms Ng and her team., It was a wonderful experience working here with many caring teachers and joyful children. Each day was fun-filled with engaging lessons. Special thanks to Ms Gladys who have been nurturing and guiding me patiently me since day one, and to Ms Noni for her constant check ins with us. ü´∂üèªü´∂üèª ‚Ä¶, Nice family-oriented childcare centre. Teachers are loving, warm and responsible. Curriculums are well-rounded, with plenty of opportunities for preschoolers to explore their strength and interest. Highly recommended!, üí™ ‚Ä¶, I also graduated 7 years ago from Cherie Hearts. You have probably seen Shane's review, which is below mine. I managed to get into the same school as him (RI, if you're wondering). I had many meaningful and wonderful memories in Cherie Hearts, and I can still remember many of the activities we had, like Wet Day, as well as the teachers who taught and nurtured us., My parents enrolled me into Cherie Hearts @Charlton when I was 2 years old. I was with them all the way until when I went into P1. All the teachers there were very friendly and taught me lots of interesting stuff, like drawing, simple mathematics, etc. I remembered there was even a once-a-week water play, where we mass around with water and throw water bombs around. Can't remember what's it called. But that was fun! I remember there was even an overseas trip together with the teachers to JB where we spent one night at LegoLand. That was a very memorable trip for me. I was there for 5 years and I truly enjoyed my time there. I have to thank my parents for making the right choice to enrol me into Cherie Hearts@Charlton., Thank you Cherie Hearts @ Charlton for shaping Maryam into a confident & independent little girl, we can see the amazing transformation in few months of time. Please accept our gratitude for everything you did for our child, she is so attached to her teacher that she asks to call her sometimes over the weekend also.  Appreciate the positive learning environment you provide for your students, keep up your good work!, The preschool is not as expensive as it seems because parents have a choice of allowing their children to partake in the various enrichment classes the school has to offer. I did my attachment in this school and the educators here were all very professional and responsive towards the varying needs and interest of the child. Everyone (i.e the children) has their needs catered and the dynamic of the educators, parents and children here is very well developed. Would definitely love to visit this preschool again!, Loved interacting with the children in the centre, they‚Äôre all very unique and special in their own ways, not to mention full of love. Big thanks to ms Cecilia, ms noni & luËÄÅÂ∏à for guiding me tremendously during this journey with Cherie hearts!, My kids have been to 3 different kindies, 2 in Singapore & 1 in Malaysia. Out of the 3 kindies Cherie Hearts Charlton is the best. My older girl was a very shy girl that hides behind me all the time & never answers people. After she was in Cherie Hearts for 3 months she was a much more confident kid, talks to people & not afraid to go up to the stage to dance. This kindie keeps the parents updated after every semester on what the students have learned during the semester. When my kids were in the other 2 kindies I had no idea what they were taught in school. During the CB when all the schools were asked to close the teachers quickly prepared worksheets for the students to bring home for the online classes. My kids were practically occupied the whole day. Morning was teaching & talking to the teachers & friends via skype & in the evening was story telling & singing & dancing. This is a good kindie to send your kids., Kudos to Cherie Hearts @ Charlton for conducting home Based Learning during the CB period. Apart from the lessons there are craft works, story telling and dance clips by the teachers which are very enriching and informative. Thank you teachers and Ms Ng for the effort to make this home based learning a successful one ! keep it up !, I like to give a shout out (in appreciation) to Ms Ng , all Teachers and staff at CH@charlton. My older daughter (who is currently in P1 now) joined them mid-way in K1 from another ‚Äúpremium‚Äù preschool. At that time, her literacy and reading skills in both languages were poor. With help from the Teachers and their reading program, she made tremendous improvements by term 3 in K2. She even knows hanyu pinyin better than me! Now that she‚Äôs in P1, she has no issues in reading, spelling or Âê¨ÂÜô because CH@charlton has prepared her well. CH@charlton also has fun activities like messy day (water play), Surin park day and K2 graduation camp which my daughter enjoyed and misses till this day. Overall , a good school with responsible teachers  and staff. My younger daughter continues to attend this preschool  and is reaping the same benefits. I am so glad I‚Äôve made the switch for them., Dedicated team of teachers who went the extra mile during this covid-19 period. They prepared all the worksheets, videos and even gave extra materials like crayons, glue, paper cups for their work. They were not only open to comments about their curriculum , they were constantly also trying to  improve the delivery of the lessons during this trying time.  It is a school that will prepare your child well for an education in Singapore context as they engage their children in a all rounded education e.g.with outdoor learning through their park days, civic lessons e.g. picking up litter, using recycled materials to teach about importance of taking care of our environment to service learning lessons such as performing for an old folks home.  A collective team of teachers and principal that works well hand in hand. The staff knows the students from various classes , as much as the children know the different staff from various levels. I highly recommend this school., I had a great practicum experience in this centre as the teachers and staff were nice and patient. They gave good and effective advice for classroom management. There were many things to learn from them regarding the teaching strategies and classroom management skills., Very responsible and responsive school. Addresses the concerns directly and not beat around the bush or brushing away the concern.  Interactions with staffs of different levels have shown a consistent level of genuine care and concern towards the children.  Very pleased with the school so far., Reliable and professional teachers and structured system. Principal is responsible and friendly too. Gave usefuladvice on how to handle kids at each stage. Centre has range of activities too. Recommend!, During the practicum period of four months ,I learnt alot . The management ,staff everyone nice to me . Treat me like one of them. Envirnoment is very nice  for younger children to  learn and have  fun . Thank you teachers and Cherie hearts ., I finally found you Ms Inez.  What happen to your post on Cherie Hearts Singapore FB review? You shared your comments & i did so likewise. I have the videos of you (1) storming into the school compound, (2) behaved rudely to the teachers and (3) u fell mainly because of careless. I wanted to post it for many to review but u deleted your post before I can do so.  Nevertheless, I have printed screen shots of your comment in this review, implying my kids to be ‚ÄúSelfish, self centered & inconsiderate‚Äù.  To many out there, this lady, Ms Inez, choose to walk this path (nearest to school) during peak hours where many parents drop their kids to school everyday. The school is located within a landed cluster and in order to prevent traffic congestion, at each time 2 cars need to inch over the pavement to allow other cars to drive through. Fyi (1) there is another exit point approx less than 15m (approx less than 15 steps) away & (2) the exit thats nearest to the school was applied by the school director by means of official application & approval for parents who commute to school by means of public transport or foot.  In the video, you will be able to observe that the paveway though obstructed marginally by the cars, theres still ample space for both abled and disabled man to walk through with ease. If I were to describe, even a hippopotamus can scroll through with ease.  Also in the video, you will be able to observe her making statements to the teachers while walking away. She didn‚Äôt observe her path and obstacles and that led to her falling down like a log & sustained abrasion on her knee as reflected in her previous Fb posting.  In a nut shell, everything didn‚Äôt fall in place for her that morning & she blamed the school for everything. What kind of human is this.. the more I see her comments implying my kids to be a potential delinquent, the angrier I get! I am seriously looking into pursue legal action on her. I bet this is a very STOMP worthy video too.  The teachers in this school are considerate, kind & Importantly, Caring to my/our kids.  To Cherie Hearts HQ or anyone out there, you may write to me if u need the videos., Very dedicated school management and Teachers. Spent lots of time preparing materials for home based learning. I heard a lot of other schools don‚Äôt even give HBL to students.  A very ‚ÄòON‚Äô school. Definitely benefited our children., I really like teachers creating the environmental awareness for children to dispose recyclable materials in to their respective bins.Love the water play area,MSD activity area where fields are covered with artificial grass that brings real comfort and happiness in doing the activity.Teachers are caring and friendly.Overall I believe it is a  second home for the children where they emphasis learn through play approach.I had a wonderful learning journey experience üôÇ, Good childcare centre, where children are given opportunities to  learn through play and experiencing a wide range of artistic, cultural, educational, social and physical activities., Kudos for arranging the 2 days 1 night camp and night cycling! It‚Äôs really amazing effort from Cheriehearts to make this happen! Such a great experience for the children! Thank you!, Caring teachers and hands on administrator! My boys tell me about their activities in school and I can tell they enjoy spending time here., Great leadership, kind and helpful office staff and very nice and brilliant teachers My girl learned with fun and grow confidence, My kids went through hard time of transferring schools and they were warmly welcomed and well taken care of by Cherie heart Teachers., Overall , v good effort in organising the concert esp after the 2 years break due to pandemic. Would prefer to be held on saturday instead (like previous rounds)., Fun, adorable, exciting and entertaining performances ! Well done !, It is a nice centre and I enjoyed coming here to work., Very professional teachers and very responsive staff all the time. Structure is well organised and provides pleasant experiences for both kids and parents., Good job Cherie Hearts teachers. Appreciate the extra effort to do up the learning videos. My kid is looking forward to the daily sessions. üëç ‚Ä¶, This school is such an educational place! I like it cause it's a place where children can blossom and live their dream!! It's very organized and helpful, it's also a good place to learn manners!, I graduated 7 years ago from Cherie Hearts and now i still remember it lol so many good memories of the performances, teachers and wet day., Loving the teachers‚Äô efforts in preparing for the concert, and teaching the children on all their lovely performances., they made my 2 week internship amazing‚ò∫Ô∏è, Thank you to the staff for their warmth and dedication. We were very happy for our daughter to join even for a short while., The playgroup kids were adorable, Amazing center, creating memorable experiences for my child that i thought was very up and beyond compared to other childcare ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è, Great school. Good communication, and teachers are responsive., Kudos to the staff for a wonder Sports Day 2023!, nice school"
Cherie Hearts @ Mountbatten Pte Ltd,"I have send both my kids there since infant. Both my kids love it there. My first born already graduated from there last year and she said she missed Cherie hearts. The teachers are passionate and caring. The teachers and parents communication are also great and I get to know what my kids are doing or what they need to improve on. They have a lot of activities for the students as well.  I have a peace of mind when I send my kids there as the function room where the kids gather for play or activities are all made of top to bottom glass windows. So you can see you can see what your kids are doing.  Thanks to Cherie heart that my child able to transit well into P1 due to the dedication of the K2 teachers who prep her in the fun and enriching way., 2 kids from infant till kindergarten.  Overall a good school with good teachers. Kids not objecting to go school everyday. Few things that stand out will be the optional enrichment classes after school curriculum. Save the hassle of sending them to private centre and all the evening/weekend. Elder 1 loves the science and art class.  2 will be the outdoor activity. The school is in a quiet neighborhood with plenty of playground. On top of the sensory garden and mini playground within school. Also biweekly water play. I think this is the big plus point since they are not confined to air-con all the time. Downside probably will be we need to find similar activity over the weekend to burn their energy., Sent our kid to infant care here. Amazingly patient and experienced teachers who put in a lot of effort taking care of our kid. The teachers are even more patient with our kid to an ourselves. E.g. my kid doesn‚Äôt like to drink water and I get lazy feeding him water sometimes but whenever I sent my kid in, the water bottle always finished!  I feel that the teachers know my kid well and they are very patient with our requests. It has been a very warming experience for first-time parent like us., Our son completed his preschool years at Cherie Hearts Mountbatten after 2 other pre-schools have up on him in 1-3mos time. the teachers and staff at Cherie Hearts are highly capable and has lots of patience. they work with parents for the continuous development of their child. they genuinely care about the child‚Äôs well being and my husband and I are super grateful to CHM. PS. Our son is in P1 now and he is doing just fine, all because CHM also help K2 kids seamless transition to P level., Sent my baby when she was only 4 months old. Teachers (miss pamela and tracy) were so good at helping my baby to adapt to new environment. They also keep me updated about the baby via school app. As a first time mum, I feel relieved to know that my baby is taken care of. Thank you!, I will be succinct here. My son was enrolled as an infant at the age of 3 months. While I find the teachers very caring, the same cannot be said of my experience with the owner and the mgt. More importantly my boy was constantly getting ill. While I have already enrolled him under pre nursery at another centre, I could not longer wait till be turned 18 months to withdraw him. I decided to withdraw him at around 15 months and emplaced him at another centre. Since then he never missed a single day of school and has been coping very well with the transition and health. I pondered for a while if I ought to transition him into another school just for 3 months and decided to do so as the situation at cherie hearts only got from worse to worst. I honestly hope their situation and staffing levels have improved for the sake of every other infant or toddler enrolled. And this is my honest review of this centre., Both of my kids were with Cherie Hearts. Our elder daughter has been with them from PG until K2. We did not send kids to any other schools to compare but from our view, the school is good and really caring for the kids. The principal, the teachers are very engaging.  Given that the school is one of the most affordable in Mountbatten area and the quality of service is fairly good, I think this school can be a good option to consider.  Some parents may be very particular and have stronger opinions but for us, we really see nothing wrong with the way the school has been operating., We had sent our infant to this school. Although the care in the school is okay, we withdrew our child within the stipulated 2 weeks trial period because we found one closer to our place. Even after many many repeated follow ups , we still haven‚Äôt received our deposit or the remaining fees back. There‚Äôs no follow up or update from the school either. It‚Äôs been 3 months. As a parent , it makes you question the management of the school and why they handle their finances so poorly., Our child was happy here, they have good app to track progress of the child., Such a great infant care and child care., The school will be completely new in 2024, giving us many surprises! It has been three years since my second child graduated, and she still misses her teachers occasionally. Now my third child has graduated from infant here to K1. She also likes the teachers and classmates here very much, and she can leave a lasting impression on the children. An impressive childhood is inseparable from the hard work of teachers! Thank youüôè"
Child at Street 11,"Very very bad preschool services highly not recommended., Great childcare which caters to each individual child's need."
ChildFirst @ Mountbatten,"Very thankful to the teachers at ChildFirst @ Mountbatten who truly demonstrate their love, care and belief in my children through their tender, yet firm teaching.  Their curriculum is very well structured and systematic, their language immersion (the children HAVE TO communicate in one language (Eng/Chinese) only) for half a day each language, really helped my children gain confidence in speaking in Chinese. Early exposure to robotics and computer lessons also equipped them well.  My elder boy used to struggle a lot in managing his emotions and the teachers in CF, really took time to understand him and taught him coping mechanisms which I really appreciate., My son was at ChildFirst for K1 and K2. His Chinese improved tremendously and he also had a lot of fun learning coding. The overall curriculum was outstanding. The school developed their own reader series and unique teaching system., ChildFirst is an excellent pre-school. All the teachers and non- teaching staff are very nice and professional! They are trilingual school and the curriculums are good and well designed especially the coding lessons which is special and unique. My two childrenbhas built up a very strong chinese foundation at ChildFirst. They likes to go to school every day. We really appreciate the efforts and the care from the teachers., Teachers and facilities are good. However, increase in fees is exorbitant, does not commensurate with singapore's inflation rate (~4-5%). Fees rose by 10% in 2022, and 20% in 2023., My daughter WXY absolutely loves her K2 English teacher Ms. Siti. She talks about her teacher regularly at home. It‚Äôs clear their connection and engagement are very strong and super positive. We have full trust and confidence in Ms. Siti and the ChildFirst team. Thank you to all the staff and teachers!, Great school, which has very advanced educational program, which includes Emotional Intelligence, AI and Robotics. My child really enjoyed every day at school during almost 3 years. We moved from another country when she was 3 and she learned English and Chinese at Child First very fast. I recommend this school to everyone, who wants their children to learn and play in very friendly environment., Wonderful experience and journey for my boy and parents, Thank you so much to Dr Yen, Principals, Teachers, and everyone at ChildFirst for your love and dedication in helping to nurture my son, Rayden and prepared him well for his life journey ahead! God Bless!, My child enjoyed his time in school which had provided a comprehensive learning environment with their tri-language programme., Very very bad school, can't keep teachers! Lots of untrue reviews., teachers are great and campus is big"
Childfirst@Dunearn Pte Ltd,"We had a fantastic experience with childfirst both in terms of the curriculum and even more so the staff and teachers. Would highly recommend the school., Greatly recommend Childfirst KAP ‚Äî my daughter has a very enriching & fun presch life thanks to the centre‚Äôs staff, be it the teaching/admin dpt. My top priority before enrolment is hygiene & disease control ‚Äî I‚Äôm confident to say they are really one of the better ones. As the kids consume their meals only in their own classrooms (not a common dining area like most schs), contagious illnesses like hfmd are contained within the class, instd of rapid spread throughout the whole ctr. During the covid years, the sch also managed to control as well as they could. To my personal knowledge, our cases are really much lesser than the ones I heard from my friends. So rest assured the staff in the sch are really vigilant. Also thankful most parents are cooperative & responsible too.  Childfirst‚Äôs curriculum is undoubtedly one of the best. My child can read well before pri.1, in both English & Chinese. She also enjoyed coding lessons very much. The kids are able to use the PC/mouse independently since a tender age (well-equipped Computer room where evyone has a desktop to themselves). The many opportunites for performances (during festivities) /presentations (show&tell, current affairs, personal sharings over the PA sys) groom my child to be a confident speaker, always ready to volunteer or express her thoughts.  Last but not least, the staff in the centre are really genuine passionate people who care for our kids‚Äô well-being. Professional, experienced, humble, good vibes and all. I‚Äôm glad my girl has an awesome 4 years (N1 to K2)., Strong curriculum especially for Chinese and Coding. Teachers are generally warm and caring but firm. The environment is spacious  and welcoming., Good place for the kids to learn multiple skills and kids enjoy school, Thank you slurrr"
Childfirst@Tampines Pte Ltd,"Spacious, tidy and clean child care facility. The speech and drama room is big with plenty of role play activities for the kids. They also provide coding lessons for N2 to K2. Daily half day Chinese immersion program will helps the kid to have plenty of chances to interact and practice Mandarin. Didn‚Äôt give a five as there‚Äôs no outdoor activities, all indoor based., The teachers are very caring and passionate. A great environment for preschooler., Good program and very caring teachers, Good curriculum and teachers. Good food!, Great childcare to build your children's character"
Children√Ç¬ís Cove Preschool Pte Ltd (Novena),"Been sending our kid to this school for the entire year and very happy with the choice.  Despite the Novena address, the school is located in a quiet suburban pocket in a quaint colonial house. The kids use the garden often for various activities including sand play / water play, and get tons of sunlight and activity.  Teachers are the best part - they are friendly and caring and also communicate regularly with parents. The atmosphere is a warm and comfortable one, and a lovely addition to the neighborhood community., Teachers are friendly, caring and with great patience. My kids became more independent in everyday routines. And they love to connect with friends. Also learning to regulate their emotions better. The outdoor area with garden are great learning resources for children., My boys enjoy this school so much! The teachers and staff are so dedicated and caring and the get togethers they organize for us parents really help us and the children bond! ‚ó°Ãà Highly recommend if you are looking for a well-rounded preschool experience for your child., We enrolled our son starting from PN and he really enjoys the school curriculums and very good interactions with the teachers. The parent and class teachers are well connected to know the progress, issues even after the working hours., Teachers are caring and communicative.

My child really enjoys school ‚≠êÔ∏è, All the teachers at Children‚Äôs Cove at Akyab Road are caring, patience and showers tremendous love to the children. My kid enjoys going to school everyday and can‚Äôt stop telling what‚Äôs happening at school., We love this school for our 2 yr old.

My 2 boys thoroughly enjoy school., Great environment with teachers who always go the extra mile!, Excellent development of our 3 years old, really appreciate it, Great and cosy children school in the neighbourhood., Great school and teachers"
Children√¢¬Ä¬ôs Cove Preschool - Orange Grove,"I'm really happy with Children's Cove at Orange Grove, where my daughter goes. It's a great place because the classes are small (this is so important!), and the teachers are super caring (this is the most important!).  The best part is the communication ‚Äì they keep us updated with photos on the app, even for small things like if my girl Willow gets a tiny bite from a friend during playtime. Every day, when I drop her off, the teachers are all smiles, which makes me feel good about leaving her there.  Willow never gets bored because they have lots of hands-on activities. And it's a close-knit community, so the kids have become good friends, and I've made friends with other parents too.  I visited quite a number of childcare centres two years ago, but I'm soooo glad I picked Children's Cove. A big shoutout to Ms. Sherlin, Wang Laoshi, Ms. Malar, and Xiao Laoshi for looking after Willow so well.  In short, Children's Cove is a great place for your child. I highly recommend it! Thanks, Children's Cove!, Sending our kids to Children's Cove Preschool has been a good decision for our family. The teachers nurture each child under their care.  The small community is a real gem; it creates an environment where everyone knows each other. This intimacy also ensures that every child receives attention.  Communication with the teachers is prompt. This daily interaction provides insights into our children's experiences and allows us to address any concerns promptly.  Most importantly, my kids look forward to see their friends and teachers in school!, 1) the management of the school is really very disappointing. (Think the principal had left school) I had applied for giro to pay school fee, had emailed forms to her, but after a few months still no update, then she told me cannot find the form. I emailed again, but again I don‚Äôt know what happened, after months of waiting, still not set up. It FINALLY was set up after I emailed her for the third time!  2) I met a girl‚Äôs mum in a playground, she withdrew her daughter out because the management is lousy. I don‚Äôt believe at that tome, but I agrees with her a few months later.  3) I decided to withdraw my child , but again the refund hasn‚Äôt been given back after few months. They asked for cpf statement, working status update, all these I had given to them before, but don‚Äôt know why they seemed lost again.  4) new principal is better, at least replied my email! I had to email many times for previous principal!  5) Teachers and school activities are ok  Hope the new management team will be more responsible and responsive., Just want to get the record straight based on the negative and most likely unjustified and fake comment posted prior. This is an amazing Kinder/Day care with very professional and attentive staff really caring for the kids. My eldest spent 4 years there and my youngest is still enjoying his time at Children's cove so don't make an opinion on one negative comment. Go and visit the place and see by yourself the professionalism and level of attention Children's cove will give to your kids., undiscipline  school and person."

The teachers are also very attentive in caring to the kids., Been sending my kid here for 3 months, she's had a steady improvement with her social skills, motor skills... Initially when sending her she would always cry, and for like the first week she'd cry for the whole day... Now she only cries when I pass her to the teachers and she's generally okay to play around without bursting into tears... The teachers give regular feedback on my kids behaviour and what we could practice at home to make the transition to school easier... I am forever thankful to the teachers for their patience and kindness in taking care of my little one and have 0 regrets sending her to this wonderful school ü´∞üèæüòä, I went to the centre for internship, all the teachers were very friendly and shows a lot of love for the children. Teachers and Principal were always open to questions., Preferred only easy children"
Children's Cove Preschool - Sembawang,"Exceptional school with a strong commitment to both academic excellence and the overall development of students. The teachers are highly dedicated and create a nurturing environment that fosters creativity and teamwork. My children have thrived here, achieving impressive academic results and developing essential life skills. I highly recommend this school to parents seeking a well-rounded education for their children, The principal and all the teachers were so welcoming right from the beginning to help ease my girl into the school environment. My girl love the teachers and having loads of fun in school from Day one. I‚Äôm also rest assured that my girl is well taken care of as all the teachers are all very loving and genuinely care for the students. I highly recommend children‚Äôs cove at SSC to all parents who wants to send their kids to a preschool with loving teachers and nurturing environment üòä, A preschool set in a shopping centre offers many authentic learning experiences for children. Other than literacy and numeracy, life skills are also taught and practiced often. It takes a village to raise a child, but in the case of Children's Cove at SSC, it feels more of a family raising a child instead. Staff are dedicated and strives for the best while nurturing the young ones under their care/charge. My thanks to the Principal Ms San for her leadership, and both teaching and non-teaching staff for all the care and love shown to my child., I cannot express enough how fortunate we feel to have found this infant care center. The principal and teachers genuine care for the children create an atmosphere that is both nurturing and supportive.  From our few months of interaction, it's evident that this community of educators truly love what they do. The personalized attention and warmth they provide make each day a joy for our little one. The staff's commitment to creating a safe and enriching environment is truly commendable.  Our baby not only enjoys going to the infant care center but thrives under the attentive care of these professionals. It's heartwarming to witness the positive impact they have on our child's development. As parents, we couldn't ask for a better place for our baby to grow and learn.  Thank you to the entire team (Ms Sankari, Teacher Kavi and Teacher Ain) for your outstanding efforts and for making every day an adventure for our little one!, We have sent out girl there since she was 18months and seen her grow so much! The teachers and principal have had such great impact on her character development as well. Very thankful for all their care and concern! :), My son joined Children‚Äôs Cove Sembawang Shopping Centre last December.  It‚Äôs the best decision I have made for him.  I have visited several childcare centres before I settled on Children‚Äôs Cove.  The student-teacher ratio is the lowest with a ratio of 6 to 1 for playgroup.  This childcare centre is also relatively new in operation during the Covid pandemic in 2021 and they have further expanded recently.  Being new means that all the facilities are clean and in good conditions, all the classrooms and common areas are nicely decorated with warmly theme and child appropriate educational toys.  The centre has also employed 2 aunties, 1 for the cooking and 1 for general cleaning.  Hygiene level is always their priority.  At the other end of the school is a door which directly opens and leads to the building‚Äôs playground.  Communication with the teachers is prompt via the apps.  They keep us updated with photos during the weekly update and on ah-hoc basis whenever interesting moments of my son occur.  My son‚Äôs main teacher-in-charge is a very assuring teacher who is bubbly, meticulous and always willing to go to the extra miles to ensure my little son and all children are safe, sound, happy and on track to reach their development milestones.  His Chinese teacher is a very enthusiastic lady who spices the class with excitement, engages and sparks the curiosity of my son to learn.  I have no issue to address any concerns to the teachers promptly.  This is a close-knit community.  The teachers are bonded to the children, parents and among each other.  I like how thoughtful the principal and teachers are, for instance, arranging to dress up in same colour code during excursion for easy recognition or even having flower petals on their hair which was just to create little spices for the Parents' Day event.  The teachers are more like a guardian and a friend than a service provider.  A heartfelt thank you to Teacher Jie Ying and Zheng Lao Shi for spending their time, energy and love to shape my child‚Äôs development for the better.  A sincere appreciation to the rest of the team under the leadership of Ms San, and especially to Yang Lao Shi, Hu Lao Shi and Teacher Eunice for taking care of my son despite not in their classes.  All in all, I have no regrets sending my son to Children‚Äôs Cove, Sembawang Shopping Centre.  This group of teachers is a gem to cherish., Im greatly and thankful to have Hu Laoshi and Teacher Eunice who are caring and dedicated. I feel reassured and less worry for me knowing my son is in good hands. I would also like to thank Teacher Jia Ying for taking care of my son. She is caring yet firm. I like her bubbly nature and her thoughtfulness. Thank you to everyone who help nurture my son helping him grow to be kind and thoughful of others. With guidance from both Hu Laoshi and Teacher Eunice, Adam is confident in speaking up and and he is constantly curious and wanting to learn more. He developed self esteem and perserverance thanks to his Hu Laoshi whom constantly encourages him. I see improvement in my son. My heartfelt gratitude to her. I would also like to thank his principal Ms Sankari for giving him encouragement and always trying to engage the children. Thank you to all the dedicated teachers and principal in Sembawang shopping centre childrens cove., Nice environment for size, clearance and safety.  Teacher are professional and very patient  to guide and teach kids.  My daughter and son learn a lot and appreciated all., My 3 year old absolutely loves going to school here and that is attributable to the wonderful and loving educators. Highly recommended!, Very friendly and engaging teachers, great place to send your kids, I‚Äôm insecure with many issues happened to my kid and the school didn‚Äôt take serious and reply to my request."
Clementi Woods Kindergarten,"The pastoral aspect is very good. During HBL, the effort to create engaging in-house videos and worksheets/ workbooks helped children to continue learning., Great neighborhood kindergarten, my son spent ~2 years here and he loved it"
Creative Thinkers Preschool Pte Ltd,"My partner and I have been so impressed with Ms Sakinah, Ms Aisha and their team at Creative Thinkers. Not only is my (R) child well cared for, R is also educated and has better manners from attending. R looks forward to going to daycare there and is always left in high spirits. R's clothes used to always come back stained at the daycare we attended overseas but at Creative Thinkers R is always kept clean. We love the CTP family!, Good Teachers, Preschool"
Crestar Learning Centre @ Woodlands Civic Centre,"This is run by the same company as Kinderland, the infamous childcare centre that abuses kids! Google it for yourself!  Beware!"
Da Little Preschool in Tamarind,"Da Little Preschool isn't just a place for learning; it's a community that embraces every child and family with open arms. Communication with parents is exceptional. We receive regular updates on our child's progress, and the open-door policy makes it easy to discuss any concerns. We're grateful for the positive influence it has had on our child's growth and development. Highly recommended!, Great school with ample outdoor space and area for children to play and explore. Curriculum is structured so it's a good balance of learn and play. Teachers are wonderful. So loving and caring toward each and every child, very supportive and provide timely feedback with childs performance. Overall, I'm very pleased with Cambridge as my child have lots of positive memories there. Happy child =happy parent!, My children have been in this school since PG for both my 1st & 2nd ones & have graduated. Now my 3rd one is here :) I thought it will be awesome for me to share my experience & my children's experience here. Their preschool years had been awesome with the school. They have passionate and committed teachers and educators üë©üèª‚Äçüè´ whom are very caring towards the children. They always do their best to care & educate them. They gave timely updates. The staff are all warm & friendly. Curriculum provided has also equipped my child for formal school. Now their primary school journey are smooth. Thank you Cambridge Preschool@YCK. Thank you all for the effort & love for the children. A preschool that I would recommend to parents., No accountability at this school. My LO had bloody lip injuries not once, twice but thrice in 2.5 months under mysterious circumstances at this school and the N1 teachers, principal and centre manager claimed no one had seen anything and shirked all responsibility. Don't be fooled by their so called low teacher-child ratio. They don't know how to look after children safely. In the 4th incident at the school in Feb 2023, another child had swung a door right into my LO's face. Major safety lapse and the centre manager refused to show any CCTV footage despite it being the 4th incident at this school. My advice - skip this school., They used to have a good principal and lots of good teachers when I enrolled my kid in year 2016. However, most of the good teachers started to leave the school one after another. In short, I do not recommend this school with their high school fee and with this quality.  Pick-up/Drop-off: Very hard to pick up/drop off your kids as there's no allocated carpark. My car used to scratch by the neighbor's next door automatic gate when I was there to drop my kid.  Facilities: No improvement or renovation for the facilities at all over the 4 years my kid was with them (Wall painting doesn't count). Same old playground, toys/equipment was used in the center. Only added toy is used tyres. However the school fee just continues to increase every 2 years.  Enrichment: Only Phonics is useful and with certain Quality. English Speech and Drama: Normal and nothing special. Chinese Speech and Drama: In order to 'lure' my kid to join the Chinese S&D, they told the kid you get to draw (knowing that my kid loves drawing). So, I enrolled my kid for the first year. However, the teacher was seen scolding and shouting at the kids before the school concert, which obviously just want to showcase her ' good work', but not really letting the kids to enjoy the class. Thus, withdrawing my kid from the class after since. Calligraphy: Calligraphy for kids who can't even write properly with a pencil. I learned Calligraphy too, and the pre-requisite is always to be at least P3 for my time. I didn't know kids nowadays have evolved so much to be able to take on this at such early age. My personal encounter: My kid was lucky enough to be taught by one of the ex-teachers, and she was a very committed teacher, which my kid's Chinese has improved over the 3 years with her. However, the English teacher was not professional enough and not equipped with the correct skill (The teacher is still with the center). During the PTC, when I asked the teacher how we can work together to improve some of my kid‚Äôs skill, the teacher told me ""I don't know how to handle your kid, I am not an expert"". When I feedback this to the principal, the answer from the principal is that you cannot expect all teachers to be so committed like the Chinese teacher. Note: The English teacher used to teach N1/N2 class, but due to high turnover, she was tasked to teach K1, and that's when she has problem with her class management., The teachers here are all very warm and friendly, when I ask questions they answer with reasons for me to understand. The are many toys and gadgets to allow your child to learn in a fun way, some of the toys are creatively made from recyclable materials. This shows how qualified they are for the job. Highly recommend, Childcare Centre with an outdoor space for children to play and run around., Very good quite place"
DAS Chua Chu Kang Learning Centre,Overall ok but why always change teachers!
Eager Kids Montessori,"My daughter just graduated from K2 at Eager Kids Montessori. The 3 years she spent here has shaped her in so many commendable ways. The guides are very passionate about Montessori principles and follow the same in every aspect in the school. Students of this school stand out from those from traditional schools with regard to personality, perception, curiosity, learning abilities and discipline. We couldn't have asked for a better school for our child to get started with. It's a very clean, well-maintained, safe and fully equipped Montessori school. I'd recommend EKM to anyone who is passionate about their child flourishing overall and not just in academics alone., Finally, a school that exists for quality education and not pure business. Even though there were not so many reviews/recommendations online, after visiting the school, we decided to give EKM a try. Looking back, this was the best decision we ever made for our son. In 2 years, he has become a confident, responsible and caring child. He has developed a positive attitude towards learning. Anjum and her team are doing a great job in inculcating the Montessori culture in school and educating the parents to do the same at home. During COVID times, they managed pretty well in staying connected with the children. They observe every child keenly and give honest and in-depth feedback to parents. Under their care, every child feels that he/she is important. Learning is not limited to language and maths but also extends to geography, science, arts & crafts and even practical life. I would recommend the school to anybody who is looking for a place where their child can grow in every sense., You all have been great mentors and guides. our daughter is so fortunate to have been placed in Eager kids Montessori. You all have amazed and inspired her daily. Never in her three years of schooling she felt bored. She wanted to go to school even during holidays and she learnt many practical lessons which are much needed in our day to day life. Everyday was a new experience for her. She is so bonded with all of you and her friends so much that she will miss all the fun.  You have not only guided the children but also the parents in every step.  Our sincere and heart-felt ‚ÄúThank you‚Äù to Anjum for giving us all the support and guidance and for being a wonderful teacher. We are truly inspired with your ideas and methodology.  Teachers Vidya, Alaka ‚Äì Thank you for being a truly outstanding Teachers.  From the bottom of our heart, We wish all of you a great success in all your future endeavours and also inspire and train many children.  Thank you... Tejaswini, A great place to start your child's academic journey and build love for school. A place where your child will always be ""Eager"" to go to. Wonderful teachers and appealing classroom., Great place to kindle your child's interest in learning . Proactive staff who help your child to become a responsible and independent individual., A place where kids can feel second home :), Not enough information"

E-Bridge Pre-School 670 Edgefield Plains,"There are many mosquitoes in the weeds in front of the school. I get bitten every day. The wounds are red, swollen, hard and itchy, and it takes more than a week to heal. There are also many wild dogs gathered under the bridge leading to the bus station outside. They will attack people and bark very loudly, which is very scary. Wild dogs appear at playgrounds and school gates every day, making it very dangerous to pick up and drop off children‚Äº Ô∏èToday I also saw a child being chased by a wild dog. It‚Äôs very dangerous‚ö†Ô∏èChildren in kindergartens will also encounter wild dogs when playing outdoors at school. I don‚Äôt know how the school handles it.

E-Bridge Pre-School Pte Ltd (126A Canberra Street),"Child enjoys going to school, and overall has had a positive experience so far. Teachers and assistants are generally kind and efficient, with regular monthly updates in the app and ad-hoc verbal updates as needed.

Only odd thing is that the principal keeps changing for some reason, with 3-4 replacements in the last ~1.5 years., Every child under their care is well taken care. Good job. Continue the positive words and care for the little ones."
E-Bridge Pre-School Pte Ltd (140 Corporation Drive),"Enrolled my son to IFC this year. Positive experience so far. Teachers are nice and activities planned are good for the infants development. I like the fact that the infant bay is separated in another building (good to have during covid period), One of the latest facility by Eton Bridge located within Yung Ho Spring I, Taman Jurong. From the looks of the learning and activity space it has, I would say it is ready to take alot of applications. Has a full size kitchen even to cater for kids meals during the day. Overall positive impression of the place, but suggest parents to visit during the day for a closer look and ""test the water"" with your child before deciding., A premier early childhood centre located in Taman Jurong, 140 Corporation Dr, Singapore 618592."

Might update in the future but let‚Äôs see, It's meaningless to put the phone number on webpage while the center don't bother to answer the calls. Until I paid a visit to the center, then only they answer the call with bad attitude. What a bad experience., What‚Äôs is the point of having a Carpark within the school premises when the school doesn‚Äôt allow the parents to drive in to pick up kids after school?  Moreover, COVID-19 situation, isn‚Äôt Higher chance to get the virus when school management expect parents to park at nearby carpark and walk in, fetch the kids and walk back?  Seriously these ‚Äúmanagement‚Äù need to think out of the box instead just set this kinda rules.  üëéüèº, We had a terrible experience here with the school administration. Poor communication and a disturbing lack of integrity.

She has also made many friends in her class and forged very strong bonds through the numerous excursions.  She is always looking forward to going to school everyday.  Highly recommended to all parents who are looking for a school for their children in the Toh Tuck, Bukit Timah Area. a big thank you once again to everyone in ELF., I am glad Bilal and Fatimah went to ELF Preschool as they have very Wonderful teachers and staffs! They are very warm, passionate, friendly and very enthusiastic! The children love the bouncy castle and the funtastic Friday where the teachers have fun activities for them to enjoy! Would definitely recommend the school! üòçü•∞ ‚Ä¶, ELF is the best preschool that I have encountered so far! Their show and tell curriculum helps my boy to have confidence and good speaking technique. The most fun part is they have outdoor lesson which not all preschools have and this is important for a kindergarten kid!, My children have enjoyed their time at ELF. As a working mom I was absolutely relieved to leave them in the care of ELF. The whole school feels like a warm cozy set-up for young children to have a home away from home. The activities and enrichment programs were a hit with my children, especially bouncy castles and little chef program. The teacher make an effort in making every child well-rounded! Their outdoor programs were also another aspect which we appreciated to give children more exposure outside school. Thank you ELF and all of the aunties, teachers, Mrs Prem and Mr Andy!, My elder child was with ELF from Nursery 1 and graduated last year in 2022. She has many fond memories of the years spent at ELF - of the teachers there as well as the many good friends she has made over the years. The teachers and staff at ELF are always very caring and nurturing towards the children. They are also always thinking of creative ways to make their lessons interesting and engaging for the kids. The curriculum is also a well planned one which will prepare the children well for their transition to Primary One. After school fun like the inflatable bouncy castle and the on-site playground are also big hits with the kids, who are often then not reluctant to go home too early. Overall, my experience with ELF as a parent is liken to that of a big family where everyone, be it the parents or staff, work hand in hand to provide a homely yet conducive environment for the children to grow and blossom in. Needless to say, the wonderful experience we have with ELF was the reason we enrolled our youngest with their Playgroup programme as soon as she reached the minimum age requirement and we are looking forward to seeing our youngest blossom too under the guidance and care given by the teachers and staff at ELF., ELF provided both our children with an enjoyable preschool and childcare experience. They entered the Primary school environment in 2021 and 2023 respectively with little anxiety because of the preparation provided through their K1 and K2 years. Being competent in their Mother Tongue is certainly a bonus too. Thank you for wonderful memories and for ensuring that Early Learning is always Fun!, We initially chose ELF because of its location but stayed for the caring and professional staff. It has been a wonderful experience for our children, they still reminiscence about their time there even after they entered primary school. 10/10!, I participated in the school carnival every year, it was a great experience. All the kids are well mannered, the teachers are really friendly. Environment is extremely positive. I really enjoyed taking part in the event as a family member., Mrs Prem, Mr Andy and her team of teachers and staff have taken good care of both my daughters Alynna and Alyssa. They truly care about the development and well being of the children. We would highly recommend the school., you can call the school/principal and a person (principal/teacher) will pick it up. You need not go through a filtering AI robot and that meant a lot for me., dedicated teachers and staff. my kids had a great time there."
ELFA Chinese Preschool @ Pandan Valley,
ELFA Preschool @ Hougang,"Awesome performance put up by the children, made possible with the guidance and patience of ELFA educators! It‚Äôs really heartening to see the growth in the children and more so when they genuinely enjoy putting up the concert! Thank you for the effort, Teacher Pat and all the teachers of ELFA!, It was a wonderful concert! I enjoyed a lot throughout the whole concert. I got emotional (because it's my son's last concert in ELFA Hougang) , smile, laugh and greatful. My son used to be introvert and not a good talker. To my surprise, not only he say his speech with confidence and he's not afraid to be on stage! He dance with the rhythm and focus in the role play as cao chao. I can see all the children having great time to perform the items they had learn for long time and to show them to their family members. I can see teachers had put in lots of effort, love to prepare the children and then shine on stage. Thank you teachers and principal for looking after my son also to support him in the area he is weak at. A big thumb up for the concert! Thank you ELFA Hougang,  you all rocks!, Well planned in content, including Chinese drama (from San guo Yan yi), English drama instilling positive values in the children through acting and speaking. It is the best preschool concert I've seen so far.  Hope the school will have more children (once the new bto completes)!, Thank you for the great Organisation of this sports fiesta! It was a great experience to see what our kids are capable of and we had a blast!, My son has been attending ELFA since Nursery, he graduates this year. Our family was still new to Singapore when he joined ELFA, caring teachers and amazing staff helped him a lot to adjust to new environments. I deeply appreciate the staff being nice and caring, and the teachers of ELFA really care about the children and work with the parents. Especially, ELFA‚Äôs curriculum gave my child a strong foundation in Chinese and it will help his smooth transition to the local primary school. I would recommend ELFA to everyone with little ones., We had so much fun and enjoyment moments together. The event was a blast. Thank you for all the hard work and patience teachers., I have seen how my daughter grown to a confident student through ELFA Preschool. In the initial years, she struggles quite a bit in using Chinese. ELFA Chinese curriculum has helped her to be more proficient and developed the love for the Chinese Language. Thankful for the dedicated Teachers and Principal who look after her physical, and socio-emotional well being and cognitive development over her time in ELFA., Our child has been with ELFA since infant care, he graduates this year. During his years with the school, he has grown into a happy and independent child under the care of all the ELFA Teachers. I am confident that he will transit well into Primary school with all the knowledge and skills he has learnt in ELFA. He enjoys going to school everyday and learning new things from his Teachers. Even though he doesn‚Äôt like Chinese, his teachers in ELFA have managed to encourage him to want to learn it, he will come home and share the Chinese poems and stories he learnt in school with us. All in all, a BIG thank you to ELFA for taking care of our boy so well. He will miss you when he moves on to Primary one next year., Our daughter has just graduated from Elfa and we are grateful to the staff & teachers for making it such a memorable learning experience for her in her preschool years. What first drew us to Elfa was the staff - the care and love they had for kids, the happy faces of the kids there as well as the rigorous mandarin curriculum which we wanted for our daughter. Long time staff like Celine and Patricia are always so efficient, helpful and cheerful. Thankful to our daughter's teachers - Teacher Lyn and Wang Lao shi for patiently nurturing and guiding her too. She has definitely grown up to be more confident and is sufficiently equipped to tackle Primary 1 next year!, My son has been in ELFA since infant care and has proudly graduated in Dec 2021. ELFA's curriculum has allowed the kids to grow in all aspects while having fun! ELFA has allowed both parents to work and be worry free while he is at pre-school ! The preparation for K2 also allowed him to ease in smoothly in the first day of school at Primary 1. He loves ELFA and all of the staff !, My infant has been going to Elfa for about 3 months now. She loves coming to school. Sometimes forgets to say bye to me at the door. She learnt a lot of new good behaviour since attending. The staff are great and very accommodating. Very glad to have found Elfa., All was perfect, well prepared"
ELFA Preschool @ Jurong,"Very sad to hear that ELFA PV is closing and the teachers are being moved to ELFA JE. The ELFA PV teachers are all very caring and loving to the children. I see them smiling and happy all the time. In just 6 months, my 4yo went from not being able to speak or understand Mandarin to being able to speak and understand simple Mandarin. He also doesn't hate or fear Mandarin and in fact loves his teachers."
Eshkol Valley @ Northstar Pte Ltd,"My daughter (graduated from Eshkol Valley @Northstar in Dec‚Äô17) and my son 5 years old has been in Eshkol Valley@ northstar since PG. We absolutely love the school! Teachers are incredibly caring and patience towards my kids.

We would definitely recommend Eshkol Valley@ Northstar to other parents looking for a great educational experience for their child., My daughter recently graduated from Eshkol Valley, and she had a positive experience during her time at the school. She made numerous friends and received valuable support from both peers and teachers. It's evident that the teachers genuinely care about the well-being of the children, as some students affectionately refer to their teachers as ""mama"" and warmly embrace them daily upon arrival at the school.  I've noticed a few changes in teaching staff over the terms, but these transitions appeared to be managed smoothly. The school's principal is highly responsive and consistently addresses parents' concerns promptly. Overall, I appreciate the supportive and nurturing environment that Eshkol Valley provides for its students., I've enrolled my daughter in Eshkol Valley @ Northstar since N1 after being referred by a friend. No regret since.

Eshkol Valley @ Sengkang Pearl Pte Ltd,"My son, who is in N2, had a fantastic time attending the preschool in Eshkol Valley and genuinely enjoyed his time there. The first time I visited the school, I liked the school's atmosphere; the classroom was clean, colorful, and well-ventilated. I was also pleasantly surprised by how endearing the kids were. It spoke volumes about the nurturing and supportive environment they experience in class. My son cries a lot every time he has to go to school (he attended 2 preschools before). So I was glad at how easily he adjusted to Eshkol Valley. I am so grateful to the Principal and teachers who created a fun and engaging learning environment for him. Each day, he eagerly looks forward to going to school, and as parents, we couldn't be happier with his experience., My daughter 4yo and my son 2yo have been with Eshkol Valley since their PG age from 18mo. I have so much comfort from the teacher as anxious parent on how my daughter will adapt being separated from me to start her first day. The first 2 weeks was tough, my daughter would cry and throw out due to crying but teachers and the aunties there were so assuring and told me it‚Äôs okay and it‚Äôs normal. They are so patient to say it‚Äôs okay to needing to change her daily and mop the mess my daughter created due to all her crying.  The daily updates from principal/teacher via WhatsApp (now they have school communicate and photo sharing App) on how my daughter are doing for the first two weeks helped me to have a peace of mind and assurance. My daughter adapted and less crying very quicker than I imagined it would be.  She have learned so much in speech, identifying, socialising, writing, trying to read words, etc in English and even improved so much in her Mandarin.  My spouse and I seen how our daughter grew to become so independent and the things she learnt there are really broad and sometime in our opinion deep for her age, example identifying all the planets and remembers them, saying all the shapes include ‚Äòrhombus shape‚Äô. etc. We too have our son joined the sister and seen him grew in fast pace especially in speech.  My son went through a tough 1 week of separation anxiety too but very comfortably adapted to it after and love going to school. Seeing him so comfortably walking in as if he entered his second home felt very comforting.  I love how the curriculum involve parents and children time to accomplish a task. It helps us to bond with our kids and also create meaningful moments and conversation around doing homecraft together.  All the teachers are so dedicated. Their love and care for the children can be seen on how they update you about your children. I remember indicating I wish my daughter to improve in her mandarin speaking in the next term during one of our parent-teacher meet, I saw progress of my daughter really improve in making initiative to speak in mandarin and identifying mandarin words.  Both my children love their teachers so much! Can see my daughter excitement everytime she talks about her teachers and about her day at school. And my son so happy and cheerful to see his favourite teacher at the door so welcoming. It is so heartwarming watch they enjoy school and know that they are in safe environment and are in good caring hands.  All in all, I would definitely recommend friends and families who are planning to send their child to school for the first time here. Both my children built a strong learning foundation here., I got to know about Eshkol Valley Northstar through recommendation from friend. When I 1st visited the school, the principal, teachers and the environment are so warm and comfortable to be in, unlike the 1st preschool I sent my son to. He enjoyed going to school everyday to meet his teachers and friends.  I can also see progress in him within a few months. The teachers are so dedicated and loving to the children. Even though he has graduated, the teachers still remember him when they see him. Now my girl is currently schooling there, she look forward to attend school daily and telling me about her teachers and friends when she gets home. I can see the principal and teachers has put in a lot of effort for every festival, every events held and the progress in the learning journey over these few years. Kudos to all the teachers for giving the kids a wonderful preschool experience., My daughter has a great nursery to kindergarten time in this preschool.  Teachers are caring and patient.  The curriculum is interesting as children are exposed to art and craft and science experiments in fun and exciting ways.  Glad to see how she has grown up these past few years., My daughter has been studying here for close to 2 years and I have seen a positive change in her. She used to be very shy and reserved in her previous preschool but we can see that she is slowly opening up and becoming more expressive and confident here at Eshkol Valley. Her reading and writing have shown improvements too. Teachers here are loving and dedicated. You can tell that they have a heart for children. Really appreciate her teachers for encouraging her to get out of her comfort zone (prompting her to share more during class discussions, trying out new food, assigning her to be class leader of the day, picking up self-help skills, etc). My girl always come home to share all the fun things she did in school. Facilities may not be the best but we really love the warm and friendly atmosphere here. Am glad we made the decision to switch her over to Eshkol Valley @ Seng Kang., Says alot when my son looks forward to school everyday. My two kids went to different preschools and in comparison, i find here to be the better learning environment by a mile and the curiculum more engaging. Teachers are very caring as well. Would definitely give Eshkol Valley Preschool two thumbs-up., The centre has a team of dedicated teachers with genuine love for children. I feel safe and have a peace of mind at work knowing that my kids are in good hands. A very warm and family-like environment where principal and teachers know the name of every child in the centre. My elder boy graduated from Eshkol Valley at Sengkang and still talks fondly of his time there., 4 years is a long time for a 6yo! That‚Äôs how long My girl has been spending most of her life fruitfully thus far! While many focus only on the so call pedagogy and brand, few actually experience the fruits and returns from the most established of the brood.  EV@sengkang pearl is a rare gem that stands out among the lot. When we first moved to the neighbourhood, like most parents, the hunt for a preschool ( or rather, nightmare) begun. We were either put off or turned away by the overpopulated preschools in the northeast region and the journey was disappointing, to say the least.  But as if guided by divine direction, we stumbled upon the ‚Äúland flowing with milk and honey‚Äù, or Eshkol Valley in the bible (confessedly, I missed that in my own bible studies..). I must say that the first tour-around experience was the best, not becoz of over-promising or any dazzling opulence to the exterior, but the sincerity, warmth and now well behaved the kids were! Definitely sending!  In the four years, I saw how my girl with some speech delays initially overcame her challenges and is now able to read Roald Dahl, Enid blyton!the improvement is stellar.  Like many, her Chinese was atrocious but the patience and high standards of coaching has prepared my girl for the rigor of P1 higher Chinese!  On top of that, she has gained confidence from being a quiet and shy little one to quite a ‚Äúperformer‚Äù and story teller!  Values impartation is the next most imp thing that EV has gifted  my girl. The teaching cohort in the school holds on to strong moral values and expect the same of the children as they guide them to make the right decisions and differentiating right from wrong, yet being kind and patient towards those who err.  4 years has gone by in a twinkling of our eyes, and now it is time to bid fond farewell. Knowing that she is graduating, she has refused to even miss a day of school. Farewell, her first teachers school and friends!, Few of the teacher didn‚Äôt care about the children feelings at all. Poor Management. Never take feedbacks seriously., Kid enjoys going there. Good care taking environment, Disappointed with one of the teacher in the way of handling kids in terms of bullying."
EtonHouse Bilingual Pre-School Pte Ltd,Good looking building. It is bery near to FairpriceXpress and 7-11
EtonHouse Pre-School Pte Ltd (Newton),"Would not recommend this school for preschoolers ( can't speak for other branches). Very poor management who only seemed to care about maximizing financial gain from parents. Unfortunately, I had a horrible experience and will certainly not return to Etonhouse. Despite its premium fees, it did not live up to its promise vs other schools. So glad that I relocated my son to another school and he is thriving there with teachers and principal who truly care about the wellbeing of their students., Both of my girls attended Etonhouse Pre-school. I chose Pre school after compared to their international brand because preschool offers more flexibility, longer hours 7am-7pm, less term break(kids can still attend school during term breaks). They both enjoyed their time at Etonhouse and teachers and staff were very helpful and supportive. My girls have multiple allergy and the school was quite accommodating, provided special meals and allowed us to bring own food as well, helped manage their allergy with cautious measure. Their education program provides a good balance between academic and extra curriculum activities. The Chinese teachers are also quite good and taught them Chinese very well. School offered good support to students who planned to go to local schools, as well as to students attending international schools for primary education., A fake international school. Disoriented staff. Introduced me the class teacher on the open day, but end up with another class teacher. English level of the class teacher is low. Teachers in local schools can speak better English ! My kid hates the school that she request to go back to the previous school., Happy to send my daughter to EtonHouse newton! Everyone here is friendly and lovely! Besides, the playground is big and nice!, Went on a merry-go-round yesterday in the estate. Intended to go Eton Preschool but this navi app sent me ti Gilstead road. Luckily the school is along the main road and I self navi my way out., I went to eton back in 2005, it's home to my warmest memories. the teachers were wonderful and kind"
EtonHouse Pre-School Pte Ltd (Robertson Walk),
EtonHouse Pre-School Pte Ltd (Vanda),"Not worth the exorbitant school fees, if you ask me.  My biggest gripe is with the diet. Children were often fed empty carbs such as mantou with no filling, or suspiciously green pandan bao. Refined, processed sugar too, such as Milo. The meals are not prepared in school but in a central kitchen, transported to Vanda and reheated.  Etonhouse prides itself on its mandarin program, but in my opinion it is no use to teach children tang poems and SanZiJing when they have no idea what they are reciting or even just the context within which these poems were written. During our time with Etonhouse there was a high turnover of Chinese teachers ‚Äî 3 in a year.  We chose this school in part because it had a big, beautiful outdoor space (albeit right beside a big traffic intersection) but it was so underutilized. Children did not play outdoors daily, even in good weather. Granted, this was during the pandemic, but if they can be in a classroom together I see little reason why they cannot spend time outdoors.  The facilities at this school were often broken. Almost every time there was a thunderstorm there would be a power outage. There were also a few times when the toilet facilities broke.  There are some good ideas, such as a communication booklet with which you could correspond with your child‚Äôs class teacher. But guess what ‚Äî our questions and comments in the book were never responded to or acknowledged.  I think etonhouse does try to prepare children for local primary schools (get ready for weekly spelling and tingxie at age 5!) but for the money EH charges, the diet and state of the facilities are just unacceptable. Fees increased by ~200 right after we left the school. It feels like we are paying for EH‚Äôs PR efforts and head offices, rather than for the well-being of our little ones., great place for kids to learn and play!, PlaySchool."
Faith Methodist Preschool,"From the very first day my child started at Faith Methodist Preschool, I've been thoroughly impressed by the dedication and commitment shown by the teachers. It's not just about the standard curriculum or daily routines, but it's evident that they genuinely care about each child's well-being and development. Their willingness to go the extra mile is clear, whether it's in guiding the children through challenging tasks, imparting knowledge with patience, or simply showing them affection and care. As a parent, knowing that my child is in such capable and nurturing hands gives me immense peace of mind. I wholeheartedly recommend Faith Methodist Preschool to any parent seeking a comprehensive and caring educational environment for their child., Kind teachers who show genuine concern for the children. They also are experienced and have good understanding of varying development across different children. Great environment as there is sufficient movement across different spaces for different activities. I believe that one telling sign of a good pre-school is the mood of the children, and whether the kids like to attend school. Faith Methodist Pre-school certainly has passed both aspects with flying colors. Furthermore, the children are exposed to a wide variety of learning topics, as my kid returns home to tell me excitedly about what the teacher has shown them in class., We sent all of our 4 boys to Faith Methodist Preschool. The principal, teachers and staff are very committed and patient. It‚Äôs a safe and nurturing environment, which has such a positive impact on our boys.  3 of our boys have graduated and always look forward to coming back to see the school. They had fond memories of the school and this is the amazing work of the principal, teachers and staff. Thank you!, We don't speak mandarin at home, but one day N2 daughter came home from school teaching our helper mandrin. She also started speaking to my parents in mandarin much to our surprise. She also started counting and demonstrating the thing she learned in school.  The teachers here are gentle and friendly. My daughter looks forward to school everyday. Students here are more disciplined than those I see in childcare centres around my house. Maybe it's because the teachers have shorter hours with the children that they have the energy to maintain the discipline in school.  I'm happy that my children are not spending their formative years in a chaotic childcare centre. If there are parents who can afford not to send their children to childcare centres I would highly recommend them to give Faith Methodist Kindergarten a try., My 4 kids are blessed to be students of Faith Kindergarten. A school with amazing teachers who cultivate a positive environment and a good value system for the growth and development of a child."
First Steps Preschool @ Depot Road,"Placed my elder child on the waiting list for First Steps (previously known as Zion Kids) since I was pregnant as this place was strongly recommended by my friend. We did not change child care even after moving away as my children really loved their time here, and the other child care centres I had visited for consideration just paled in comparison. My younger child just graduated last year, and missed being in this wonderful school.  The infant care was great, with the teachers and aunties not only taking care of their needs but also educating them, and kept the parents updated on their daily progress. When they moved over from the Zion babies to the Zion kids side, they had more structured curriculum on top of the treasured play time, which made the transition to primary school academically easy.  The teachers were all loving and nurturing, instilling good values in the children. There were frequent updates on what the children were doing, and many pictures that became treasured memories of all the fun times they had learning and playing together.  The meals were well planned, balanced and nutritious, with my children telling me their favourite meals and even sometimes asked for second servings.  The school environment was clean, with good ventilation, which was an important consideration for me as I did not want my children falling sick frequently. The school would disinfect the whole school regularly, but would also quickly arrange for the disinfection when there were reported HFMD or COVID cases.  No regrets sending my children here. Truly thankful and grateful to the wonderful teachers and aunties in the school., The preschool left a great impression before sign-up as the school tour was led by principal Connie herself, who exhibited commitment to the care and education of infants to young children. This led us to enrol my child since he was 4mo. The teachers are loving and caring, and things are done with the children's interests at heart, like allowing the children time and space to transit from infantcare to playgroup. There are also good enrichment class options provided, saving effort to source for classes outside of child care timings. My child enjoys going to school every day, and we as parents feel safe leaving him in  the care of the teachers there., Our two kids are placed in good care at First Step Preschool. Teachers are attentive and caring, they focus on structure curriculum and put the child interest at best. Parents will have a piece of mind leaving their child for an extensive period of time in school., As first time parents, First Steps really helped us to ease in to sending our child to infantcare. We didn't know what to expect, but the school was very hands-on and gave us a great helping hand in our child's development. They started the process of weaning her to solids, as well as monitoring when she became mobile enough to start playing with the older babies, subsequently moving her to a group where she could interact and play more with other children of the same age. The teachers were so kind and patient with her, and she enjoyed going to school every day... Absolutely no tears at the door! Sometimes she'd even just walk in by herself happily the moment check in is done!  Definitely recommend this school to anyone looking for a lovely place wjth wonderful teachers!, My 2 kids have been with First Steps over the span of 7 years in total. They have had the best memories in this school and they always come back home with stories of their teachers and friends and the fun they have. It is so heartening to know that the teachers have a part to play in their lives in inculcating good values from young. I like that their infantcare is pro breastfeeding, which just means mummies can bring their fresh stash of milk to the school everyday and the teachers will make an effort to keep the bottles clean and sanitized. The school will send regular updates about the kids and will provide a lot of support to the kids when they are unwell. The teachers and parents keep close in touch via WhatsApp and I feel this provides a good channel for feedback and sharing of each other‚Äôs lives. My kids tell me the food at First Steps is the best and they will look forward to lunch everyday.  Joy- Mummy of Leanne and Zevan, During our daughter's time in infant care, she received excellent care. The teachers and the principal were very hands-on, and we felt confident leaving our daughter in their capable hands. We highly recommend this place., Sended my kid since he was 2months old, teachers was caring and attentive towards even minor issues, they are not just like any other teachers,but they do shower alot of love to the kids., My 2 sons have been with First Steps (previously known as Zion Kids) since they were 2 months old, and the younger one just graduated this year.  Highly recommend First Steps (Depot Heights) so that parents can have peace of mind when working! Here are some of the things that I like about the school.  The school instils good values in their students and advocate a loving and nurturing environment which is important for the development of the kids.  The Principal and Teachers are very receptive to feedback and work closely with the parents. Teachers also provide regular updates on the kids.  The school is clean and it takes hygiene very seriously. Though there were a few cases of HFMD far and between, both my sons didn‚Äôt get it during their time at the school as the latter is efficient in disinfecting the school. Also, my younger son didn‚Äôt contract COVID in school though he had teacher and classmates who got it.  Academics wise, the school prepared them well for Primary 1.  My sons love their meals in school and would often go for second serving! üòä  I thank the school, principal and teachers for providing a wonderful environment for my sons during their stay in First Steps (Depot Heights)., To be honest, as a first time mum 5 years ago, I was only expecting the school to just feed and bath the kids, and perhaps monitor them as they play‚Ä¶. But no no no, I was all wrong! I am so impressed that their curriculum focuses on learning through play and themes, and what‚Äôs important is that they instil the right values through love, grace and kindness. Parents are also kept updated frequently via the WhatsApp group chat photos and announcements. I am extremely thankful to the teachers as they have significantly shaped Valerie to who she is today.  We recently also sent our son to the toddler class. Knowing and acknowledging that he‚Äôs a slow learner as compared to his sister, we didn‚Äôt expect much from the school... However, the teacher advised that we should start doing checks and enrol him in early intervention classes. After months of hospital visits, we realised that his problem is those huge ear waxes stuck in his ears! We got them removed and as of today, I am impressed to see how much my boy has progressed!  Our journey continues with them for the next few years and I really praise the lord for blessing us with such an awesome team of teachers from school.  My heartfelt appreciation to Zion Babies, Zion Kids, and now known as First Steps!"
First Steps Preschool @ East Coast,"The best infant care one could ask for :) teachers are very caring, there's constant communication with parents, conducive environment with plenty of activities. Very thankful for the teachers and the principals for taking such a great care of my daughter., The Teachers are very loving and patient. My heart is at ease when I leave my two girls there. The principal and the Teachers work as a team to take care of the children who are distressed because they are new to school and my girls are adjusting well! I also love their location. They often walk to East Coast Park with the children and have fun activities for them. Highly recommended!, When I was looking around for a child care Centre, I had a few expectations in mind. The teacher child ratio needs to be smaller, there should be outdoor activities and lastly, there should be constant communication between the teachers and myself. This school totally lived up to my expectations. The teachers were warm and friendly and my child adapted very quickly. The school is just by the beach so the children get to go to the beach often for sand play! They also have fun Friday every week where the children get to go for picnics, dress up as super heros etc. I love this school and I‚Äôm intending to enroll my younger one there ASAP., After seeing me carrying my grandson approaching the preschool,  the staff stood up and turned her back to us talking to another staff. We waited for her to press the open door button but waited fews minutes yet she just ignored us. As I still carrying my grandson  still crying, I knocked hard at the door. Then she pressed the open door button. She said that only can open door when kid is at the door. But we already at the door for few minutes and grandson crying loud, she can't hear  ? I think she purposely ignored us. Very bad working attitude., My 2 boys really enjoy going to Whizkid Preschool! They have a good teacher-child ratio.  Both my sons have grown so much because of the guidance given by excellent teachers! My boys will definitely miss Whizkid when they graduate. Thumbs up to Whizkid Preschool!, My child really enjoys going there which shows how they take care of him. Centre clean and safe. Teacher always informs me of whatever happens to my son., My daughter has found a place what she really needs. Very friendly, collaborative environment. Teachers are supportive., The center Teachers are very nice and friendly. The boy like the Teachers., A very nice and cosy environment for the children. Really like the fact that they bring the children to East Coast Park regularly., Fun loving experience school for kids to learn ü§ó ‚Ä¶, Very supportive & caring Teachers!, Small cozy school with caring teachers!, My friend's child has been studying in this school for several years. His Chinese listening, speaking, reading and writing have improved significantly, and he has become more and more polite in dealing with others! Thanks to the teachers for their teaching‚ù§Ô∏èüëç ‚Ä¶"
First Steps Preschool @ MacPherson,"I had my son enrolled in this school since they started with just less than 10 students and that was 3-4 years ago. The teachers were very good, caring and nurturing back then. The number of students with ratio to the compound size is also good. However, in the past 1-2 years, all the good teachers have left suddenly within a few months apart. The students increased drastically and the place suddenly became so crowded.  Eventually, we decided to withdraw my son out from the school even though he have established and made many friends. It is a hard decision but these are a few points that we have considered before withdrawing him  1. Poor updates from school (this only happens after the good teachers left) 2. Ever since the good teachers left, my son teachers keeps changing. I felt that this is not good for him as he have to keep adapting to the new teachers. 3. Not much activities being done, every day is just about tracing and practising writing which I think may be the easiest way for the school (just worksheets) but too much for the students. 4. Sometimes I waited 10 minutes just for someone to open the door to send my son into the school. Once I missed the smooth traffic hours, this could lead me to another 20-30 minutes for me to reach my office (often resulting in me being late for work, esp when I have meetings in the morning)  However, I want to give praise to my son Chinese teacher. She is one of the better teacher who did not leave the school. Even though she only taught my son for a year, I can see her genuine care and concern for him., Not sure why my review keeps getting removed from the page.  Below review by another parent is 100% accurate. Initially, I thought we were the only affected class. But it seems across the entire school, there are problems such as poor management, lack of teachers and poor updates.  Previously, school was fun and the kids looked forward to attending school. Things took a big turn once the good pioneer teachers left and the high turnover of teachers meant that the kids got to keep readjusting to new and random teachers - some eventually left too. Well, first hand witnessed how the school director/principal talked to the teachers and I can understand why some left. Seems like most teachers have to take multiple classes too due to lack of manpower and there are mainly Chinese teachers. Understand manpower crunch is a common issue in early childhood industry but this problem doesn‚Äôt seem to improve here.  School updates frequency was so bad. Sometimes if you don't ask, you get nothing. Once a week not too much to ask for right? Somemore some parents were promised two updates a week when they joined. What a lie.  Communication is poor as well. Most notable example, they boasted about a merger coming along, held a town hall and everything sounded exciting. Made parents go through revised administration processes and then out of nowhere said merger failed thereafter, way past the expected merger date. No accountability of how it would affect school and students.  School director/principal is unfriendly and have mood swings. Not sure if she applies the same attitude to the kids in school, especially when she is also one of the teachers. When she‚Äôs in good mood, she may smile at you if she sees you. Most days, she is sulky and treats you as invisible. A bit strange as she is supposed to be the leader and face of the school.  Some of the surviving teachers there are quite friendly. Just hope they are well taken care of. Location is also pretty convenient I guess.  School is open concept so it can be very chaotic and noisy but also may be fun for kids as they get to know people across levels and move around the compound. Depends on your preference.  @Don, perhaps it‚Äôs time you look into the operations of the school as it is currently not the standard it was when you first started this branch., Heard many good reviews about this school. Nice layout and environment. Very spacious and cosy. A handful of teachers who really enjoy working with children. The centre is also close to my home as well. However, had to withdraw my child from the place due to unforseen circumstances from both sides. Major factor being the vice principal suggesting that I look for another school for my son as he is not adjusting well with the school environment. Requested a testimonial out of goodwill and also for new school hunting but what was written on the testimonial was worst than a rude shock. School mentioned that my son misbehaved a number of times and even threw chairs. However, none of the claims were raised to us during pick up/drop off or even via text or call. I wish they had more frequent updates on their portal, a better understanding of their curriculum setting and a much better approach towards parent-teacher discussion. Disappointed but i am glad we found a better school for my son., The school environment is pleasent and nice. My son love the indoor playground very much  :-). School teachers are nice and helpful, always updating on my son health conditions and status. Well organise on the fun events indoor and outdoor. I am really happy to put my son on this childcare., Regretted sending my child to this school. How the school manage their hygiene between babies are my greatest concern and worries. My baby got HFMD along with few other babies just after 2 weeks going in, missed school for another 1 week and did not receive any follow up text from school or teachers. üòï ‚Ä¶, Staff did not provide genuine update until the last day of school stating that my son hit his peers and throw chairs. This was not the case in his first few days in his current school. School supervisor is not friendly., My granddaughter is in First Steps Preschool @ Macpherson. She is happy going to school. I can tell that her teachers love her., Infant day care centre for babies from 2-18 months. #kallangpudding #jusinfants #babycentreinsg #macpherson #infantcare"
First Steps Preschool @ Sengkang,"I really like this school because 1) The staff and teachers are caring, attentive, cheerful and nurturing. They put in alot of effort on the children and give very detailed information about the kids and how they do in school in all aspects. 2) They have a curriculum that is well balanced. Fun and yet, academic enough to prepare the children for primary school 3) Kids are always happy in school. Not just my kids. 4) Area is big enough for indoor and outdoor play.  Kudos to the school for giving the children a fun and holistic environment!, I have no problem waking my son up to school every morning‚Ä¶ It‚Äôs easy to say that he loves his school, friends and teacher so much until can‚Äôt wait to see them. He has developed fundamental skills and academics very well over a year in school.  Thank you OFS for a fun and safe place for my boy to enjoy a happy preschool life., My son was in PG group and was always got bruise. The teacher have been keep on replacing . Not recommend., Very good condition, Good quality nice relatively small children there Read"
First Steps Preschool @ Yishun,"We recently shifted and saw the contrast between our current school and first steps. The main teachers here are generally kind and nurturing. We're utterly grateful to the P, Ms kelly and teachers such as Xiao Ru Laoshi and Ms Zahirah for their kindness and literally helping us raise our little one since he was an infant. Ease of communication and Prompt response via the diibear app. We definitely miss this school and need more caring teachers like the teachers mentioned here ü§ç, My child just started his PG, and so far teachers are nice. Just one thing too highlight, the classroom is extremely cold! They say the temp is 25-26 but I feels definitely lower than that! Everyday when we pick up our child he is like from a ice cave. Hand/ feet all ice-cold. I really hope if they can make the room a bit warm as it is the coldest childcare we have been visited., My boy has been a pretty difficult kid to take care of since he was 4mos mainly because of his poor appetite. Was very worried as a first time mum to be sending him to an infant care at such a tender age especially after hearing terrible stories about other infant care. However, am really grateful to the infant care teachers over at OFS. The teacher to infant ratio is low and they were so patient with his milk and meal feedings. He has been growing well under their care and will soon be going over to PG!, This is due to the major lack of communication from the k2 teacher and not updating the parent based on my personal experience.  She uses her own classroom strategies towards the student without informing or sharing with the parents. I have already highlighted about this to their mgmt. I am dissatisfied with the overall experience., I chose this preschool over Little Petals and Picket Fence mainly because of their teachers. 3 teachers to 8 kids for N1 right now.  All their fees are comparable but taking in account that OFS actually includes both KinderMusik and Phonics in their fee, it makes OFS to be more worth it.  Plus, other than the ECDA subsidy, they are offering me additional $100 off this month. Really worth the money!, Our kids are happy with their teacher and friends here. That is the most important to us as a parent., More than happy to see my son happy. Special thanks to Teacher Idah for her hard work., No complaints. No regret for choosing OFS to be the very first school for the kiddos, Miss Lim is patience n attentive. I glad my boy like him., I love Chen Laoshi.üòÉ ‚Ä¶"

Kudos to principal Adeline and her group of teachers who does a wonderful job well done!, The teachers are kind and patients.

The kids will easy understand the festival for hand in doing dumpling, moon cake and etc. My child like to go school, and like the teachers. When we have any enquiry, the teachers will reply immediately and responsible.  Appreciate teachers' guidance and caring for the kids., My boy loved going to school everyday. I can tell he is very happy and the teachers care for him. He often comes home and talk about Teacher Sock Lan and See Yi ËÄÅÂ∏à. Can see the teachers are all very dedicated and going the extra mile. Really appreciate the guidance. Very good school and teachers. Highly recommended child care centre., Teachers are patient and very professional in handling the kids.

Teachers, manager, principal are genuinely caring and always keep us informed of her wellbeing in school. Thanks to the Global Tots EastGate team, and welll done!, My little one has been attending infant care at Global Tots Eastgate for almost 5 months.

Highly recommend for any parent seeking top-notch care for their infant., Finding a good school for your child is no easy feat, so we did a lot of research, toured many facilities and eventually chose Global Tots Eastgate. Our daughter has been enrolled at the school since late 2022 and we have seen her grow and develop over this time. The teachers at Global Tots are very welcoming and friendly, and they make an effort to share updates and photos via the app. There is a lovely parent community and the non-teaching staff (principal, manager and aunties) are all very helpful. Whilst there is no outdoor space, they have a great indoor gym and play area, as well as different spaces for the children to explore, learn and eat in throughout the day (e.g., they all dine together in one room for lunch and afternoon tea). If you‚Äôre looking for a school, we‚Äôd recommend you get in touch with the team at Global Tots!, Our baby really loves Global Tots, and so do we! Teachers Ashley, Yanice, manager Lynda, principal Tracy and the staff are an outstanding team that we truly appreciate they've been so forthcoming with feedback.

Overall, Globaltots has been a good choice., Finding a school for your young ones can be very worrying especially when they are still an infant. But all doubts were being cast aside when we did the school tour.

It certainly helps him socially being exposed to the multiple teachers there. Great and attentive teachers too!, Global Tots Eastgate has been wonderful to my daughter who just graduated from Infant Care since joining at 6 months old. The principal, teachers, and staff have been absolutely kind, nurturing - superstars in their own right., My son just ‚Äúgraduated‚Äù from the infant care. He really enjoyed it!

May God bless this centre and bless more and more children and their families through Glory Joy child development centre., My daughter love to go to school . Principal & Teacher are very nice and regularly interactive with us for children's progress and daily activities and learning path by phone.

My son is healthier now as compare before, he is a picky eater and now can eat some fruits and vegetables, he likes the food in school and learned to feed by himself.

The meal that the school provides was healthy.  üòä ‚Ä¶, It's super careless and loveless childcare, when my son newly joined, his hand got hurt by the teacher and yet teacher find an excuse that she only pull my son softly and so on. Second thing is my son got bullied by his friend but the teacher never ask both the parties to understand the situation, directly said to me that my son was naughty. I have complained many times., Teachers frequently update on how my kids do in school. Lots of communication between parent and teacher. It is non air conditioned as well and I feel that it is better for preventing cross infection of viruses., My son likes going to school... The teachers are very kind, patient and responsible.

Grace Child Development Centre,"Reason: Arbitrary rules by this school. Dont allow both parents to have a school visit to decide (even they disallowed 1 parent come another day).  Arbitrary rules for mask: Even after there being no mask mandates by govt, the school force us to wear mask when we went to visit. (While Principal and some teachers were not wearing)  Principal doesn't even spare 2 mins of time to discuss or talk with us when we visit to decide for admission.And she is not teaching or attending any other person. Shows how much they care. Zero.  Unhealthy air. Its enclosed space with continuous room freshner running and emitting chemical toxins in air. Was hard to stand for 5 mins at the reception. Wonder how it effects children studying there.  Overall the place seems unwelcoming and not a nurturing environment for toddlers or young kids., Not enough teachers for ar least 10 months and yet class strength is so full. P is unable to retain teachers nor hire good teachers. School curriculum is weak. Mainly let the kids do simple art and go for playground within the building. PArents have to pay for enrichment classes during school curriculum time."
Greenery Childcare Centre,"Excellent School environment. Though is without Aircon, I find it a plus point for open air where kids will not fall sick that easily and kids get to sweat out. I like the arrangement with free time where different age group gets to interact with one another.  Excellent Teachers & principal are very kind, friendly, patient and fun which makes children love going school. They are also attentive like food allergy, oral medication and skin medication.  Fun activities! Lots of activities where kids can explore their creativity. School is very active on the updates in terms of phone apps and face to face. Food is good and healthy.  Personally feel that my daughter enjoy the school activities and teachers. Highly recommended!, My children run to school excitedly every morning - That says it all about how much they like the environment and teachers there!  For us, it is important that the children learn life skills and habits such as responsibility and respect, exploration and discipline, and I do think these are well inculcated in my children with the guidance of Greenery! Thank you!, Caring teachers. Lessons are taught with hands on experience. Outdoor activities were also part of curriculum.  Arts, music were taught too. A preschool that teaches values to children. :), My child had development holistically ever since she was a year old with the school. Highly recommended if you want flexibility and dedicated teachers educating your child. They will be in good hands. üëç ‚Ä¶, This child care is good and have all professional teaching method. If have anything unknown issue can look for them, They are willing to take time to explain. The principal and the teacher there are friendly., Greenery is a good childcare and with good teachers. Both my kids love it., my kids has had a great experience at Greenery with the caring and helpful teachers. My kids has been attending for over 5 year now, and I couldn't be happier with the care they received.  Greenery is always make sure the centre clean and well-maintained, and I appreciate the emphasis they place on safety. The outdoor play area is spacious and equipped with age-appropriate toys and equipment. Although the centre is not air-con, but the good thing is the air flow is great and kids are not so prone to disease spreading in the air.  My kids has formed strong bonds with the teachers. Greenery also provide additional curriculum such as language and technology classes to allow children to be well-rounded.  Communication with the staff has been excellent. I appreciate the regular updates I receive about my kids day, including what they ate, how long they napped, and any notable milestones they reached. It gives me peace of mind knowing that they are in good hands.  In terms of flexibility, Greenery has been incredibly accommodating. They understand the challenges of modern parenting and work with families to find schedules that suit their needs.  Overall, I wholeheartedly recommend Greenery to any parent looking for a safe, nurturing, and stimulating environment for their child. It's been a wonderful experience for our family, and I'm grateful for the positive impact it's had on my kids development., My son is going to Greenery Child care centre for the past two years, staffs are kind and friendly. Personally I could see a lot of progress in my son‚Äôs interpersonal skills and he loves going to child care everyday. Great place and well maintained!, My children attend Greenery Childcare. The school has plenty of meaningful activities to develop the children holistically. Both my children enjoy attending the school. The teachers are also kind and caring. Thank you Greenery!, The principal and teachers care very much about the students and actively organize various colorful learning activities. With rich experience and high-level educational backgrounds, the teachers not only assigned dictation tasks to the children to improve their cognitive abilities, but also organized outdoor activities and carefully planned graduation ceremonies. Greenery Childcare Center definitely deserves praise and recommendations."
Greenland Childcare @ Fernvale Pte Ltd,"Teachers are patient, caring and attentive to students needs. My daughter had been well taken care of for the past 3 years. Many thanks to all staffs from Greenland Fernvale., My child has been in this cc for 4 years..their education, academy, teaching all not in my worry. Very pleasure with the teachers. Very thankful to teacher Mae and Lei Lao Shi for all these years their caring towards all the kids.sweet and sour to bid goodbye. Thank you so much., Both my boys studied and graduated from Greenland Fernvale and my younger one is this year 2023 K2 graduate. Indeed, he only joined the school in K1 while most of his classmates started since nursery/infant. I still rmb he was a crying clingy child when he first joined. But I am so blessed to have his K1 and K2 class teachers- Teacher Mae and Lei Laoshi.  They always gave my boy big hugs, encouragement and even told him/ other kids in his class that can treat them as mummy/ daddy in school which let him felt more secured and loved. They literally treat their class students as their own kids. Other than comforted my boy, they also comforted me by kept me updated on his progress in school and gave me confidence that he was coping well in school.  At the beginning, I was worried about his speaking and social skills, but few months later he just improved dramatically and in latest PTC, teachers even mentioned he sometimes talked too much to his friends..opps..haha.  Throughout these 2 years, the school/ teachers arranged a lot of different activities both inside and outside school and he learned both academic and non academic knowledge which can really lessen my stress to prepare him to go to primary school. What I liked most is the school atmosphere so homely that made my boy felt secured and safe and so could express himself freely which I believed is the key factor for a kid to enjoy learning at this age with a peace of mind.  I would like to take this opportunity to special thanks to all teachers/staffs who taught and took care my boys in this school. Highly appreciated your effort, love and care to my little ones., Teachers from Greenland childcare at Fernvale go above and beyond to create memorable experiences for my son, nurturing their minds and hearts with genuine care.  I still remember the first day of my son joining the school, at his age of 3 who faced separation anxiety, it was normal phase also it wasn't easy, but with the help of our amazing teachers, he blossomed into a confident and excited child, eager to go to school every after the day.  Once my son told me this- Teacher Mae mentioned to him: ‚ÄúIf you miss your mommy and daddy, you wish to hug them, hug me. Teachers Mae and LeiLaoShi are you mommy and daddy in school.‚Äù This was truly assuring words to him, and I felt the teachers empathy the inner of every child. Since then, i knew my son would in good handsü™Ñ  Beside, they organising and engaging events to involve parents in my son preschool journey, they leave no stone unturned in ensuring a holistic education for every child.  Teachers are true superheroes, pouring their hearts into every lesson and activity. They creating a safe and supportive environment where they can thrive.  üíöBecause of these amazing educators, my son happily looks forward to going to school every day and returns home with a smile on his face, humming rhythmic and dancing steps he learnt at preschool.  Today, my son is graduating from their center, specially thankful to year 2023 K2 teachers in-charge Teacher Mae and LeiLaoShi (Teacher Lei). Their dedication is truly inspiring! My som and children from the same class love them very very much. I am really fortunate i to have them.  Nevertheless, thankful to Ms Corinne who gave me courage and trust during the registration back in year 2019, and the center principal Ms Puva., This sch deserves more than 5 stars! Both my kids, one is 6 and the other is 3 are enrolled in this centre. Trust the teachers here and place your kids with no worries! My girl started out as a timid, shy and emotional child who cried ovwe everything. But 4yrs down the road, she has blossomed into someone who speaks with confidence, friendly twds everyone and even manages her emotions well. She is able to read and write both english and chinese and this is No credit to myself because I'm a hands off mummy once I pick her up from sch. She will even share with me on what she and her teachers will chat about, and even requested to be the last to be picked up from the centre.  Ask any of her classmates and I'm confident that they have their own testimonials of their child's breakthrus too!  My son did have a change in teachers this year but he impressed me with how he is able to express his feelings by telling me when he is happy and when he is sad or angry. And he can come home singing songs he learnt from sch, showed me some dance steps he learnt and request to make cards for his teachers. Most of his classmatez started out as a baby in infant care and if the centre had issues, I'm sure they wldnt have continued with pg and now, PN.  One of my concerns when selecting a cc back then was also hygiene. But greenland has one of the lowest hfmd and covid cases in this area. How would I know? Because my neighbours wld share updates from their sch and no immediate action was taken from the centre  even when they had rising cases of hfmd.  This centre has a very holistic curriculum that you don't see in some other schs. Outdoor programme includes gardening and exploring the types of insects you can find at the garden too. If you still have your doubts, just approach any parent who has their kids hanging around at the playground and I'm pretty sure they have ntg but gd reviews of the teachers and principal too!, All my kids attended childcare in Greenland. We have very good experience since the beginning up till today.  A good center for kids to learn and progress swiftly to P1., My son is very happy in school, both his teachers always talks to me about his progress ‚ù§Ô∏è Initially, he didn't talk so much, but now he talks alot. I love that he enjoys going to school and always talks about it. Thank you to the teachers in Greenland for taking care of my child. üòäüòäüòä, Parents should just keep an eye if your kids go to this childcare, and should always check with your kids if they everyday cry say dont want to go school. This is definitely a red flag! My daughter went to this childcare few months ago, and this is her first time attending childcare, so definitely would take time for her to adapt to the new environment, but the teacher in pre-nursery group especially teacher pamela is very impatient and not caring towards the kids, whenever she will cry she will bring her to the side and firmly hold her hands and beat her leg when she cannot stop crying. Although the teacher said she didn't do that, but i choose to trust what my daughter said as a 3 yr old kid won't lie, adults will lie.  Because of this impatient and unprofessional teacher, my daughter was so traumatized everyday before go to school previously, and will cry whenever i say ""school"" this term at home.  Luckily i managed to transfer her to another school and everything changed thereafter! The teachers in the new school are very caring and patient, my daughter only cry the first day and never cry again in the school. Teachers are very important, they are the role model for the kids as well.  Management should pay attention on the staff training, and don't let the black sheep ruin the whole school., Very poor Management. Have to submit my son's particulars for 3 times. The centre keep asking for the same documents. Clearly no proper communication between staff.  N1 teachers are impatient and not caring,  only like to ""wayang"" in front of parents. My daughter keep crying don't want to go school and say the teachers beat her. 3yo kid won't lie, I choose to believe her.  When my wife asked the principal to check CCTV, was told that it is not recording. Wth?  N1 teacher even complain our daughter after her first day, say we as parents must teach this teach that at home. Hello? You expect a 3yo kid listen to you during first day? Please be patient when taking care of young kids. Don't think you are suitable as a teacher.  My advice, please do not consider this centre! Myfirstskool or Sparkletots will be much better than you thought.  My daughter settled down in other childcare centre and everyday going to school so happily!, My love one Alicia love going to school after switching from PCF. Thank you puva and teacher Ian., Teachers were friendly and professional. My kids are very close with he's Teacher. Everytime he would come home and share what's happening in school. What he learned, what he played and some of he's routine. Overall my kids is happy and I'm glad., Please don't sent your child to Greenland Childcare @ Fernvale There is a hygiene problem, the teachers is not caring, keep shouting to the baby & children. The teachers is not Professional. Terrible!!!, Teachers are friendly, and the clan and educational environment. My child enjoy the school., Good teachers and curriculum, Professional & caring teachers and the environment is clean. Very nice childcare center., Thank you teacher puva., Thank you teacher Julie, Thank Ms.Corrine, Friendly teather, Friendly teachers, Personally, I feel that the teachers in this school are very professional and kind. The children still like to go to school. I also found that the children's Chinese language skills have improved a lot."
Greenland Childcare @ Sumang Walk Pte Ltd,"Really need to share here. Greenland is an Awesome preschool!!!  I shifted to Punggol since 2018 and there's only 3 preschool here. I registered both EB and MW as they are the nearest, waited for 3yrs and i decided to go Greenland because finally they have slot. I am so glad i did not get into other preschool earlier even though that caused my kid starts late, at N2. I always think those popular/ expensive childcare will be best for kids but i am wrong. What I heard from mommies friend was they don't teach so much. Most of the time its really ""child care"" playing. But here in Greenland they TEACH. Focusing more on academics which is the most important, a good foundation before then move on to primary school. Not only mine, kids in Greenland are brave, independent, read well, caring, smiley, happy.  They started spelling in K1, from 5 words to 10. Both English and Chinese. (My daughter just started her P1 now and she told me her spelling in what she had in K1... So easy) i have no worries on that. And she is able to count and pay for her meals in primary school. Which a huge relief for us as parents. We do not have to do much. Greenland do everything and get them well prepared for primary school life.  During school holidays, they even have theme event for learning, field trip learning, phonics rocketeer holiday workshop etc. comparing to other childcare centre i heard (even from the teacher) they did not have such arrangements and said that's too troublesome. So i asked them what they usually do during holidays? They said just go school eat nap and play toys. I couldn't imagine that.  Recently MK open for registration for my youngest one. But i do not wish her to leave and change a new environment. Because she is so happy with the friends and teachers there in Greenland. I'm glad my elder graduated from Greenland. She became cheerful, smart, caring, helpful.  And during her graduation last year, Greenland Sumang walk combined with Punggol drive branch. I was surprised! Both the kids from Sumang walk and Punggol drive can do very well speech and best performance i ever seen. Really a big surprise to all parents. We watch them growing well under Greenland's care. Is the best choices I've made.  So happy my youngest child still have another 3 joyful years learning in Greenland before she graduate. Everyday just so happy to see my kids go to the school with big smile.  Sincerely appreciate their hard work. Principal, Teachers and admin in Greenland Childcare Sumang walk always sweet and caring.  Thank you Greenland ‚ù§Ô∏è, BE WARNED, PARENTS! Most of the reviewers here gave 5 stars to all their branches, go figure. Next, you can read my experience.  During their open house, we were promised that our kid could start playgroup with them in November 2023. We believed them and enrolled with deposit. We waited for few weeks, during which even rejected school nearer to our place.  Recently, we felt the need to confirm our admission because Greenland kept silence all this time, but was told November isn't possible, must wait for Jan next year because ""that open house was for Jan"". Their only solution for not being able to keep their words was for us to enrol into the new school first then transfer to Greenland in Jan (I applaud them!). Of course, according to their policy we can't get the deposit back, even if they tricked us in the first place. No apology whatsoever, as if this is really just our problem and our decision to make. It's dishonest and disgusting. Honestly, I don't feel OK to leave my kid with them any more."
GREENLAND CHILDCARE @ YISHUN,"Thank you teacher Verity, Good"
GUG Preschool @ Thomson,"All my four children grew up with GUG which is a testimony of the faith I have in the GUG curriculum. Darrel, my youngest child, is in K2 and like all his siblings, love the school. Teachers are caring and encouraging. They know the children well. Through the curriculum, Darrel is able to read well, has an inquisitive mind and is a confident communicator. He is also taught to respect and be kind to others. I am happy with his development. I see consistency in the high quality of the school experience as observed in the positive behavioural traits and academic achievement in all my four children.  Thank you GUG!, As an educator in this school, I have always believed that GUG's phonics program is a very captivating and lively segment of the curriculum I like the best. I have taught children myself and have seen tremendous literacy skills and language among students. I am waiting for my child to be enrolled in PG soon. I believe in this curriculum as I have been with GUG for 7 years. Their curriculum is rich in hands-on experience. The children get to understand concepts greatly as they explore., My daughter has been with GUG Thomson since she was 18 months old. Within a few months, she has grown to be confident, independent and vocal. She looks forward to go to school everyday and enjoys every segment of the programme. GUG has a solid curriculum which allows children to develop at a pace that is comfortable for them yet in a fun way. The teachers are confident and caring in their approach in educating the children. As a parent and fellow Early Childhood Educator, I feel at ease to place my daughter at GUG Thomson., My husband and I highly recommend GUG Thomson as the desired preschool of choice. The GUG curriculum is excellent, and is more importantly brought to life by a group of dedicated and committed teachers. Both our girls benefitted from the GUG curriculum since they were 2 years old. Besides their famous phonics and literacy program as the backbone, GUG's structured program also exposes children to Mandarin, Math and Science concepts through experimental and experiential learning, and even covers general knowledge, social studies and recently robotics!  Based on our elder daughter's experience, we know that graduates of GUG are more than school-ready for Primary 1. She was always commenting that her P1 English and Mandarin spelling lists were ""nothing new and I have already learnt them at GUG"". She is in upper primary now and still speaks fondly of her time at GUG.  As our younger daughter graduates from GUG at the end of this year and transitions into P1, we are assured that she, too, will be able to cope with the academic transition and continue to display the positive social and moral values that the teachers at GUG Thomson have instilled in her. :D, Searching a school was painful as we were frequently blinded with great PR (great words, glossy pictures, sweet mission statements, etc.) ... but like most bubbles, they pop at first contact (visits). GuG satisfied my search academically, Teacher/pupil ratio, safety, security but MOST IMPORTANTLY in the ""human touch"" required for the very young. My son excelled in reading, writing, self-confidence, socializing, teamwork, self management, communication, etc. since he joined early this year (sweet surprise when he wrote several instructional booklets). Yes every child is different, and I'm happy to say that GuG's staff had a positive impact on my boy. Do come and make-up your own mind, as i'm 100% satisfied ;-), My son started N1 in February and has shown tremendous progress ever since. GUG is equipped with enthusiastic, well-informed and highly professional educators. We are happy with the efficiency and prompt communication we received via the school's app. Highly recommendable and definitely a place where children can thrive!, My son enrolled in the school since August last year and we can see his growth in terms of language and also his love of art work!  We get daily updates on his meals and activities through the app and it‚Äôs all done very professionally. As a first time parent, I feel at ease to entrust my son in GUG Thomson., I have a total of four children. Out of all the preschools my children have attended, GUG Thomson has been the best.  My son, Matthias, first attended the GUG weekend program since he was 18 months old. He enjoyed the lessons and had fond memories of the teachers who taught him.  Believing and trusting that GUG Thomson could bring out the best in my child, I then enrolled him full-time from K1 onwards. My decision is the right one: GUG Thomson's teachers and curriculum are truly brilliant!  What makes GUG Thomson stand out from other preschools is their dedicated team of teachers, who are skilled in delivering their teaching and are passionate about the children's development.  GUG‚Äôs curriculum is also impressive. Being an educator myself, I am pleased with what GUG Thomson has to offer. The curriculum has been designed to be well-paced and structured to develop a child‚Äôs holistic growth. Through the program, he learnt key fundamentals like phonics, English creative writing, Mandarin - new vocabulary words and Han Yu Pin Yin, Mathematical concepts and solving simple word problems relating to real life experiences, exploring Science, social  skills, values and much more, as well as growing to become independent, confident and curious about learning.  Most important of all, Matthias enjoys GUG Thomson and looks forward to school everyday. A child's happiness is fundamental ‚Äî in GUG Thomson, my child is happy.  Catherine Ong Matthias' Mother (K2 Brave Bear, 2020)"
Happy Family Edu-Hub Pte Ltd,"Better do not enrol your kids into this cc, the quality of food given and caregive totally not up to standards. If a kid were to fall, no records were to be written or taken note, instead the cc calls to ask you. And at ifc,same type of porridge were given every single day without fail, fish porridge. If your kid were to vomit, they sometimes do not know at all. Most importantly,with HFMD, they do not make official statement ,and what procedures they are gonna do. Instead the principal just whatsapp to inform thats all., Such childcare, with no activities given not up to date software unlike other childcare wheres every week updates of kids activities. Or even upcoming mother days activities also not teached to the kids. Like simple drawing or photo taking or anything else. Yet school fees were higher then others care centre, uniform also so much higher then other care centre. Even way before in the infant-care when wanna pick up my kid even can see the teacher sleep while sitting down. ?"

Now he is in N2 and has also learned some mandarin words, which surprise us everytime. The teachers and staff in this centre are all professionals, friendly and accomodating. They are always willing to listen to our concerns and requests. We are happy and thankful that we have found this centre for our child., I was in this School and it's the best :D"
Hope Childcare Centre,"Hope Childcare staff are professional, warm and sincere. We are truly blessed to be able to have our son in their care while we work. Our son has become more vocal and have been consistently able to speak in complex sentence structures after attending school. We are happy to see our son grow together with Hope and would definitely recommend this center to any parents., Convenient location, teachers are nice and the facilities are new. My elder child was here for 5 years, and now the younger continues to study here. Both of them really love the Hope Childcare, and me too! The food is freshly cooked in school and kids really love it. The curriculum is good also, and kids learn spelling (both English and Chinese) from K1. And they have a good foundation when they enter primary school!, We have been sending our children to school since 2020. They are very happy to be at school. They love the activities at school, and have been learning a lot from the wonderful teachers. Thank Hope Childcare Centre for providing a great environment for the children to grow up., I applaud the dedication devoted by the teaching staff and even the non-teaching staff. We are always kept abreast with regards to our son‚Äôs development as well as health and safety concerns. This all boils down to the leadership by the principal. Hope CC is relatively unknown compared to the popular centres but I have been very happy that my son is placed here. Even after we moved house, we still kept our son here even though now we have to take a bus., Hope Centre is a good environment for kids to learn. Teachers and Principal are doing well, they provide learning activities for children to learn and social as well. My child speaks, sing and dance too. Good job to the team of teachers., Our son has good experience with Hope Childcare. All teachers are friendly and try to help Children cope with environment. Thanks so much, My kids enjoy the school very much. Principal, teachers and non-teaching staff exert patience and concern towards students., Excellent team of teachers. helpers and principal."
House on The Hill Mount Sophia - Montessori Pre-School,"As a parent, I am extremely satisfied with our experience at HOTH Kindergarten. Since our daughter YiYi started attending, her progress and happiness have been evident. The teachers here are very professional and loving.  We moved to Singapore from China just over two months ago and were initially concerned about the challenge for our 4-year-old daughter to adapt to a completely new environment. To our surprise, YiYi adapted quickly within just over a week, largely thanks to the teachers‚Äô attentive care, The genuine smiles from the teachers greeting the children each morning are heartwarming. Particularly, Ms. Katrina. About three weeks into school, YiYi naturally ran to Ms. Katrina, showing a strong bond they had formed. As parents, we are thrilled to see our child grow in an environment filled with care and following the Montessori philosophy.  I highly recommend HOTH Kindergarten to families looking for high-quality early childhood education. A big thank you to all the staff at HOTH for providing such a wonderful and valuable learning experience for our child., We have been to 3 pre schools for our young one before Hoth. These schools includes boutique school, another large preschool franchise and another MMI type learning centre.  None could compare with the quality of mandarin lessons, physical learning environment as well as care from the teachers our young one receives from her time with Hoth.  She spent 2 years at Hoth and honestly enjoys her time at the school, having made ton of friends there. She looks forward to classes, meeting her school mates and teachers daily.  Her time at Hoth will definitely be a highlight of her preschool days!, We were specifically looking for a Montessori school and were not disappointed! House on the Hill made the transition seamless for us upon moving to Singapore. Aside from a fantastic menu, their facilities were incredible for a school situated in the city centre.  The classrooms were big, well ventilated, and had lots of light. Our child enjoyed being around the mix of kids from multi nationalities. We also appreciated that Chinese was present in the school environment as learning new languages is so important to us. By a month, our child was familiar with his classmates names, and was excited during drop-off., Our daughter attended House on the Hill for a little over 2 years throughout the pandemic and through the reopening in Singapore, from the age of 2 to 4. We were very happy with the quality and attentiveness of the teaching staff. The wide variety of activities provided our daughter with many interesting experiences and we would recommend the school. We're sad to say goodbye to HotH and the staff but we are moving overseas., Amazing Preschool with a dedicated team for the children. Our daughter started when she was 18 months and today is her last day of school, she is 5 years and a half. We would have loved her to complete fully her last year but we are moving back to France. Same for our son, he was supposed to start in December given how satisfied we were with the school ! It is always possible to exchange easily with the teachers, the director Marilyn (who is a crazy hard-worker for the kids), the team in general. Everybody is always very caring and the Montessori approach is crazy well respected. We can only wish a long life to House on the Hill as the school deserves it and we are very sad not completing the loop with you guys with our 2 kids. All the best to future students and to the that great dedicated team !!!, Caring and dedicated staff, in an amazingly beautiful facility, with lots of space, light filled rooms and in a historic building.  Great attention to detail in every aspect from curriculum to food served and each room of the entire building., Most fantastic teachers ever! They clearly care a lot for the kids, and are deeply committed to grow their skills. House on the hill will remain a very special souvenir of Singapore for us., Caring teachers who really love the kids. Our son enjoys school very much and we can see his holistic growth. He especially loves his mandarin class., Very poor experience in terms of interview processes. I was ghosted and received no updates from the school after 2 interviews, which is really unprofessional. The interviewers in the second interview also appeared judgemental during the interview. I wouldn't recommend people who have family commitments to apply for a job at this school. It probably won't be suitable for you. I've since received and accepted a more lucrative offer and felt I should post this up in case others waste the time I did. Oh, and they also photocopied my IC and documents and I hope that the school has discarded my information in accordance to the PDPA policy, since I was not hired. Wouldn't recommend this school., They are an excellent pre-school especially if you are looking for one with caring teachers that provides a good foundation for your child's learning., Nurturing mentors, I would want to work here."
House on the Hill Pasir Panjang - Montessori Pre-School,"Our child thoroughly enjoys the school! The teachers and staff are all very warm and caring too. In particular, their bespoke mandarin lessons are fun and focus on inculcating overall interest in the Chinese culture as well. Highly recommended!, Wonderful teachers, kind and positive environment, lovely parent community., Not good staff, Best school I have ever visited. 1. The school carefully prepared the open house, including snacks made by the school itself, and a Chinese class with the children. It is the only school I have visited that has prepared this way. 2. Great teachers, experienced, stable, and very patient with children. My daughter absolutely loves her teachers and enjoys going to school every day. 3. The school will share the latest curriculum content and children's activities in school in great detail, so that you can feel the children's growth. 4. There is a large outdoor lawn, independent classrooms, a low teacher-student ratio, and the staple food and snacks you eat every day are also very good. Compared with the same conditions, the tuition here is very cost-effective. Highly recommended."

Joyous Learning,"I recently enrolled my child, Zhang Ziyu in Joyous Learning Tuition Centre, and the results have been nothing short of impressive. The knowledgeable and dedicated instructors create a supportive learning environment, fostering academic growth. The personalized attention and well-structured curriculum have noticeably improved my child's understanding of challenging subjects. My child had been to quite a number of tuition centre but always wanted to come back to Joyous learning as she likes the teacher and the teaching method. I highly recommend Joyous Learning Tuition Centre for its excellent teaching methods and positive impact on students' academic achievements., First of all, I‚Äôd like to thank Mr. Sim with all my heart. Such an amazingly patient, knowledgeable, relax and calm teacher (that‚Äôs exactly what my daughter told me). She was in his GEP preparation class this year & thoroughly enjoyed his class. Mr. Sim will always make sure the kids understand all questions & concepts well before ending the class. My daughter has definitely benefited much from this programme as I can see her maths improve tremendously. Thank you Joyous Learning. Thank you Mr. Sim., Joyous Learning Centre has prepared my child well for the GEP.  Materials are interesting and organised.  Mr Sim has been very dedicated and patient.  He teaches with a heart and my child enjoys going for lessons every time.  He is always encouraging.  Thank you very much for your hard work in developing my child into a confident and capable kid. We are very blessed to have Mr Sim as our teacher.  Wishing you the very best!  May you enjoy many more good years of impacting young lives. :), Very dedicated and passion teacher. I feel so assured from Mrs Ang and Manager Irah . They both went extra miles too. Small class sizes. This is the best centre my kid ever attended. I would strongly recommend this learning centre., Highly recommended Joyous Learning! I was impressed by their materials and enrolled my son to P3 GEP class, didn‚Äôt expect him to pass GEP Test but to enrich with in-depth learning. Specially thanks to Mr. Sim for his patience and encouragement to kids, never give up nurturing the knowledge. We are blessed to be in his class..

Jovie Lee Si Yun St nicks ‚Ä¶, Marcus Goh's advance English lessons are really interesting and engaging. My kid keeps wanting to go back.

The quality of the teaching materials are good - challenging and relevant. The warm and cosy environment of the centre also creates a conducive learning environment for the kids. Most importantly, the teachers are committed a and sincere in their teaching.

Also really like that they take the trouble to give extra material to challenge the child when they can. My daughter really looks forward to her classes here! Highly recommended!, My son, Reagan is with Joyous Learning for Thinking Writer and Science. Having been with a few enrichment centres, he simply loves Joyous Learning.  Most importantly is that he has been enjoying the lessons very much from the start in Jan this year.The teachers are awesome and engaging and that contributed to Reagan's enthusiasm in attending the classes. They provide feedbacks to parents on child's learning and I am still monitoring his progress. My sincere thanks to the teachers!, My P3 son attended Joyous GEP class since the beginning of the year, and thus far it has been great. My son is the type that never likes school, or tuition, etc. But surprisingly he likes joyous classes. I think the lessons at joyous, as the name indicates, are truly joyous :) I'd recommend this center to other parents looking for a fun way of enrichment for their kids., I have been in Joyous Learning for 2 years, taking their Math, English and Science classes, and I am very thankful to Joyous Learning for helping me score AL 1 for Math, English and Science in the PSLE. Because of Joyous Learning, I can get into my dream secondary school. Thank you Joyous Learning. :), I enrolled my girl to Joyous Learning in early of this year. Actually my intention is not to push her into GEP. I wanted my girl to explore more and broaden her horizons, learn the different ways how to think instead of fixed ways taught at school. She was very excited to share with me the creative ways she learned with Mr Sim who was a very very kind, patient and humorous teacher with various techniques to get the students understand all those difficulties. I know my girl may not pass Run 1 or Run 2, but both my girl and I decided to continue the learning journey with Joyous Learning as the center is really focusing on inspiring and leading the child to think in creative multi-ways. We love Joyous learning. Thank you Mr Sim. We definitely love to recommend you and Joyous Learning to everyone., We picked Joyous mainly because we heard that Joyous Team was previously from a renowned tuition brand whereby GEP and PSLE results were record high. We heard good reviews about the teachers as well. They are indeed nurturing and above all, put in great effort in their teaching. My child looks forward going to his Science lessons every Wednesday night. All thanks to Mr Mag as my child comes home with full marks every time. Another plus point is that the class size is kept small to maximize student and teacher interaction. My 2-cents worth of suggestion to Joyous on registration fee waiver. .. Extend the waiver to all new P3 customers since they only start their intake level from P3. I am definitely a satisfied and happy customer :), My 8YO daughter attended a Math trial in December ‚Äò19 and she had a great learning experience! The small class size and cosy atmosphere are conducive for effective teacher-tutee engagement! The teacher - Mr Sim- was patient and knowledgeable. We stay a little far away but will definitely attend more fun holiday workshops!, My P4 girl had a awesome time attending the 3 days e-book story writing workshop recently.

This is the only few enrichment class which he shows so much interest., My son had an enjoyable and enriching experience for his one-off holiday workshop with Joyous Learning. He was talking non-stop about the workshop and had so many things to show and tell, especially on the remote control car he made. If not for the covid restrictions on classes, we would have enquired for more of such fun programmes during the school holidays. Thank you Joyous Learning! :), My Son is attending The Thinking Writer course and his compos are getting better and better every day, Thanks to the very experienced and patient teachers. I recommend Joyous Learning for other students striving towards excellence!, My daughter is taking English and Thinking Writer lessons (with Ms Seok Bee) at Joyous Learning. She has never liked writing compositions because she finds it boring to always write the same types of stories over and over. Somehow, the teacher manages to balance between letting my daughter be creative with her stories and keeping the compo exam-savvy. Definitely recommend their English programmes!, My son, Vijay attended Chess Workshop for intermediate players and he loved it! At the same time we found that the center offers various subjects like English, Math, Science and more. Therefore, we signed for English P6 PSLE preparation course. I always look at teachers quality, customer service and Joyous Learning has it all ! Highly recommend to other parents., My son J has been attending The Thinking Writer since January, and so far, he has found it very beneficial for his English composition writing.  For example, Ms Ong helps him understand where the potential errors are and how he can better improve the overall writing structure. It really does help create an optimal environment which improves his confidence in this subject.  Will definitely recommend it !, Dear Ms Stella,  I‚Äôm writing to thank you for teaching Kai Wen for past months . He scored full marks for his WA recently and has definitely gained more confidence in attempting science questions unlike in the past where he required much of my guidance . Recently most of his science questions he can handle them quite independently, and with much  confidence. I think he has attained a certain level of competence in mastering science concepts independently due to your teaching, patience  and guidance. I think you explain very clearly the concepts and application Questions.The questions set also help to extend his learning further. Once again thank you And kudos to you!  Dear Mr. Goh,  Kai Wen enjoys Mr Goh‚Äôs GEP lessons.. He is fun- loving and humorous and never fails to bring laughter to his class. He is also superb in explaining difficult vocab words and challenging comprehension questions are explained very clearly. My son has definitely learnt a lot and improved in his English and Math. Mr Goh really makes learning so enjoyable - indeed learning is ‚Äútruly joyous‚Äù at Joyous Learning üòÄüòÄüòÄ  Regards Kai Wen‚Äôs Parents, The lessons are fun, the teaches are the best and during break time, you get biscuits! The centre is also beside a skin care shop thingy, so while your kid goes for lesson at Joyous learning, you can go for an appointment and relax for 4 hours even though your kid's lesson is only 2 hours and your child starts crying and goes back into the centre for more biscuits! the next day, he had diarrhoea due to eating to mush Oreo, chocolate chip cookies and more biscuits! Come and apply for a lesson now! ( This review is just for fun, please do not be afraid of Joyous Learning it is actually safe and they certainly do not put anything in their biscuits, if you do not trust me, I ate their biscuits and I am not in hospital or on top of my toilet bowl), My daughter is loving her classes in Joyous.. Adrian is her favorite teacher üòä She says that he makes the learning very interesting..!Approach taught to tackle problem sums makes them very easy to solve. English lessons are equally informative n helps them with vocabulary a lot. Thanks, My girl joined GEP class towards the end of July, the teacher was helpful and patiently guide her. She achieved what she herself set as a target and see a marked improvement, especially in Math. We really appreciate the kindness of the teacher and friendly front desk staff., Joyous Learning is a gem in the field of education. The reasons are as follows: 1. As a boutique enrichment centre, the communication between centre and parents is top notched (for example, special schedule changes and reminders are sent in a timely fashion and this helps busy parents a great deal in the management of their children's extracurricular lessons). 2. There is a lot of ""heart"" in the modus operandi of the centre. Firstly, they do not pre-select students. I understand some centres conduct proficiency and aptitude tests prior to enrolling the students to ensure strong good results statistics. By not running pre-selection, Joyous Learning is a true educator at heart as every child is given the opportunity to be inspired to ignite their love for learning and hone their mastery in the various subjects. 3. The teaching materials are thoughtfully planned and designed to challenge the children and level up their proficiency in the respective subjects. 5. The teachers are dedicated and passionate about their craft. This is the game-changer that sets them apart. I will like to send a special shout-out to Mr. Marcus Goh. My child enjoys lessons tremendously at Joyous Learning under the fine tutelage of Mr. Goh. At the same time, he engages his students by creating a stress-less learning environment that encourages participation and the fun methodology applied creates a higher retention rate for the knowledge imparted. He has made a difference and made learning, for a lack of better word, joyful (and meaningful). 4. Value-added information is uploaded on their blog posts and newsletter on a very regular basis. This is a very altruistic act of sharing with keen learners who are unable to gain access to paid enrichment/tuition lessons. The side effect of being a student of Joyous Learning Centre is that regular school curriculum has become somewhat boring and unchallenging but that's a good issue to have, isn't it?  ;-) In summary, I highly recommend Joyous Learning as an enrichment centre., I'm not a Maths person, so I sent my girl here. I thought it would be all rote repetition and difficult questions, but actually her worksheets are quite interesting (when I looked at it). Her Mathematics improved by leaps and bounds and I'm rather impressed by how her teacher inspired her to love Mathematics and become a Mathematics Ninja (her words, not mine). Definitely going to try out the Science and English classes next, will report on it when I do!, A big thanks to Ms. Ong. She put a lot of effort in understanding my kid‚Äôs weakness and strength and helped him to develop his own writing style. With her guidance, my kid performed well for psle. She is patient and cares about her students. Look forward to seeing her again for secondary class! Also, many thanks for Irah for her admin assistance, She always goes extra miles for parents!, I've tried mathematics enrichment for my daughter at several centres. To me, mathematics is quite straightforward. Just drill all the way. So was pleasantly surprised by the small little things they do in class to make lessons more interesting. One activity I remember in particular was the forex exchange game they played in class when they were learning the topic of money. My girl was happy cos she exchanged the most amount of ""joyous dollars"" at the end. Haha!, I attend the upper secondary English classes and i have a jump from a C6 to a B4.  Throughout the lessons i have learnt comprehension answering  techniques and skills for writing a good  composition. I enjoy attending the classes with Mr Goh. He includes many life experiences with his other jobs like script writing.  All in all, I recommend other upper secondary students to come and join his classes, Joyous Learning is definitely the tuition centre to go to for PSLE prep with high quality teachers and curriculum. Due to a medical condition, my son was unable to attend school in P5 and P6 but wanted to give the PSLE a go although he only 6 months to prep in the midst of treatments. Weekly online tuition classes (from Apr to Sept 2020)  helped him to catch up with his ""lost time"" and also gave him the confidence to face the PSLE. The teaching methodology and materials are comprehensive and well paced to run up to PSLE. Eventually his results exceeded our expectations and he scored A* for both English and Science in this PSLE 2020 ( the subjects that he had tuition  with Joyous Learning). The centre manager Irah was also always very supportive and on stand during all the online lessons to assist my son. The Dean, Adrian, has a big heart and truly care of the kids beyond just teaching & academia. Thanks for everything! This centre is worthy of 5 stars and much more :), At first, I was skeptical that English tuition could really help me improve my English grades but after joining the secondary English class, I was surprised when my grades started improving gradually. The teacher, Mr Marcus Goh is not only dedicated in helping me develop my full potential, he also ensures that his lessons are always fun and engaging., My son is taking math at Joyous. He's already good at the basics, so what he finds really interesting are the fun activities they have every now and then to tie in with certain topics. I know he's mixed his own bandung, done some currency exchange and learnt some new system of mental calculations. Can see a lot of thought has gone into the curriculum., I had been in Joyous for 3 years, since Primary 4 to Primary 6. The subjects which I had taken there were English, Math and Science, all of which I had got A* for my PSLE. With my PSLE score, I managed to get into the IB track at St Joseph's Institution. Overall, the teachers at Joyous were really helpful and were also informative in the various subjects. Without them, I do not think I would have been able to complete my PSLE with such flying colour., I have just talked to Mr. Adrian Kuek about enrolling my son into his programme. He is a good communicator, dedicated teacher,  and definitely has vast experience in teaching students. He has more than 10 years of teaching GEP.  Glad to know him., I'm enrolled in Secondary English class at Joyous Learning. I like the class because the teacher is very friendly and open , furthermore I have learnt many English revision tips (like PEEL) that helped me during my exams . In addition , the teacher have gave us plenty of practices to do ., He enjoys the class and looking forward to every week lesson. Sometimes he will share what did he learn from the class. During school holiday, he requested to join chess training. After the training, he was so motivated and challenged every family member for chess., My daughter has been attending joyous science lessons. She looks forward to attending the lessons and is always very excited to share what she has learnt after the lesson. Great job! üëç ‚Ä¶, My daughter is motivated by the way of teaching by the teacher Mr.Marcus Goh and she likes to attend the class and learning the concepts with ease., I was shortlisted for the GEP test paper 2 when my mom signed me up for the GEP course . It was quite helpful and the teacher, Mr Goh taught me the methods of how to solve various types of questions. It helped abit in the real test but we have to see the results to really find out whether it helped or not‚Ä¶. But it was good üëçüèª ‚Ä¶, Well deserved full star rating.  My girl attended the Nov school holiday writing class for P3 which is a 4 days program.  The marked worksheets of dd's compo were with constructive feedback. I had a discussion with the teacher and she pinpointed dd's weak areas. The framework of this program is favorable for us. As we do not live around here and being unsure of dd's school schedule for 2019, J.L. will definitely be my consideration if schedules match with 2019 class timing. Thank you Mrs Ang!  Dd also enjoyed the one day Science holiday class. The approach for the answering technique is a great input. Will refer again once the term starts for 2019.  Had been following J.L. on Facebook before this program, and will continue to keep in touch with the programs offered., The Secondary english class is good. My son improved in his Compo and Summary and also said the teacher will show the real live examples of how english is used in advertisements and tv shows and newspapers., I join when it is all online classes and i thought my boy would complain. But he actually laugh and learn alot during the lesson. he said he wants to see the teacher and his classmates and go to the real class. Good lesson!s, Would like to sing praises to Mr Goh for motivating my child to have interest and passion to learn English and Mathematics and not forgetting to practice and revised after each classes.

We particularly like how well play is incorporated into the curriculum and isn't focused purely on academic progress. The school encourages kids to enjoy their childhood while learning through play., I happened to chance upon KW @ Cactus in search of a suitable childcare around my area last year. During the sch tour, I liked that the classrooms were spacious and clean and the school had its own outdoor play area. I was also keen on the KW‚Äôs curriculum and the low teacher to students ratio. The Principal Ms Tricia was very hands on. After enrolment, she and the teachers helped my girl to blend well into the new environment during the difficult times of separation anxiety, which I am really grateful.  One year on, my girl has grown to like going to school and makes friends in the class. Many thanks to the teachers at KW @ Cactus especially to the PG teachers - Teacher Grace, ÈÉ≠ËÄÅÂ∏à, Teacher Ivy for their care, guidance and patience, and also ÂàòËÄÅÂ∏à and Êù®ËÄÅÂ∏àwho had taught her. My girl loves Teacher Grace and likes to mimic her actions like teacher at home. There are weekly updates on kid‚Äôs progression and the communication is prompt. So much effort to make the lessons interesting and fun to engage the kids. How I wish I had such learning opportunity when I was her age! I would like to extend great thanks to all the staff from KW @ Cactus for the kindness and care given to my girl., We are so happy to have chanced upon Kiddiewinkies when looking for an infant care for our baby. We love that the Teachers and the principle are so caring and attentive, the place is also clean and hygienic. We are also updated regularly.

All the Teachers in the school are very dedicated and friendly, and I can tell they really care for the children. I can drop off my baby with any teacher and he will be happy to go off with them, and all the teachers are also very caring towards my baby.  On his first 2 days in school, he wasn‚Äôt used to the new environment and had trouble napping. His teacher Rachel actually carried and pat him to sleep in her arms the whole time.  Principal Tricia is also very patient with my enquiries as a first-time mum, always giving me prompt replies. Overall it‚Äôs very assuring to leave my boy in their care.  I like that they have different learning themes every week for my boy to explore & learn. I look forward to having him grow up and learn many new things with Kiddiwinkie!, Experienced, professional, dedicated and loving team of teachers and principal. My daughter goes to school in jovial and excited mood and is excited to see her classmates and teachers.  They pay attention to details and generous to provide updates of my child throughout the day. Communication is also easy and rapid.  Activities and programs are well designed and creative which I believe my kid enjoys. It brings a smile to my face when they share activities and milestones through the app.  It gives my wife and I the ultimate peace of mind and allows me to focus at work knowing my daughter is in good hands of this school., I would like to show my appreciation to the Teachers in playgroup of Kiddiewinkie @ Cactus. In particular Teacher Grace. Thank you for making school fun for Issac and letting us as parents to be able to put our mind at ease when we are at work.

We appreciate her constant feedback about Nat‚Äôs development and progress in school. Thank you for your patience and unconditional love for the child., A big thank you to all teachers and support team at Kiddiwinkie Cactus!  My son has been attending school at this centre since December 2018 and the teachers especially Teacher Christlyn, Tian Laoshi and Teacher Ivy from his PG class, as well as Principal Evonne and Teacher Zoe were extremely patient and caring to get him assimilated to the school environment.  I truly enjoyed my first 3 days of orientation with him although he was crying very badly due to the new environment and separation anxiety. Teacher Christlyn was very patient and experienced to try to get my son to nap in school on day 1 as I decided to start him on a full-day class right from the start. Over the initial days and weeks of the school, we get very regular updates from Teacher Christlyn, his form Teacher on how my son is adapting in school. Teacher Ivy and Tian Laoshi were also extremely patient in coaxing him whenever he cries or throws a tantrum.  School must have been amazing for my son as he stopped crying at morning drop-off 2 weeks after he started school which came as a big surprise to us. It just happened one fine day! As parents, we are very elated to see our son enjoying his school so much.  On 2 occasions when he had to miss school due to him being unwell and another for being suspected of HFMD, he seems restless and easily irritated at home (besides his possible discomfort). Nonetheless, we saw a sharp turn of his emotions on the night after he first returned back to school.  On a regular basis, we receive photo and video updates on his school activities which never fails to warm our heart, especially during a hard day at work. Thank you!  As a close-knitted team in school, we frequently see Teachers from other levels helping out in his PG class and during assembly. A big thank you to Principal Evonne's stewardship and the warmth we have been receiving from other teachers at Kiddiwinkie Cactus as well - Tr Ariel, Tr Linda, Liu Laoshi, Tr Crystal, Tr Elaine and many others whom I regularly smile and acknowledge to but not sure of their names., My daughter always says ""teacher Elaine is my friend."" ""I like teacher Elaine"". "" Am i going to teacher Elaine's class tomorrow?"" We thank teacher Elaine and other teachers for their patient to teach, guide my daughter and take care of her. We are glad to see that she is happy to go to preschool every day., A big thank you to the Kiddiwinkie teachers for being so nurturing. It is such a joy to see the teachers playing happily with the kids before assembly every morning. Special thanks to Teacher Crystal and ÂàòËÄÅÂ∏à for creating such a conducive environment for learning. Randall often comes home excitedly to tell me about the games he plays. And never would I have imagined him singing Chinese songs nonstop after school!, To Teacher Elaine and Teacher Crystal, I‚Äôm deeply grateful to have both of you contributing to my two boys growth and emotional well being. For your patience and passion. Thank you again for making me feel comfortable being away from my crying boys especially Kyan and for comforting him beyond expectations while I‚Äôm away. Lastly I wana express my sincere gratitude to all the Teachers and principal Evonne for all the love care and patience given to my both boys. Thank you!, Big thank you to all the teachers at Kiddiwinkie - especially the PG teachers like Teacher Christlyn, Tian Lao Shi and Teacher Ivy for taking care of my daughter and allowing her to enjoy school. It's amazing how all the teachers know all the students and I really like the close knitted culture of Kiddiwinkie. Happy teachers day!, I have put both my daughters at the school.  Besides the robust curriculum,  the teachers have exhibited professionalism coupled with compassion when necessary.  Parents are given constant updates regarding their child's progress in the school and focus a lot on preparing their young charges for primary one., My little one has been attending this pre-school for over 2 years now. Everyone running the school there from the principal, teachers and staff members are helpful and cordial which results in a loving and nurturing environment extremely important for kids spending most of their growing up years there., How time flies when the my two kids are enjoying their time at Kiddiwinkie, Cactus.. You can always feel they are looking forward to go school & that they enjoy their day at school via the check in & out pictures.. The teachers are close to each other & work closely to each other.. All Teachers seem to know & understand each kids needs & behaviour..  A special thank you to Teacher Ariel who has been teaching my elder girl in K2.. She focus quite a big portion on the right attitude & character building but not forgetting to impact the necessary studies & knowledge to her.. My girl has been exposed to current affairs (eg like the polar bear who passed away, monsoon, rain forest on fire).. when she came back & shared with us.. We are impressed & starts to think that we should expose her to read newspapers.. On TOP of that, for the reader program, I saw the effort of Teacher Ariel to expose her to different kind of books not merely just exposing her to reading..  Áî∞ËÄÅÂ∏à is also great as she knows my girl is weak in her Ê±âËØ≠ÊãºÈü≥, while the other kids are playing.. She spent her rest time to go through with my girl in order for her to be able to catch up in class..  Thank you Teacher Christlyn for making the starting so assuring for me too.. The pictures & videos are really appreciated until now.. It‚Äôs so precious moments..  I feel that all our concerns & worries are being heard by the Teachers.. Hence, we feel safe & happy to leave our kids in their good hands..  Please continue to shine & have passion in teaching as the kids really need this love from the Teachers in order to grow & become a better person..

Fortunately for us, there was a Kidz Meadow opening very near to our home in Bedok North so we enrolled him in the school and it was the best decision we made.  The principal and the teachers there are exceptional. You can tell that they really care about the children. They take them time to observe each individual student and work with the parents to help with the child's improvement.  I highly highly recommend this school. Very excellent place to develop children., Its been a wonderful 3yrs learning journey for Hans Li. He enjoys going to school everyday. He shared every single new things he learnt in school.

Thank you, KMBN, for giving my son the best early childhood experience!, We started putting our kids here because of convenience, and we like that fact that unlike many other preschools that are enclosed, in air con all day, this school is well-ventilated with its open windows.  The teachers and staff are generally friendly and take care of the kids well. I'm glad to see my kids (who are normally very reserved around strangers) learning new things and opening up to their friends and teachers.  Despite Chinese being our second language, we don't speak much of it at home so I'm especially appreciative of the Chinese teachers in the school for sparking their interests.

They always communicate and are transparent about everything. I was nervous at first but I am comfortable with their care now.

I can tell my daughter's teachers (Ms Jing and Cikgu Syikin) truly love her and take amazing care of her. When I say they are amazing she can literally stay wif them all day long, give big hugs and come back full of praises for them every single day! I think that speaks volumes of the care provided!!!

Kidz Meadow Childcare & Development Centre (Jurong West),"I had the privilege of witnessing incredible childcare teachers who made a lasting impact on both the children and the parents. Teacher Naz and Teacher Maria, dedicated and passionate educators, created an environment that fostered growth, learning, and happiness for every child under their care.  When my daughter first started in the childcare, she was a bit reserved and hesitant when it came to speaking. However, with the patient and nurturing approach of her teachers, I saw a noticeable transformation. The teachers created an environment where every word spoken was celebrated, and every effort was met with encouragement. This positive reinforcement worked wonders, as my child began to open up and engage more in conversations. Nowadays, I am happy to hear from my child about the activities she is doing in school.  It's wonderful to see my 2-year-old son has shown improvement since joining this childcare. Early childhood education plays a crucial role in a child's development, and it seems like my son has been benefiting from the nurturing environment provided by the school and the care and guidance of Teacher Naz., My son have been attending kidzmeadow for a few months now. I would greatly recommend the school.  #1. The teachers are caring and loving towards the kids. Its also good that some are firm too which I strongly feels the need to be too. #2. The centre windows and curtains is always up so we can peek into the classes. #3. They really pratice good hygiene so when the kids enter the premise they will straight go to the toilet to wash their hands before they start their day in school. #4. Thanks to Tr. Hairah who has always respond to my concerns and needs and I really appreciate it alot. üòÅ  I have seen alot of improved on how my son love to count as he walk.

From the moment he joined, I noticed a positive change in his development. The teachers at the center, especially Teacher Hairah, have played a significant role in his growth. He adores his teachers and has formed a special bond with Teacher Hairah, treating her like a friend. Their nurturing and supportive approach has helped him flourish. One remarkable transformation has been in his communication skills. Since joining the center, my son's ability to express himself has significantly improved.

Thank you for working so hard with my little ones and for being patient with them. ü•∞, My child has been in the centre since April 2023, and I‚Äôm here to leave Kidz Meadow Jurong West a well deserved 5 stars rating review and I‚Äôll share why. The centre has left a huge positive on child & family as a whole. They most definitely deserve the five stars. According to these 5 aspects:  1.	Communication -  My first communication was with the admin through a phone call, Ms Diana which is I felt that she was very knowledgeable in providing all sorts of information that I need or might need. She assisted in registering my child and the process was smooth sailing. Mdm Liyana, the principal was very warmth and welcoming during the school tour, assuring us first timer parents. She provided the necessary details through and through via their termly circular, monthly update every now and then updates which helps us working parents to stay on track. Channels such as phone call, emails and parent‚Äôs communication app were all active to stay communicated within one another.  2.	Environment ‚Äì The environment set up for the children are well planned out and engaging for children to stay attracted and interested. They keep up the standard of cleanliness and step up with necessary protocol in times of an outbreak which assured us parents that our child‚Äôs safety is not compromised at any point.  3.	Child‚Äôs progress & development ‚Äì Although my child has only been in the centre for 5 months and counting, I am happy that my child is progressing and hitting more milestones as an individual and socially. I am sold when I learnt that centre provides Malay language as a second language which is one of the top criteria when I planned to send my child. My child‚Äôs progress and development is always updated and areas to improve are always shared by the teachers so I know how else I can continue to support my child.  4.	Meaningful events ‚Äì KMJW always organised and planned meaningful events that involves the community, parents, staffs and children which I feel is really a wholesome experience to allow my child to be nurtured as an all rounded person. Events that we had seen and participated such as Hari Raya Celebration, CareerDay & Field Trip Excursion, Mother‚Äôs Day Celebration, Termly Disposition Day, Father‚Äôs Day Celebration, Fundraising Bazaar for Partidor, Parent-Child Workshop, Racial Harmony Day Celebration, National Day Celebration etc. I am very awe by the constant events & parental-involvement activities created on top of their daily routines and normal curriculum activities.  5.	Passionate & loving staffs ‚Äì I can never say enough thank you to all the KMJW staffs, especially my child‚Äôs current form teacher ‚Äì Teacher Hairah and alongside, Teacher Dilah, Teacher Seri & Teacher Tse Er who had been there for my child since her first day of school. The safety net and assurance that the teachers had built with my child had helped the transition of dropping off and picking up less stressful because the staffs really take note of what my child likes and dislikes. This goes to show the staffs in KMJW really take pride in their job to ensure bonds and rapport are build.  I am thankful that KMJW has always kept a standard that is beyond my expectation and in no doubt, if I ever have another child, I‚Äôll place them here <3, Would recommend Kidz Meadow as the teachers and Principal constantly provide updates of your child's curriculum. The thing I like about the school curriculum is they are focus more on nature thus my child really enjoys outdoor learning and really helps in learning through play., Thank you so much to Teacher Surita for guiding my daughter in her reading and be patient while teaching her. Thank you so much to Teacher Suhaila for always keep a lookout for my son. Always motivate him to do his best in everything. Thank you kidz Meadow Teachers for giving their best in teaching and patient with all the students., Where education meets fun.  Since my child started schooling here, he has been developing at a good rate. He is much knowledgeable at his age group. He has been alot independently doing things that he learned at school. He has postive feedback from school, like singing to the songs the school teachs, the activities that he do with the teachers and many others.  Much activities have been done by the school to foster parents child bonding, as well as child school bonding. Teachers are well liked by my child. Teachers took special attention to kid who are struggling either in activities or studies and render necessary aid to curb any sickness from spreading.  Kudos to all the teachers teaching there. Special mention to teachers teaching my kid in N2B.  Keep the spirit going!, Great teachers and staff with good learning environment for toddlers.

Kidz Meadow Childcare & Development Centre (Yew Tee),"My daughter was transferred from another school to Kidz meadow yew tee a few years ago because at her previous school she was made always sit at a corner because teachers said she's lazy to learn. When she entered kidz meadow yew tee, teacher suggested to bring her for check up and we found out she have dyslexia. Teachers at kidz meadow have very eyes for details. They don't straight away judge your child, they will find root cause and then get it treated from there. She have graduated and in primary 2 now. I have another son who's been with the school since he was 18 months and we all thought he was mute cause he was quiet all the time until he went kidz meadow and start singing nursery rhymes and talk alot. Time flies he's graduating soon. This year 2023 i enrol my 18 months son with medical history diagnosed. 2 school rejected him because they don't want to take risks and if I insisted to send my son to their school I must be with him at all times which I felt defeated the purpose of sending him to school. They also suggest me to send my son to special school at Awwa which I don't want because I want my son to feel that he's normal. Thank you kidz meadow yew tee for accepting my son and being a educator and 2and mom to my Children. I'm sure those who send their kids to kidz meadow will give the best review like me. Trusted preschool I must say Not forgetting the centre principal who always on the ground with the children unlike other preschool u can only see their principal sitting inside office no interaction with children.‚ù§Ô∏èüëçüèº‚≠ê, My Daughter has been attending Kidz Meadow since she was 18months old.

KMY's other activities such as nature magnified is great as it opens up their mind about our great mother nature. KMY also organised field trips to places of interest, so classroom learning is not just textbook based. They gave timely updates on my daughter's progress, be it formally through report card or photos of their activities. KMY also organised recycling activities, which bodes well with current environmental needs.

I made a wrong decision when I changed my 2nd, Mishary, and 3rd, Mahirah, child to a childcare nearer to home. They get sick often and do not see progress in my children's education, so they returned to KMY though its a little further from home. I see the positive difference in their characters and confidence. They are in better health condition. The teachers are well trained, patience and always update on my children's progress.

Kinderland Preschool (Marine Parade),"My son has been with Kinderland MP in infant care for a year now. All staff, in particular the infant care teachers, are extremely loving and patient with him. My son is always happy to go to school. Expecting my second child soon and will be sending him here also., The job done by the teachers, principals and all the employees, reflects a very high education and moral standard.  Kinderland left an impressive imprinting in Leonardo grow and formation both in academic / education and human terms. The amazing daily job made him a better person, boosting his personal skills and improving those  not yet developed:  The dialogue between teachers and parents has been always extremely helpful, going through a deep and surgical analysis of Leonardo behavior, attitude and further developments. Moreover Kinderland organization through its very capable staff delivered the most important thing in a child growth: pure love and devotion.  Thanks for everything You have done for Leonardo and all of us.  Stefano Romanelli, Lovely school with wonderful teachers. My daughter is constantly progressing and is always full of joy going to school. I can only thank all the teachers, vice principal and staff for their commitment and dedication., Teachers and staff from Kinderland Marine Parade have been the nicest to my boys over the last two years. Ms Ivy, Wang laoshi and Zhang laoshi from Infantcare, Miss Ying and Yu laoshi from pre-nursery class, and many other teachers who I didn't get to mention here, have been the greatest teachers for my kids. Not only they shower them with lots of love and care, they made the days on school full with fun and happiness. Bringing them to school is such a joy everyday. Although there are areas can be improved, the teachers there are superb!, Dear Ms Ying, Yu Laoshi, Ms Ivy , Zhang Laoshi , Wang Laoshi, Ms Gwen, Zhao Laosh, Ms Bernice and all the wonderful teachers from Kinderland @ Marine parade  I would like to thank each of you for taking great care of Zayden and always take the extra efforts to provide guidance and coax him on his bad days. Appreciate for your efforts in ensuring Zayden is under good care. I felt assured to leave him under your care and  this is the main reason that I choose not to transfer my son to a nearer centre despite the travelling distance from home or work place  The great team has created a warm and welcoming learning environment, which gives positive vibes to the children. The teachers are caring and always show their concern towards them.  Thank you for your continued love and patience towards the children. Thumb üëçüèª up!, As a father who has his child in preschool, I want to make this review to remind parents that after the viral video, Kinderland management has decided to bar teachers from using their mobile devices during work.  This initiative sounds to me like an effort to prevent whistleblowing. Rather than take responsibility for their lack of checks and balances, they prevented teachers from reporting abuse when they saw it in the future. Makes me wonder what happened to the whistleblower. Was she also removed for taking that video?, Sent my baby to infantcare from age 6-17months and my experience was pleasant. No issues with my deposit refund either (received the refund promptly within 2+ weeks after withdrawal date).  I received regular updates from the teachers during school pickups and my child always seemed happy and smiley. The teachers for infant class are generally caring and gentle. too There's also a wide variety of activities for the babies - art projects, sensory play/ exploration, story reading etc. I also appreciated how involved and caring the vice principal (Bernice) was.  I had to change childcare as we relocated, but I wouldn't mind recommending this outlet., My girl have been with MP kinderland. Very pleased with the school curriculum and teachers, Unfortunately, overall I did not have a good experience. Main things being that one day they gave me the wrong ‚Äúcaucasian‚Äù baby back, trying to convince me that this baby was mine. I found that not only racist but dangerous that they would hand me someone else‚Äôs baby. On Father‚Äôs Day, they had my child make a Father‚Äôs Day card, took photos of her and sent them to me, and my baby does not have a father, which they know. This is deeply upsetting. And finally. After giving 8 weeks notice to leave when only 4 is required, I am still chasing my deposit refund with a whole heap of excuses as to why the refund transfer hasn‚Äôt worked. I have given them multiple account methods to receive my 1 month‚Äôs deposit back and my messages get ignored. Empty promises to pay me back one day and then radio silence. The glimmer of light is the Deputy Principle. Lovely person. The principle however has very little presence. Maybe the deputy should become the principle., Great teachers who saw through the growth the development of both my kids. Highly recommend!, Very disappointed with the school management. I've placed a deposit with the school and was given registration fee waived due to my corporate deal. Due to personal reason, I informed 4mths in advance to withdraw the enrolment. However, I was told that the registration fee would be clawed back from my deposit, which was not what I understood from the staff who assisted me to do enrolment I'm glad I decided to terminate with the school and would warn other parents not to consider Kinderland as they have a poor management team, not to mention they've changed 2 principals since my first enquiry back in Sep'21 (within a year), Great school and responsible teachers with many activities specially curated for the children., Very happy to have my kids in Kinderland. A nice and conducive environment, It‚Äôs a wonderful place to learn and play, Attentive teachers and good learning program"
Kinderland Preschool (Ministry of Manpower),"Teachers are patient, caring and attentive to students needs. Principal is consistently setting up a good example as a leader to ensure smooth running of the entire school. My daughter had been well taken care of for the past 4 years. Many thanks to all staffs from Kinderland MOM., Well experienced teachers, nice principal and customer service. Good learning curriculum. My daughter has a lovely, memorable journey with Kinderland MOM since 2019 till K2 graduation this year. Thank you!, We first time came to here. This place is not so good and there is no food.

Special shoutout to Ms Michelle, Ms Lay Kwang, Lin Lao Shi, for taking care of my daughter who is graduating this year. The memories created are everlasting, we wish the school all the best !!!, Both my son and daughter were taught at Kinderland MOM. Both of them grew up with a good pre-school education, great values inculcated in them, and benefited from excellent care given by the staff, teachers, and principal. Both my wife and I trust Kinderland MOM - that is our experience., From the period of my daughter's playgroup to K1, now almost 5yo.  I've seen the lengths and love invested into the education and well-being of the children's in their care. The staffs are always positive, passionate and always ensure parents are updated and involved in their learning.

Kinderland Preschool (Ministry of National Development),"When searching for a school, I prioritize looking for a school with plenty of outdoor activities. Other key factors such as a supportive environment, providing phonic foundations, and musical development within the school curriculum are a huge plus. After visiting 4 different schools, we found The one. Kinderland@MND had it all. Best of all, it is strategically located in town. My girl started in the mid of Nursery in 2022, prior to that she was taken care of by her grandparents. Teachers and principal had helped her transit from home to full-day childcare extremely well. She was a shy girl prior to entering Kinderland. In just half a day of school, she transformed from a quiet child into a friendly confident one. She initiated hi and converse with my colleagues after school confidently.  Prior to entering Kinderland, my girl does not know how to read. Within a short 6 months, by December, she is able to read story books for her age, credits go to teacher Beatrice.  Now she‚Äôs in K1, she is able to read The Gingerbread Man storybook independently. I am extremely thankful to the teachers in school for her achievements, especially teacher Sally and Miss Sim. She does not sign up for any academic enrichment outside of school, her love for languages is natured during her stay in school. Teachers will regularly read story books and through activities impart knowledge through fun interactions. If safety is a factor for you, I will love to share that Kinderland@MND is located on a floor that is almost exclusively for the school. I love the fact that it had 2 layers of secured access prior to safety checks, and children will be guided into class by the teacher on duty.  As a mum with a girl, I really like the fact that the classes adopt an open concept because child abuse will be visible to other teachers which will keep the children safe. A point to note, at the moment the school does not have a male teacher. Which is another plus point for me.  I highly encourage parents to arrange a visit to the school to see it for themselves. The very key deciding factor is having a highly experienced and passionate principal leading the school. Principal Kelly shared her beliefs and vision for the school with me during our visit, and under her guidance, Kinderland@MND delivered above and beyond. She is very generous in sharing insight into children‚Äôs growth, exposure, and milestones with parents.  Behavior and guidance ‚Äì as a parent sending my child to a full-day childcare, I admit that I am dependent on her teachers to guide her in many aspects. I am very delighted to learn that teachers are firm, provide proper guidance when children misbehave, and provide feedback to parents so we can work hand in hand both at home and in school. If you are like me, you will appreciate having teachers bravely share weaknesses in your child so you can improve and support them efficiently. My child has grown to be a positive and encouraging child. She will stand up to state a point and also listen to others‚Äô opinions. Share the joins of others‚Äô success and self-encourage when faced with challenges. These are qualities she has picked up under the guidance of her loving teachers.  I am extremely thankful to all the teachers who guided my girl. She always looks forward to attending school., Son has been with them since he was 4months old. He is 6mo now. Nephew did infant care here too and he's 2yo soon.  Teachers, principal and admin are kind, responsive and responsible. Love seeing how kids wanna keep playing at playground and not leave after. Most kids seem generally happy to check in every morning too. My nephew loves going to school and the activities he participates in when there too. My Son was only in school a week when he started trying to chat and smile with his teacher when we collected him. He was 4months and a week old only then.  Am grateful for their support and dedication. Giving us peace of mind as we work. thank you Kelly and Team., I‚Äôve been sending my firstborn to kinderland since he was an infant and he absolutely loves the school! The teachers are very passionate and truly care for the children and principal Kelly ensures that everything is in order so that the teachers can concentrate on teaching and playing with the children!, Teachers are nice. However, Admin is TERRIBLE! My child left the school more than 3 months ago and still have not received the refund for the deposit!!! I have contacted them many times and every time their reply is "" we will get back to you"" which they never did with any updates., My kid has been with KES since infant care days and I am so glad that we started her school-going journey with KES-MND. Even though it‚Äôs a distance to get there daily, my kid loves going to school everyday to see her teachers and always wanted to play longer in school when I pick her up. I saw how much she has grown from an infant to now an independent toddler within less than 1 year of being with KES. The teachers are very loving and caring. Even the auntie who cooks the meals dote on my kid like their own as well- giving me the assurance and worry-free time to focus on work in the day., Loveliest kampung in the middle of the city. Friendliest teachers., Our daughter has been coming to infant care here since she was 3.5months old and absolutely loves it! We are very happy with this school and the teachers are great., This school must be a traumatic experience for the young children. Every time I pass by during the day I can hear how the staff is shouting at the children. Care is certainly not part of the DNA here ü•≤ ‚Ä¶, One of the best principals , Ms Kelly., Love the low student-teacher ratio., Cannot ask questions if you need to enrol your kid. Kids constantly crying whenever I passed by., Great, Caring teachers"

This also includes ensuring the enrichment classes are run smoothly during this period.  We will like to take the opportunity to thank the K2 teachers - Ms Sandra, Ms Tze Kee  and Chen Lao Shi for their delication and love for the students in the class. From the daily interactions with my girl, we were aware that the school provides good phonics foundation to prepare the students for their primary school education. It is indeed heart-warming to hear from my girl that Chen Lao Shi is a great teacher who inspires her to develop strong interest in Chinese Language for her own learning.  From: Mr & Mrs Wong (Parents of Janice Wong - K2), Always assured that my kid is in good hands. The school has a really awesome and responsible team. üëçüèº ‚Ä¶, Excellent preschool environment, A place to start learning, Good school, Caring staff and teachers with top facilities!"

Kinderland Preschool (Yio Chu Kang),"Thank you Ms Susan, Ms Elva, Zhang laoshi and Ms Vernon for being so patient in guiding the K1 children for the marching band. We truly enjoyed the performance. We appreciate the hard work put in by the team. Thank you for nurturing the children over the years, Thank you Ms Susan, teachers, and all the parent volunteers for their hard work to make this event a success. I'm awfully proud of my daughter's marching band performance and this cannot be done without the school. My kid has lots of fun and I think giving everyone a medal is a very nice touch at the end! However, it would be nice if event can be made shorter in future as it can be quite tiring for the kids and a few of the younger siblings were seen sleeping and being cranky., My girl attended this school since N2, the principal and teachers are amazing. They also have a very fantastic outdoor area which my girl gets to goes every morning and evening. Kinderland YCK also has the marching band - the only preschool that has it which my girl loves to participate., My both kids graduated from kinderland yck and it has been great.

Kinderland Preschool @ Sunshine Place,
Kinderland Preschool @ Woodlands Mart,"After the case. Still send my kids here. When I pick up my son last time, I say hi to one of the worker here. Not even a glance at me. I know I look shabby but have some respect. Not good customer service., The teachers and principal here truly care for the children and treat all the parents respectfully. Both my children, aged 5 and 3, have attended the childcare for several years and they love going to school everyday (when their tantrums don't kick in haha) and it's been a joy to be able to see them thrive so well there!, Both my babies are studying here since infant!

Learning Kidz @ Jubilee Square,"My baby attends this place since he was 4 months old and whenever I tell him in the morning we are going to school, he always giggle or smile.  Honestly that‚Äôs the best testimonial for me to know that the teachers at Learning Kidz are actually doing a good job taking care of the kids wellbeing.They are also cautious on viruses and keep parents informed about it.  Just for people whose curious - During my baby‚Äôs first two days, parents are also allowed to accompany their kids for their half day orientation. Allowing kids to ease into the environment.  School system uses both hand written book and in app. Even though there isn‚Äôt a check in image for babies, Teachers are always aware and cautious who picks and sends the kid so parents can feel safer.  You can also check out the place. I did it when I was still pregnant and I love the environment because it‚Äôs air conditioned and very clean.  Also it helps that there‚Äôs very friendly teachers who actually takes effort to know each kid in and out., We send our lil one at the age of 11months and i got to say this gotta be the best decision we ever make!  She was already very active at that point and all she wants to do is to play and play and play.. I love how they allow parents to sit & observe our kid for the first 2 days of orientation, for half a day, just to make sure they‚Äôre adapting to changes well. The teachers are all very lovable and most importantly each and every one of them are very attentive about every kid‚Äôs demand. I love how they‚Äôre very knowledgeable and will always share a few tips to us especially as a first time parents!  Also, the teachers will always keep us up to date regarding the viruses thats going on and also will never fail to ask/update parents if there‚Äôs any new spots/ scratch/ scar etc with the kid. Thank you Infant care teachers for taking a very good care of the kids! Well done! üëèüèª, On the July , While dining at the Ang Mo Kio S11 coffee shop, we had the pleasure of witnessing a group of children wearing Learning Kidz uniforms and holding the ring together . Their joy and camaraderie caught our attention . The vibrant teacher interacting with the children. Her affectionate and patient approach in tending to a crying child deeply resonated with us. Her genuine care and kindness left an indelible mark, leading me to believe that Learning Kidz would be the perfect environment for my daughter and I love this teacher so much even my husband also loves her on how she treats the kids so well and so patiently . She even quickly carry the kid when the kid was emotionally cry or even let go of the ring . I am so proud of her to being such a bubbly , cheerful and loving teacher towards the children . Give this learning kidz preschool a 5 star . Good job teacher and also your mask is very cute !! Hello kitty üòç, I am very impressed in this teacher who wear Hello Kitty mask as I saw the google review about her. It‚Äôs rare to see this type of teacher so caring , loveably and bubbly teacher and she is the best teacher I ever heard from review because I went thru all the google review in every centre and only the teacher that I saw 5 star rating is the Learning kidz amk . If you would like to enrol for your kids to preschool , I suggest your can enrol your kids to this preschool . We trust the teacher who are caring and not rough or anyhow hurt the kids by pulling them or put them down on the floor . Thank you to this unname teacher who show love and care and love to the kids . ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è  5 star rating for Learning kidz AMK, I want to thank the school for taking good care of my kids for the past 4 years! The teachers here really love the children and we can feel the passion in every interaction we had with the teachers. Our kids loved the school too and loved their teachers. Too bad we had to change school recently as we moved to a new place but kids sure miss their old school and teachers., School is decent - 2 stars taken away for being located in a mall where the escalators are FOREVER not working"
Learning Kidz @ Our Tampines Hub,
Learning Kidz @ Tampines Plaza,"Been here less than a year for both kids but my kids are well taken care of. They are happy. The teachers and principal are very nice and can see that they care for the children., I‚Äôm surprised by the bad reviews about CCA and teachers. My daughter spent 4 years there and she is really happy. The teachers are kind, the fees are extremely affordable, and the extra curriculum are completely optional. I compare Learningkids to mindchamp or posso I don‚Äôt find learningkids is at all non comparable, just the fee is way less. The only thing is learning kids have low teacher/student ratio, they follow MOE rules, whereas mindchamp has more teachers to take care of same number of students, If your kids is mild on spectrum don't even bother to visit.. after speaking to a kind teacher 15mins on phone and they say they have similar kids and can cope so we schedule a visit. When visiting, another unkind lady simply just want to make her job easy.... it would be easier if you reject me straight on phone., Horrendous place. The principal is very toxic. Tells my niece this on her last day ""bye, I hope I won't see you again"". The school is all about sucking money from the parents by organising tons of extra curriculum activities. If you do not consent your kids to pay and go for the activities, they will be treated badly by the school. Be prepared to spend 100 to 200 more a month to let your kids take part in those ""extra "" curriculum""., My kids enjoyed their stay at the centre. Conducive environment with friendly teachers and supervisors."

Learning Vision @ Harbourlink (Pasir Panjang),"Previously sent my infant daughter in as I've heard alot of great things about this ctr. Long wait list and extremely popular  among parents = good right? I'm sorely disappointed. We were on the wait list before I gave birth and she went in when she's around 6 mth old. The ctr is running at full capacity and at times I'm not sure if the teachers are able to cope or stretching at their max. First - My daughter 's bum constantly red from rash - most likely from delayed diaper change and no, she don't have delicates sensitive skin. Second - she's constantly having runs and I could see intact corns and brown rice in her waste. Ctr continued to feed her such items even after I expressed concern over the suitability as she's only 8 mth old. Even a fellow mummy said the same thing about her infant son, who's also at the Centre. During pick up, at times we will glance at her through the viewing glass. She will be sitting down and stoning. No evening activities or toys to engage her. Alot more issues which I will not go into details. We pulled her out of the Centre as their in charge are not keen to further engage us, but I would like to give thank to their admin support staff ms Joyce - she's super nice and helpful. Can't say the same about the rest. My ger right now is very happy and thriving at another Centre - mxxxxbear. One will not know the difference unless comparisons n are being made. Feel free to reach out to me if you wish to know more.  Yap, After combing through a lot of childcare centers, this is the one we chose because of the caring teachers and staff, even the non academic teachers are kind and friendly. My kids always come back with happy stories of school. Definitely a school we recommend!, Best experience for my kids"
Learning Vision @ Punggol Field,
Learning Vision @ Raffles Place,"The teachers at Learning Vision Raffles are really caring and have taught all 3 of my boys from age 2 onwards. They have a wide range of curriculum and activities to engage the little ones of different ages and encourage them to explore more about the world, even making new friends from overseas. It has been a joy partnering them to teach my children at every stage., My daughters love this school. Teachers are so kind. They teach English and Chinese well with fun activities. My older daughter English has improved since she starts to go to Learning Vision. Friends are nice also. I recommend this school., Me and my wife placed our kid at Learning Vision @ Raffles since she was 6 months old (she is 22 months old now) and have never regretted.  As our kid requires more time to adapt to a new environment, the staff there are very patient in making her comfortable. Now our kid goes to school everyday with a smile on her face.  The staff also give more frequent updates to new parents so that they will feel at ease that their kid is doing well in school.  We would like to thank all the staff in the centre for making our kid happy and comfortable!, We have 3 child in Learning Vision @ Raffles Place. Experience has been very positive so far. This is not a heavily academically driven school but they teach the right values and skills. Teachers do not change often (this is not always the case) and have been prompt with their replies. My children love their teachers in school. I got back the same caregiver for my latest baby whom remembered my earlier child so it is nice to have continuity.  Do note that the school compound is relatively small compared to LV@Interlocal. With the  restrictions lifted from Covid-19, I hope to see more outdoor activity soon!, Both my sons attended their preschool at Learning Vision @ Raffles Place. My elder son was not easy to be started with but with the passion, love and patience from the teachers, he managed to blend in and adapt to the routine eventually. Being able to transit my son from not eating in school to him eventually loving to go to school says a lot and means a lot to me. The teacher in charge maintained close communication with me on his onboarding to school as well. We received regular updates through the app which we parents appreciate so that we are kept updated on what our children is doing or learning in school. Given a choice again, my choice will still be learning vision. Thank you teachers!, Our child has been going to LV@Raffles Place since 18 months (toddler) and is now in kindergarten. All the class teachers we had over the years were caring and attentive and made learning enjoyable for our child. The centre is well run; even with  Covid putting stresses on manpower and causing additional work for staff, we never really felt any drop in care and teaching standards from our point of view. Communication with teachers is hassle free and any queries or concerns raised are promptly responded to., Our child has been with Learning Vision @ Raffles Place since Infant Care (she was still 3 months old then) and now she‚Äôs already in Nursery. We are satisfied with the progress and development we see in her. We trully appreciate all the teachers and staff for being so nurturing. As parents, it is important that we know our child is with the people we can trust. Lastly, the location is perfect for working parents within CBD, it‚Äôs very convenient for drop-off and pick-up., I have been sending my son to Learning Vision Raffles Place since he was 6 months old. My husband and I always appreciate the care and attention that has been given to our son. We felt that the teachers are very dedicated and always take the time and opportunity to update us on his progress. We greatly appreciate all the teachers‚Äô effort including teacher Mariati and Nisa in infant care, all the way to teacher Heidi and Hao Laoshi in PG, and also all the teachers who have assisted, including teacher Jenny who always cheerfully welcome all the kids when they enter the school. Kudos to the team!, Our child who is 2 and half has been attending LV @ Raffles since she was 5 months old and the experience has been great. For parents working in the CBD area, the school is perfectly situated in central CBD, making it very convenient for drop-offs and pick-ups. The teachers are extremely professional and caring; you can tell that they genuinely like to work with kids.  The school has a well thought out curriculum which puts emphasis on linguistics and athletics, taught through activities such as story telling, role playing etc. Our child specially enjoys the dance classes and the events that the school holds on every special occasions.  We receive frequent updates on our child‚Äôs development through pictures and newsletters so we‚Äôre always up to date. The school and the teachers are also very responsive whenever we have any questions or concerns.  Overall great experience and we look forward to enrolling our second child from next month., As my child is transitioning to Playgroup and nearing his end in Infant, just thought I'd post a write-up of my personal experience as a parent.  ""It takes a village to raise a child"" and for us, with no extended family support, the Infant team is our village. Our experience undoubtedly reinforced the decision to have our child enrolled at Learning Vision @ Raffles Place.  Giving special mention to Teacher Lalitha, who is Godsent; we cannot count how many times we say that we are blessed to have our child under her care. We feel her passion and love through the way she cares for our child and the bond / chemistry both child and myself have developed with her. She goes the extra mile and would always make us feel supported as working parents. We never had to worry.  Thank you Infant team, we are beyond grateful., We switched my kid's school from cherie heart to learning vision when he turned 14m, and this has been the best decision ever.  1) Spacious, clean, tidy, big kitchen, healthy meal, separate classroom, dedicated PE and music classroom, huge indoor playground and good student-teacher ratio are all the positive things we decided to join the school in the beginning 2) Teachers are responsive, attentive to the kids. All the teachers and staff remember each child and parent very quickly.  All the communication is flawless.  I particularly appreciate there are monthly newsletters and regular class updates for parents to know what they are learning at school and some great photos taken during the day. Not to mention there is take-home-kit for us to interact with kids after school from now and then. 3) Excursion is happening quite often since covid restrictions are off, and the covid or contagious disease info are shared transperantly and clearly. 4) Lots of event for parent to participate at school for us to feel inclusive 5) feedback is well received with quick improvement.  Other thing to note 1) there is no ramp for buggy at the building, it has been a bit hassle for us to lift the buggy through the stairs from the street to the entrance of the building.  Well not specific to the infant care itself but worth considering. 2) fruit variety is limited at infant care., If you are a working mum and need to entrust someone to take care and educate you kids, Learning Vision@Raffles Place is the right place to put your child in. Both my kids study there, one of them start as early as infant stage at 5mth old. The teachers and staff are really helpful to follow up and understand what the child need and often gives us feedbacks and suggestions. I like the way communication is smooth and clear. Teachers and Principal often engage them with play-base learning approach especially during Chinese lesson. Words can be remembered easily for the child through creative ways that the teachers come up with. The school and staff are nice, friendly and caring that my children look forward to going to school daily. This definitely makes our life easier in the morning :) Thank you Principal, Teachers and staff of LV@Raffles Place!!, we decided to enroll our toddler in this school cause we liked how bright, clean and organized the centre is (the contemporary indoor playground was definitely a plus too). we also had a chat with the teachers before making the decision and we liked that they seem to hold the same belief as us, that children no matter their age should be respected too, given the space to explore and question. been 2 years my toddler is with LV @ Raffles and still pleased with the decision we made. :), Both my kids went to this school (one has graduated). Excellent warm environment with caring teachers and staff for both infants and older kids. Good teacher to child ratio.  Was truly phenomenal during the last 2 years of the pandemic in terms of support and activities for the children to keep them engaged and connected with their friends. In the CBD and easily accessible; truly a wonderful school for young children to grow up in., My child who is currently in K2 have been attending LV@ Raffles since Infantcare. I have total peace of mind when I am at work as I know that my child will always be in good hands. All the teachers are kind and caring and are professionally trained in early childhood education. I enjoy seeing all the happy and smiley faces of the children whenever I pick-up or drop my child off to school. The school practices open channel of communication. I will receive regular updates of my child‚Äôs progress in the lessons that he attends in school. I can always contact the school if I have any queries and the teachers and staff are prompt in they response. I also like that the school adopts different methods in the delivery of their curriculum and offers a range of enrichment programmes. A BIG THANK YOU from my heart to ALL the teachers and staff at the school for their dedication and excellent work!!, We have sent both of our boys to Learning Vision @ Raffles Place. Teachers in both infant care and child care are nice and responsible. Teachers promptly update and communicate with us on our kids‚Äô development all the time. Kudos to all teachers in Learning vision @ Raffles Place., We used to have two kids in LV@Raffles Place and had experience with placing our elder child in other childcare centres and we were able to see the difference between LV and our child‚Äôs previous centre. First of all let‚Äôs just say the overall experience with LV had been absolutely great, we love the space available in the childcare for the kids to play and learn unlike some centres in the vicinity. The environment is clean, aircon not too cold for the kids and the teachers are a very dedicated bunch and they absolutely love the kids. Their pedagogy focuses on developing all rounded children, reading, and lots of hands on activities like preparing their own lunches, little reporters, learning from kids from other parts of the world etc. and they even have a dedicated PE teacher for the kids for exercise time. My elder kid still misses LV although he‚Äôs already in P1 and would always find time to go back to the centre to say hi to his teachers when he accompanies us to pick up his younger brother. Our youngest child is now thriving in LV and is loving his time while at the childcare and has been learning a lot of new things while in the PG class, he‚Äôs being very independent and has been able to do a lot of things on his own for a 2 yo., Excellent environment for our 2 kids - 1 and 3yo. My kids love the place, the teachers, they have many activities and meet great friends. As a parent, I can get updates through the school app, to follow their progress and be part of their activities. The place was also extremely safe during COVID pandemic., Both of our kids (3 & 1) feel great there and we can see their development everyday. More importantly they are happy to go there everyday and are happy when we pick them up in the evening. The teachers and staffs are understanding and helpful and easy to communicante with., Our son is going to learning vision on cecil street since he is 8 months. Starting in the infant section.  We are very happy with the teams. They are friendly and always available to answer our question directly and via the application.  We like to receive regular update, photo and video via the application.  We see our son growing daily while going there. The daily activities run by the teachers keep him stimulated.  They keep us closely inform during the covid 19 situation of what measures they were putting in place (mask, taking temperature, etc..), the special cleaning done, etc..., A very reliable and competent team which allows the little ones to develop at their own pace. Our little one has been with this center since 2019 and showed tremendous developmental progress - thanks to the love and nurturance of everyone (teaching & non-teaching staff). Curriculum caters to holistic development of the child grounded in a curiosity for learning which is enjoyable. Really pleased with the service so far., Teachers at Learning Vision @ Raffles are caring and took care of our kids from infant time. They made learning so fun that the kids are looking forward to go to school daily., In CBD so parents can pick up without rushing, great teachers who are passionate in teaching, great environment where one supports one another. A definite go to if you are looking for a place for your lil one., School is up to expectation. Teachers and staffs are always on the ball. The services provided made the parents felt at ease when the kids are in school. That smile on the kids shows everything, Best decision ever to send our child to this place and we can see the tremendous change in her. The teachers are always caring and putting the kids‚Äô interest at their priority., My girl has been going to learning vision since she was an infant and she loves the school and teachers."

Learning Vision @ Work Pte Ltd (Changi Business Park II),"Visited many many preschool before deciding this center for my first born . It turn out to be one of the best choice i made in my parenting journey . The teachers have good rapport within parents , child and even among teachers. The curriculum is strong that my firstborn had no problem adjusting and keeping up when she enter primary school . They make sure that the children and parents are informed of every minor and major change . Yearly when the children are promoted to the next level , current teachers will take lots of time to prepare , preempt the children of the changes ahead, making sure that they are informed , ready and looking forward .  Teachers are very dedicated . They deal with parents anxiety , concern and children safety with such thoughtfulness that you know that they truly care for your children .

My second born is now in the school , she always tells me about her day in school , and its always with bright smile . She always look forward to going to school .  This is one place that brings out the sunshine in children . good work LV@CBP !, My child has been with Learning Vision Soo Kee for the past 4 years, we see our child happily looking forward to attending school every single day and we know that the teachers must have been committed and devoted to make every day a fun and enriching experience for my child.  Our child would always come home with a smile to tell us how she enjoyed the classes and activities in school every day.  The school premises are clean, tidy, and well maintained. This is especially important during this pandemic period, where our child well-being is of utmost importance.  We would like to thank all the passionate teachers in Learning Vision who have worked so hard to educate and care for my child. They are constantly putting in extra effort to update us on our child progress. Every single teacher and staff member is very friendly and supportive, they are willing to listen and offer guidance if we have any concerns.  We are happy to make the right choice to enroll our child in Learning Vision Soo Kee. We are grateful to all the teachers in helping our child grow and nurture in her early childhood years.  Keep up the good work!!, Learning Vision@CBP creates a safe and clean environment for my kids to have a joyful learning experience from their early years to preschool. Teachers and staff are passionate and dedicated.‚ù§ School food menu are well planned and healthy. My kids are always looking forward to attend school every day! üôÇ ‚Ä¶, Learning Vision @ Changi Business Park shifted from Eightrium to the current Soo Kee Building a few years back. The current premise boasts an indoor playground as the centre stage, surrounded by children's classrooms and a music/multi-purpose room. Down the other hallway, classrooms are set aside for STEM programme which is offered in their core curriculum. Having been my children's childcare centre for the past 8 years, the reviews from the kids themselves prove that the centre is a place for joyful learning. The centre has seasoned and experienced teachers, administrative and support staff who have been there since Day 1 when we joined, albeit some staff changes which is common for the early childhood sector. The children love the indoor playground, opportunities to explore the outdoor vicinity, enrichment sessions such as speech and drama, science, language and music classes (some are offered as extra curriculum, fees separately charged). Lessons are also fun and exciting and the activities for each child is unique to their class/year as teachers have the autonomy to plan and explore different activities for the required development curriculum skills. Teachers not only focus on the core curriculum required for the pre-primary years, they also focus on the emotional and personality development of the children. Regular curriculum updates are given via the Little Family Room, and it doubles up as a communication platform with parents. There are regular platforms to engage parents on the curriculum and periodic take home kits for family engagement, sharing about what the children learned and how parents can continue to engage and participate in the child's learning journey. There is adequate parking lots for safe drop off and pick up too.  The Busy Bee management, which oversees the Learning Vision centres, is also visible at various milestones, engaging parents when required and available when needed.  Overall, my family has a wonderful experience with LV@CBP!, We are glad to have entrusted my child's education to LV@Soo Kee HQ since 2017. While the school relocated from the Eightrium to its current premises a few years ago, the school never lost sight of creating a safe, nurturing environment where learning is a joyful experience.  Besides a focus on moulding each child's character & values, the school also ensures the children are well-equipped in their learning to embark on primary school in the english & chinese language, math & STEM curriculum. Time is also allocated for children to explore music & play in fun & interactive ways. There are plenty of individual & group work for the older children, providing them with opportunities for independent work & to hone their social & interpersonal skills.  It's heartening that the school's principal, teaching & support staff put in their utmost best to support each child's learning, and always keep in close communications with parents using either the LittleLives app or email/phone call. Regrettably, there were turnover in experienced teaching staff in recent years. Hope the centre's management will be able to bring on board dedicated teachers to continue the high quality education parents value.  Please keep up the good work! We look forward to enrolling our younger child into the school later this year :), My first kid enrolled in LV@ CBP since 2015 and its has been a positive experience for both the child and the parents. The curriculum is enriching and you can observed great improvement in their personal growth over the years. The staff and teachers are very passionate, dedicated and professional in their work. I am assured my kids are in good hands in the school. When they moved to Soo Kee Building, we continued with them and enroll my 2nd child. This is a testimonial of my trust in them.  Great job to all the staff in LV@Soo Kee!, All our children attended this centre from Nursery to Kindergarten, when they were at Eightrium to their current location at Soo Kee Building. We feel all the members (from the Principal, teachers, administrator to even the Aunty in charge of meals and cleaning) display professionalism and dedication to their work. Their programmes prepared our children adequately for Primary One, and those who have left LV often mention fondly about their time at the centre. Highly recommended if you are looking for a pre-school in this vicinity!, My child has been attending LV since she was an infant. The one thing that appealed to me strongly was the cleanliness of the place. The centre ensured that each case (be it hfmd, or even Covid) be dealt with seriously to prevent any outbreak. Her IFC teachers also engaged her and taught her so many things that I won't be able to if I home-school her.  I am thankful that teachers also took time out to update me about any minor accidents that occur in school (can be as small as a scratch haha), and they are always assuring that my child is coping fine. Her PG teacher even noticed that she's more sensitive than others, and knew exactly how to handle her.  I will also enrol my second child in this school when the time comes. Thank you for making learning so much fun for my firstborn., My son feels so much happier at this school. Nice teachers, nice environment, happy children, happy parents, This is a very good school. I like the tide and nice environment. The teachers are always smiling, and I can see the school is with a good management. The school has a systematic learning programme. They do not only teach children how to read and write, but also how to present. The school also offers STEM enrichment class and junior athlete class (included in school fee).  Highly recommended!, Our 3 boys spent their first 6 years in Learning Vision CBP. I would say this is not only a place for learning but it is also a place safe for exploration, self-development and making friends.  They enjoyed the various mini projects, show & tell and outdoor excursions during the pre-covid days. Things did not tone down during the pandemic lockdown and the teachers go beyond the means to engage with the kids creatively. Kudos to them!  These could not materialise without the dedication and commitment from the staff within LV CBP. It‚Äôs just amazing how each of the teaching staff could easily recognise every parent and their names, making sure the kid is being fetched by an ‚Äúauthorised‚Äù personnel.  You know your kids have been well taken care of and enjoy themselves when they still talks about what happen during the days in LV after graduated and in primary school., Great preschool with dedicated Teachers, and staff that are service driven, cheerful and build a connection with the children. Well organised facility, and communication channel keeping you informed on learning progress and activities being conducted., My kids attend LV SooKee since young.

Thanks LV SooKee!!!, The campus is very clean and safe, teachers are very kind and patient. The school has a lot programs for kids development, so the kids enjoy their learning experience., Great place for my children to develop and learn., Passionate teachers & school‚Äôs cleanliness on point, Highly recommended, the school is clean and tidy.

Learning Vision @ Work Pte Ltd (NUH Medical Centre),"My boy started his learning journey with Learning Vision @ NUHS at the age of two. We are glad that he has enjoyed his time in the school till today at K2; making good progress.  The teachers are great, caring and focused in all areas. The school system is in place and continues to improve; when necessary.  The team (principal, teachers and non-teaching staff) remains uncompromising in the time of Covid.  Our heartfelt thanks for their commitment and with this assurance, it gives us a peace of mind that the kids are in good hands when we are at work :), We‚Äôve had 3 kids enrolled here since the time they were eligible (at 18 months old) and am ever grateful to the staff who have essentially helped raised them. In fact, we‚Äôve never had issues potty training our children as their teachers did the job for us!  The school‚Äôs curriculum is pretty decent as well, and has helped prepared our child sufficiently for primary school. We also appreciate that we get timely DETAILED feedback from the teachers on each child‚Äôs progress in school.  More importantly, genuine care and concern is discernible in every single one of our children‚Äôs teachers, and continues to be displayed long after the child has graduated and moved on to primary school. That was paramount to us as parents and am thankful that LV managed to deliver., I have 3 kids and all have been enrolled to Learning Vision @NUHS since they turned 18/20 months (the centre has limited vacancies, so not all of my kids managed to get in once they turned 18m!) my eldest has since graduated last year. 2nd and 3rd are still in the centre. I am forever grateful for the ever kind, patient, enthusiastic, loving and inspiring teachers we have encountered in the centre. The teachers are not just patient with the kids, but also patient with us, the anxious parents, especially when my eldest first started. I won‚Äôt forget the sparkles I saw in one of the teachers‚Äô eyes whenever she shared with me the progress of my second girl. My girls love going to school, talking about their teachers, classmates, and always surprise me with what they have learnt in the school. Keep up the good work!, I have two children in this childcare since they were 18 months. The teachers are very nurturing and motivating.

All the teachers are very friendly and responsible. Kids enjoy go to childcare and they do learn lots of things at the center. Their curriculum is very good.

The principle and teachers always keep parents updated about events at school and get feedback from parents. I would recommend this childcare to all my friends., This childcare for hospital staff has been taking care of my children since 2 years ago. The school is able to retain their staff, much better than some who have high staff turn over rates. The school also actively seeks feedback from parents to improve their programmes and curriculum. The staff are dedicated and my children like going to school. Will be great for staff if they offer infant care but they have space constraint., We are very grateful for the excellent education our daughter received in learning vision school. Ana has made very good progress in both English and Chinese languages as well as other aspects of education.  When she started her primary 1 education in January this year in International School she adjusted easily to the curriculum and received very good feedback from teachers for her level of education and knowledge in English and Chinese language. Her current Chinese language teacher assessed her knowledge of Chinese language above average and on top in class.  We are very happy that this transition period has become easier for Anastasiia due to her education in Learning Vision. She attended additional Chinese language classes in Learning vision as well as additional once weekly lessons in Chengzhu school in the last few years. All this contributed significantly to her confidence and improvements in Chinese language learning.

I appreciate that they focus on all-round development and emphasize on the importance of life skills., Both my kids are in ttsh lv since infant .

Really appreciate all the staff in TTSH LV, Have been with LV for past 7 years for my two kids. So far I can say ok! Except the teacher‚Äôs turn over is too high at one period! Almost changed 6 Teachers for my younger child within 2 years. Thanks for all the effort for the past years on my kids. The Teachers are friendly and approachable., This is her 2nd month in LV@TTSH. We started here in Feb 2022 as it is closer to wife's workplace. Everyday, we see that she is very excited to go to school and whenever we pick her up, we would see her cheerful smile greeting us. The teachers were nice and helpful. Feedbacks for improvements were followed up promptly.  Overall, a great experience for us and we believe for her as she is experiencing new things everyday (they have a photo album for every month's activity)., My 3 children have been attending LV@TTSH childcare since infancy.

Appreciate their hard work and dedication!, Both my kids are studying in LV, and i'm glad they are enjoying the school so much that they look forward to go to school everyday!

Learning Vision @ Work Pte Ltd (Woodlands Vista Point),"My daughter loves to go to school everyday, The Principal Ms.Joanna is very approachable. When we have our concern she took a swift action to remedy the situation. The teachers are very loving & caring towards my child. I can see positive improvements along the way with my child as she progresses up the level since playgroup. Thank you Teachers & staff of Lv@vistapoint!, It was the right choice for me to enrol my daughter in Learning Vision. Despite some parents have phobia after hearing some other childcare centre practices, LV@Vista proved to be different and gave assurance to the parents. Its so heart warming to see my girl come home everyday telling me the fun things she had in school, how she enjoyed the activities planned for the children, lastly would surely be the care and boundless love received from the teachers., My kids enjoy going to school daily. They will come back home with many interesting topics to tell us. From daily living to world's news to environment to animals to even cooking!! My kids not only learning the usual old school thingy but learn alot more other than what the books taught them!! Never regret choosing Learning vision at vista point! Not to mention their Principle, teachers and aunties are all super friendly and helpful!, Delicated and friendly teachers and staff. Teachers are attentive and give regular feedbacks through various channel, eg school app, phone calls, even face-to-face. They are not hesitate to share information about my kids even if I just bumped into them outside the school, which I feel they are so passionate about teaching. We are very blessed to have chosen Learning Vision Vista.  All my 3 kids are with them and they are very happy to go to school everyday! They will come back and share with us what they have learnt during the day, and what they do in school.  Thank you Learning Vision Vista Point., This school is spacious, provides a nice, conducive and holistically environment for my 3 childs. It is equipped with many things for the children to learn. Teachers are really helpful and principal is very approachable and helpful too. I put all my 3 kids, in from infant to K2. Last year, we enrol in our youngest 2 yr old infant and ever since , she loves to attend full day school and will carry her own bag, wear her shoes and put on her masks.The activities and programmes are very interesting which really help nurture my children and the food provided are nice and nutritious too. I will greatly recommend this place to parents who are looking for a preschool., The teachers and staff are patient, friendly and most importantly approachable, and my child really enjoys going to the school every day. He shares stories with me about the fun he had in school and what he learned. My decision to enroll him in this school since he was two year old has proven to be the right one., Friendly teachers, staff and principal who are always welcoming and approachable. There‚Äôs always prompt updates on the children related to school matters. Lessons are fun and engaging as well!  A good school for any parents who wish for their children to learn and enjoy at the same time!, We, parents of Irfan Amsyar, Iris Amirah and Irsyad Arsel would like to thank and applaud for all the hard work and effort that this centre has put into ensuring the safety, hygiene, growth and needs of my children are met. I have trusted Learning Vision service since my first born in toddler and  I am pleased that the staff in the centre are always warm and welcoming towards all children and they kept us assured that the children are in safe hands. Till now at the age of 16, my first born is able to remember the sweet and memorable memories that he had In Learning Vision with Teacher Puteriah and Teacher Grace. They have employed good and professionals Educators that you can rely on and have a piece of mind at work. Thank you for being the best set of educators I have ever met! You guys are awesome and extraordinary Educators! . Thank You., Our son has been with LV @ VP for 3 years now. He has always been loving school and it is like a daily routine whereby he would ask if he is attending school the next day! Even if he had to stay home when he‚Äôs unwell! We believe this would not have happened without the educators‚Äô love and concern towards him or any of the children in the centre for that matter. Kudos to the staff for their passion in nurturing him to be what he is now and shaping his future.  A Huge shout out to Teacher Puteri, Teacher Raha, Teacher Shikin and Tan Laoshi and to all staff at LV @ VP,  Thank you! ‚ù§Ô∏è, My boys love their school, teachers and their friends! They have learnt so much there and really appreciate the guidance and care the teachers have given them. It‚Äôs a pity we have to change school as we moved house.

The teachers and principal are friendly and helpful, highly recommended!, Great!, Since 2014, my three children have entered this kindergarten one after another. It is my first choice and my most ideal choice. Facts have proved that my choice was right. My children are in I am very happy here. I have learned a lot about life and study. Their teaching model is also very suitable for children's interests. The principal, English teacher, Chinese teacher and aunt are all friendly and patient. I am very lucky to have such a place near my home. Kindergarten, give them a thumbs up üëçüèª!"

Registered my daughter for infantcare & able to start with immediate effect.. so thankful cos i am able to settle even ƒì 1st mth depo thru CDA.. just need to fork out $23 for comm book & materials üëçüèº ‚Ä¶, The employees weren't professional and zero pedagogical approach concerning learners needs."
Little Big Pre-School Pte Ltd,"Our family moved to east coast last October and Little Big was our first choice for our 2 kids. When we did the school tour we were impressed with the coziness and positive vibe of the facility as well as friendliness of staffs and teachers who would be directly involved with our kids‚Äô classes. We decided to move forward and very happy with the choice. The kids adjusted very quickly and the teachers were very accommodating to our requests. So far so good‚Ä¶, Ms Jasmine and her team are exceptional in their care and attention towards the children. My son had his best 1.5 years in Little Big Preschool. The teachers are warm, friendly, knowledgeable, and skilled. My boy was always telling me that he had fun in school. We had to transfer to another preschool due to relocation. We would definitely recommend Little Big Preschool to any parent looking for a safe and nurturing environment!, My daughter is not the easiest when it comes to drop off. Thankfully, her teachers and the staff are really patient and loving towards her throughout her PG journey. Things are much better now - she even sleeps without her pacifier in school! (Why can't she do the same at home??) I am also appreciative of the teacher's daily updates that come with photos of her enjoying her time. It gives me a good understanding of how she is in school. Also, I love it whenever I see cute hairstyles on her during pick up. Thank you LB!, Our children attended LBPS for close to two years and so far we have been quite happy with our choice. The teachers were great. Environment is clean and safe. The curriculum and activities is good, children love it! So far we‚Äôve been satisfied and will miss the school when the children officially graduate !, My two boys attended this school. They spent two years there, and during that time, they not only learned a lot but also experienced significant growth under the care and love of the teachers. The teachers were patient and genuinely cared about the well-being of the kids. They were always open to communication whenever I needed to discuss anything.  Unfortunately, we had to leave the school due to relocating to a different country, but we cherish the wonderful memories we made at Little Big. A big thank you to the teachers for their dedication and support!, I am sharing with you this review since I know the owner and centre manger personally for quite some time and my son attended this pre-school for many years. This is lovey boutique pre-school in the heart of Telok Kurau. One of their differentiators is driving the kampung spirit and focus on togetherness in D15. The school is coming with a nice outdoor space, though not fully sun covered. It is fair to say the hard product is a bit outdated and the school has been facing some teacher attrition post covid. But I truly respect the consistent leadership with a strong focus on their core values. All kids and parents are treated equally, regardless of status or race. Safety, respect and supporting each other are just some values you can feel are lived here day to day. Miss Chai, the manager of the school is coming with more than 25 years of experience in early childhood education. While she has been running large international schools in Sweden for many years, she was born and raised in the East Coast District of Singapore. Her ability to switch seeming less between English and Mandarin and her consultative and loving approach has been acknowledged and praised by many parents. My boy loved the place and I can highly recommend you to make a visit and check if this is the right place for your child., I had a wonderful experience working at Little Big. It was a positive working environment and the staff cared for the children. The management was also supportive of me during my time there! Would definitely recommend this school as a place to work., Our son really enjoyed the year he spent at Little Big! Although he did only half days there, it was a good learning experience for him with lots of interaction and activities. We also appreciated that the children are exposed to Mandarin every day. Frequent updates on the school‚Äôs app with pictures and videos kept us informed of what was going on in class. His teachers were kind and caring, and we were especially impressed by Ms. Jasmine, who is charge of the school. We would recommend Little Big as a solid local pre-school/daycare!, What a wonderful pre-school. My little boy started at Little Big when he was 18 months, he is now 3.5 years and absolutely loves going to school. He talks about his teachers everyday and I'm still amazed by the things he learns. The school is small and intimate and extremely focused on being family oriented, we really feel part of this community. All staff are amazing, friendly and highly educated. Would highly recommend this preschool!!!, My 3 year old attends Little Big. Now, she's not an easy nut to handle, extremely strongheaded, emotional but very expressive, chip off the old man.  But Little Big is so patient with her and she's growing up to be an awesome kid, she sings, dances and she is allowed express herself. The teachers are warm, they are real (you can feel it), they are not doing a job, they mean what they say and your child, hanging out with them with grow up to be very sincere human beings.  Education wise, they are very play and sensory. I love it, you can be book smart when you are older, but this, you got to have it at a young age. Little Big smashes this aspect.  If you want your child to be in a loving, real, cosey and dynamic environment, this is where you should be., I sent my son for Dec holiday before he entering the primary school, and I was extremely appreciated their quality of the service, sincere heart towards the kids and check-in & check-out system through the app. I am a workong mother and always called my helper to check if they reached, but their system made me concern free. Once they checked-in, it immediately alerted me through the app with their photos. This is a big thing especially for those working mothers. My son also absolutely enjoyed when he was there. If I had one more child, this would be my 1st choice!, I placed my son in Little Big Pre-School when a friend recommended me to this place. The teachers here are friendly and helpful with my child as he tends to be shy and doesn't like to mingle with other kids. But I see improvement on his social skills. He now talks more and can express his feelings clearly. He can also form proper sentences., We moved countries with our 31/2 year old daughter. Even though we knew kids are extremely adaptable there was still a certain amount of anxiety. It was a change of weather, culture, food, language and even people. But for Meher Little Big became a home away from home. She immediately fit in and with a little help from her teachers and aunties even overcame the little hiccups with food and communication. I loved the fact that they treated Meher in a way that was best suited for her per SE rather than what applies to one and all. They saw her as an individual and cared for her and helped her grow in a way that was unique to her. She had made quantum leaps when it comes to her communication, the way she has recognized her passion points, her imagination and most importantly her confidence to speak her mind. I will forever be grateful to her teachers, friends and  the staff of Little Big who helped her grow so beautifully over the time we were in Singapore. For every parent their child is the most important aspect and if you wish to give your little one a learning environment that is fronted  with love, care and mindfulness...this maybe the place you're looking for., My girl cried through out the year due to separation anxiety, the staff and teachers given lots of loves and attentions as well as encouragement to her, finally she is looking forward to go school every morning! Now she is able to share with me her daily fun activities in the school. Thanks Little Big!!, Improper injury incident management shows the school is not putting kids' safety on the top priority. We made a police report then only able to see the CCTV. CCTV showed that the teacher was using her handphone. The saddest thing is, the first thing that the school did was not to show concern on my kid, but to ask us for withdrawal so that they can close the case.  The centre manager, Jasmine Chai, is only trying to cover up the accident instead of looking into the real issues and provide solution. She did not arrange the meeting with the higher management as well.  I do hope the owner of the school will see this and take serious actions. The school service has been deteriorating., Our 2 kids embarked on the LBP 3 years ago as we first arrived in Singapore. What a great experience as a family to join this loving Little Big community and get to know the neighborhood better through the school. We witnessed our kids blossom at LBP. The holistic learning approach is stunning and gives the kids great confidence and curiosity to always learn more. They also learn how to collaborate, respect each other, in a loving environment. I am very grateful to this school and amazing  teachers, thanks for everything!, It has been nearly 2.5years since our daughther joined LBP and we only regret she cannot stay there longer. Teachers challenge kids in the most creative way and always let us in awe about how complex and balanced is the program with extra CV activities like cooking, dance and drama on every week. We love the creative, hands on approach and how teachers manage to teach kids creatively through games, dialogue and teamwork - such a progressive approach building skills so relevant for 21st century. Current affairs are always part of the discussion and seasonal celebrations used to learn more about various cultures and customs. And most importantly it is the kindness the kids are exposed to and teached. Principal, Ms Ruby remembers all kids by first name always spending time to chit chat with her little students. And we will miss so much Ms Lia and Ms Wang Lao Shi who were the kindest guides on our girl's first learning journey. Thank you for everything!, Convenient location within neighbourhood. My kids enjoy times spend with their friends in school. Teachers quality used to be better I missed Ms Shun and Sufhyia a lot. I'm very glad to have such passionate and full with loves strategy manager, Ms Jasmine., In the brief time my child attended, they'd managed to pry him out of his shell and he's since grown to be a confident, inquisitive, and thoughtful, young man. A dedicated and caring bunch, everyone really does feel like family here., Teachers are caring with love. As a parent, I really like the way they teach the kids. My child very much enjoys daily activities at the school. Cozy and family feel childcare centre!, Fantastic school.  Very caring and professional staff.  The kids get a lovely and healthy cuisine for their meals.  Highly recommend the school!, Our son was in this preschool after being in another preschool. We immediately saw the difference in the care and attention from the school and staff. We also saw an improvement in our sons development, Need to update my review. I feel that the level of care has dropped dramatically. Teachers need a lot more training on how to manage children and their emotions., Great pre-school with a good mix of local international students. Very well kept classrooms/facilities and dedicated teachers who are really responsible. Should be a great option for expats at the East., The performance of the school has dropped significantly. Teachers are leaving and the replacement were not really in place. Management is poor and not transparent., Little big is great - cozy - home feel school. The teachers are caring and the principal is loving. I have loved this school for my child., The principal and teachers are so loving and dedicated towards making the kids feel like school is their second home.they are so patient and caring and positive and keep updating the parents on everything that happens in school., Poor management, high teacher attrition., My son enrolled into Little Big when he was 19 months and it was a wonderful journey for 3 years until we had to leave at K1. I feel that my son‚Äôs learnt a lot and had a lot of fun there too. He enjoyed his Chinese and English lessons and playing outdoors with friends and teachers. I love that they had field trips and excursions once in a while. Teachers are caring, attentive and fun. If we‚Äôre back in the area in a year we would definitely go back to Little Big for the K2 and graduation."
Little Dolphins Playskool (Choa Chu Kang),"Good school with many activities n courses for the kids to join., Child care center"
Little Footprints Preschool (Admiralty),"I like the warmth shown by teachers upon receiving my son. The centre is bright and colorful and looks welcoming. It is also clean. My son has adjusted very well to the school and has been willingly to enter the school without much coaxing. Overall we are very satisfied with the school., Why the branch directors said who having coughing, fever, phlegm are strictly not allowed to come to the school! Why some of the children still can tell their parents that they had coughing medicine at school! And I can hear some of the children still coughing(phlegm) while I fetching my child! How could this happened in current situation after gave us a promise., The environment is conducive for my daughter, and the teachers are very friendly, professional., Thanks to all the teachers for taking good care of my two children from infant to K2., Teachers are very attentive ! They did a very great job ! üëèüèºüëèüèº ‚Ä¶, Care for the children. Teachers are nuturing and full of ‚ù§Ô∏è"
Little Footprints Preschool (Ang Mo Kio),"Happy Teacher‚Äôs Day to all the teachers in my son‚Äôs (Mason) Playgroup Class 2023! Kudos to Teacher Vidya, Teacher Sylvia, Teacher Nicole and Summer, for their care and patience of my son.  Such a splendid school with a nurturing and joyful learning environment!  Definitely recommend!  Thank you all‚ò∫Ô∏è, My child has been at Little Footprints (AMK) since he was 4 months old. Over the last 5 months, the teachers have been constantly providing feedback and updates on our child. As a first-time mother, I was very concerned over handing over my child‚Äôs care to someone else; the teacher called me before his first day to have a better understanding of his likes/dislikes and methods to comfort him. The teachers appear to be committed and caring towards the children and will upload weekly photos of our child engaged in the activities. They are also open to feedback regarding our child‚Äôs care. They are consistent in checking the child‚Äôs mouth, hands, and feet at every check-in and will report on health incidents (eg HFMD, Herpangina) on the app promptly. Thank you Teacher Lav, Teacher Krist, Tracher Irlianna and Teacher Kathleen for your love and care towards my child! We appreciate you!, I loved the warmth of the teachers at LFP, AMK. They have always cheerfully received my children every morning and I have also seen how my children comes back every day to tell me their school day - and it was clear that they have enjoyed school a lot!, Extremely caring teachers. Special shout out to vicky who helped me out promptly in an urgent situation!, My daughter has been with Little Footprints AMK for 6years... Initially when I enrolled her at 18mths she had very bad separation anxiety but with all the friendly teachers and fun activities in school she settled down very well... Everyday my daughter looks forward to going to school.. A special mention to Teacher Tana who has been my daughter's form teacher since N2, my daughter had definitely gained alot of knowledge through the her interesting class activities. She is also a teacher who has very good bond and communication with the parents... Happy Teacher's Day to all the Teachers, Aunties and Ms Viky of LFP AMK.. Kudos to the awesome team !!!, Happy Teacher‚Äôs Day to all the teachers in LFP Amk! I would like to send in my heartfelt thanks to Teacher Tana and Zou Lao Shi for their guidance and friendship. Even though Ashlyn only joined this school since K1, her academic knowledge and writing skills has improved tremendously over the past year due to patient and loving teachers. Not forgetting the intern teachers, they have been kind and helpful as well. Kudos to all!, A big THANKS to all the teachers in LFP AMK. They have taken great care of my older boy for 5.5 years who is now in Primary 1. Through those years, he has developed his confidence and social skills perfectly. I would like to specially mention Tr Tana who has seen him through since he was 18 months.  My younger boy is in the PG class now. I am very sure he will be very well taken care of too. Jing Jing Lao Shi, Zhao Lao Shi and Tr Vidya constantly provides feedback about him so that I know what happens to him each day when I pick him up. Every developments they observed about him will also be updated onto the 'LittleFamilyRoom' App. Kudos to all the effort there! Happy Teachers Day!!, Special thank you Teacher Tana for your friendship, guidance and discipline. We cannot always be with our child, but we know that Alexis is loved and cared for when she is in your class. We have watched her become more confident and stronger. Each day, it seems like she always has something new to share with us. When we ask where she learned it, she always says that you taught her! Thank you for taking the time to teach our child and for helping her become the best that she can be!  We are so grateful to have you as our child‚Äôs teacher. You are more than just an educator, and we cannot thank you enough.  p/s : Xie Xie Zou Laoshi for your superb effort to make her Chinese improved significantly in such a short period of time., Have been with LFP for 5 years already. The teachers are loving and caring. My girls love going to school and we know they are in good hands. Teacher Smitha and Zhao Laoshi are patient and gentle with my girl. She cried for more than 6 months during drop-offs but they patiently comfort her every day. I can't even imagine where they find their calm. I would have pulled some hair, LOL. My eldest loves Teacher Tana and Teacher Ruby too. So grateful I found them., Thank you Tr Smitha, Tr Vidjya and Zhao ËÄÅÂ∏à for taking care and teaching both my kids. It is not easy to take care of a class of 3years old, where more attention and more work is involved, Tr Smitha and Zhao ËÄÅÂ∏à has done a great job!  Thank you for the patience towards my K1 boy, as he is always daydreaming üòÖ and his Chinese is very weak...would appreciate a little more patience towards him. Also want to thank Ms Vicky for being a good principal and always very helpful üòÅ Happy Teacher's Day to all the teachers!, Definitely have to thank Teacher Ruby and Zou Lao Shi for being so attentive to Damarius, always keep us updated and informed on his school's progress and work, which always gives us a peace of mind on his daily time spend in school. My son never fails to mention both teachers at home and it's always glad to hear from him on what he has learned in school from his teachers. Thank you teacher and Lao Shi for doting on him all the time!, My kids were enrolled between 2 to 3 years here and I was glad to have pulled them out of this incompetent school.  The management is always on the defensive side,  teachers lack competence in dealing with young children and are quick to put labels on any child that is slower in learning etc. They lack training and the necessary soft skills and posture to handle young children. There were incidents of unacceptable practices as described by my child which were serious enough for us to make a report to ECDA.  Shifted my older child to MOE Kindergarten and it has been the best decision we have ever made. My child has undergone a positive transformation away from the negativity of this preschool. Our only regret was not pulling him out sooner.  This LFP school was a complete letdown and there is no CCTV installed to verify any of the alleged incidents - which leads me to believe that the staff were probably emboldened by this. The management had also said for more than a year that they were stabilising WIFI infrastructure  as an excuse to not install CCTV. I do not trust this school nor the management and would not recommend such a school to any parent. You need to have just one conversation with the principal of this school and this will shed light on the attitude of the management. Cluster manager Lily is also more intent on ensuring that her teachers don't leave the school (manpower issues I guess) than on really wanting to resolve these issues and set acceptable standards., My 4 kids are in LTF (AMK) since my eldest started in year 2015, I would said all the teachers and non teaching staff are devoted and caring, even the interns too.  Especially to Teacher Tanaletchmy, she taught my eldest son when he‚Äôs in K1, without her, Triston would not have come this far.. been very grateful that she highlighted to me about his special conditions. And with the early intervention, Triston has so much of improvement in LTF with the monitoring of his K2 teacher, Teacher Ruby and also his chinese teacher, Wang laoshi who had left the service.  The teachers keep us updated on my kids development and they put in the extra effort to prepare learning resources for our kids to learn at home.  Thank you once again to Little footprint for an incredible early childhood curriculum that engages and teaches at all steps of the day., Happy Teachers' Day to all the teachers at LFP! All teachers are very caring towards the students, even though they are not from their classes. Special mention to Jing Jing Lao Shi and Ms Riza for being patient and attentive in caring for my girl. A big thank you to them!, Great teachers who are constantly keeping busy parents/guardians updated through various platforms (comm book, portfolio updates, whatsapp, calls). Never too busy to hear out a concern. So much that my kid actually misses his teacher, Ms Ruby,  and classmates even BEFORE going off on a family holiday! Made us bring him to school for half a day, even though we were home to take care of him., Special mention for Jing Jing Laoshi, who is always very observant, meticulous and diligent in keeping parents updated with the progress of their kids. Especially when the kid gets into small mishaps such as scratches or display seemingly different behavioural traits, she makes an effort to update the parents when the kids are picked up at the end of the day or via a phone call. Thankful to her for all the hard work and love shown to the little children. Says a lot when they greet and see her with such joy and enthusiasm., Thankful to all of Asher's teachers: Tr Ruby, Zuo Laoshi, n Tr Aishah. Asher really like all of you. Thank you for the constant reminders n stuff that is going on, be it via WA or comm book. Really appreciate! Pls keep up the good work! Happy Teacher's day!, Kaijun just joined for little footprints preschool since Jan 2019. He has learned a lot and picking up speaking and hands on skills. I would like to thanks to Ms Smitha and zhao Laoshi for your caring and loving towards kaijun. Thanks for taking good care of him during his school times., Condusive environment for learning and great teachers with constant updates , love and care for their students. Special thanks to Teacher Vidya and Zhao lao shi for grooming and upbringing the K1 2019 kids well !, Jing Jing Lao Shi, you teach with love and effort and energy that draws in every student. She is one great teacher. Thank you so much., Many thanks to teachers Vidya, Jingwen, Jing Jing, Riza and ËµµËÄÅÂ∏àfor their love and guidance for the kids! Happy teacher's day! üíê ‚Ä¶, Poor management! Terrible with No reply at all. Their HQ arranged a site visit. But thereafter there was no reply from the principal even after 3-4 repeated emails asking about the space for my kid.  At least have a little courtesy to reply instead of ignoring., Thanks to Teacher Tana and Zou Laoshi and all the teachers in AMK LFP, keeping the kids and parents busy with lots of activities.. Happy Teacher‚Äôs Day!, All Teacher nice and very good take for teach and take care of my kids ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è, friendly staff. leave your children in safe hands while you are off to work., Excellent curriculum!"

Little Footprints Preschool (Boon Keng),"The school is conveniently located and accessible by both public and private transport. Has their own in-house outdoor play area.

Academically, I have also seen a marked improvement since my girls transferred to this centre.

We saw vast improvement in our kids‚Äô academic and social skills. They feedback that they enjoyed their school time a lot and always look forward for their classes. The teachers are professional and friendly. Highly recommended! üëçüèª ‚Ä¶, My son has been in this school for a year plus and I would say it has been an enriching experience for him. Ever since he joined the school, his communication, social skills and range of vocabulary has greatly improved. The lessons taught in class has also helped in his educational development. Parents were also given weekly updates on what has been taught for that particular week. Special thanks to his teachers (Ms Michele, ËÉ°ËÄÅÂ∏à and Ms Georgina) for their guidance through his learning journey. Also, my experience with Ms Mindy, the school principal is also very pleasant. She is a very friendly lady who always provide timely information as well as professional advises to parents on school related matters., My children have attended LFP since playgroup and they both enjoy it very much. Teachers are sweet and attentive to the children and do their best to accommodate every child‚Äôs needs. My children come home with lots of fun stories to tell about their friends and teachers in school. I really like that the teachers and school principal keep us parents up to date on our children‚Äôs progress in school and the creative initiatives they have to make learning fun for the little ones. I am very thankful for their dedication to the kids :), Best decision ever to had my girl transferred from other Preschool to LFP (Boon Keng). We are so glad to have gotten my child into here and look forward to many years of wonderful development. My child has been with them since playgroup. She absolutely loves the school and the staff.  N2 form teacher, Ms Faya is engaging, lively and energetic. She is patient and encouraging with both kids and parents.  The other teachers are also super sweet and amazing. I‚Äôve never worried about my daughter while she‚Äôs under their care and guidance.  Great environment (with own compound for outdoor play) and very welcoming atmosphere. Academics program is strong as well.  Special thanks to Ms Mindy the principal for the prompt updates of school happenings. We are very satisfied with the measures taken with respect to covid and other spread of viruses., My child has been with LFP Boon Keng since 2 years ago, the teachers are always very passionate, especially in the recent year, Teacher Faya is always very creative in the teaching and great guidance to the children. Liu Lao Shi , Chen Lao Shi, Hu Lao Shi are always very caring.

Massive thanks to everyone in LFP for providing the children with a great learning journey., My boy has been with LFP Boon Keng for a year and I must say I can't thank the teachers and Principal-Mindy enough for their care and love for the students. Teacher Georgina , Hu Lao Shi & Chen Lao Shi has been spectacular and my boy likes them so much. Mindy has always been there to answer my concerns / worries and given me lots of assurance. They are always prompt with their in-app replies and I feel very very assured that my son is in good hands. Thank you to the staff in LFP Boon Keng!, My daughter has been in Little Footprints @Boon keng since she was 5 months old. She enjoyed her time at infant care. Now she is in the PG class and enjoys going to school everyday to see her teachers Ms Georgina and Wu Lao Shi who are extremely caring and loving. I would like to thank Ms Mindy the principal who has taken extra measures to ensure cleanliness and hygiene in the school environment., As first-time parents, we were naturally concerned how well our child would adapt and if the teachers would be able to bond with him. He was enrolled in infant care since 6 months old and recently graduated to the next level. We could tell that the infant care teachers genuinely love the kids. I bump into them occasionally and was told they would still check-in on him in the new class to see how he was doing. I especially like how the school tries to get the next level teachers to stand in where possible, so that the kids get to know their upcoming teachers before going to the next level. LFP Boon Keng is a hidden gem; would totally recommend to anyone staying around the vicinity., My son has been with LFP since Playgroup and over the last 2 years he has progressed in all areas of his development (social, psychomotor and independence). The teachers are passionate about their job and put in extra effort in answering Parent‚Äôs queries and concerns. The principal also has the student‚Äôs interest on priority in making sure that the school is a fun and safe place admidst Covid and other spread of viruses.  Overall an ideal Centre of choice for early childhood development., Educators here are caring, patient and understanding of toddlers. My 2 year old son enjoys school and knows the name of every single classmate. He‚Äôs also more confident and friendly thanks to the great support of all the teachers and staff. Shoutout to his very first teachers Ms Michele and Jing Laoshi (both of whom are no longer at the center) and more recently Ms Rebecca (she‚Äôs super helpful!), Peng Laoshi, aunty Alice and Ms Faya., My son has attended this center for more than a year now. His communication and confidence are improved. The teachers are patient and caring especially Ms Faya, Chen Lause, and Ms Rebecca. The staff also very kind and helpful. Overall we are satisfied with tis center! :), We entrusted LFP (Boon Keng) with our daughter since the middle of 2022. We‚Äôve been very assured by the dedication and care that principal Mindy and her staff have shown., Just put my baby who is 4months old plus in the infant care for 2 weeks. She cried alot at first and thanks to the dedicate teachers especially ms Vim my baby has adapted to the new environment. Vice principal Grace is also very attentive in assuring the best environment that parents can trust and feel at ease when putting children there., Would like to specially thank Ms Grace, ÊùéËÄÅÂ∏à and ÂàòËÄÅÂ∏à. They've been extremely patient, especially when my children are usually the last to be picked up at 7pm. Ms Grace, in particular, is always loving toward my children and helpful to answer our all sort of queries. It feels extremely reassuring to have her around :), Teacher Grace is a wonderful support and patient teacher to help me ease my worries about sending my child to the CC for the first time.. the teachers are kind and understanding... the environment is conductive for learning and playing.. thumb up for the teachers thereüëç ‚Ä¶, Cool and nice environment. Have own compound for outdoor play. Vice president and president very friendly and genuine. I believe my kid will be in good hands., Cosy and caring environment with sound curriculum.

Little Footprints Preschool (Bukit Panjang 546),"We appreciate the teachers take good care and show concerns to our girl, and teach a lot of stuffs to her which benefit to her up growing, plus the teachers are very responsive to any matter which required their attention and clarification.  The group of teachers in Segar Team are very joyful and kind which our girl enjoy going to school everyday.

This means so much to us parents - a happy child who enjoys going to school., Thankful for the teachers in Ichiban Montessori Segar for taking good care of my son and now my daughter too. They are patient also while encouraging the older children to be independent. When the children are slow in eating or crying due to unfamiliar place, they will also try their best to help and console them., Both my girls graduated from Ichiban Segar, they love their teachers. Their curriculum is very good, helps the kids to transit to P1 seamlessly. Thumbs up!, Very friendly and helpful teachers for ichiban centre at segar branch, The teachers are approachable and nice to parents and kids. My kids like the school."
Little Footprints Preschool (Bukit Panjang 631),"My son has enrolled to PG class of Ichiban Montessori (Bukit Panjang 631) since Jan this year.

My girl enjoys school daily. Thank you for making learning fun and enjoyable for the kids. Big shout out to Teacher Devi, Nurul, Kenny and not forgetting Principal Christina. Also to Aunty Jenny for making healthy yummy food for the kids daily."
Little Footprints Preschool (Choa Chu Kang - Limbang),"My child has been attending this pre-school since she was an infant, and I've witnessed the school's various phases of transformation over the years. It's newly renovated and so is the complex in which it's situated. Facilities are clean, new, and updated. The overall quality of this franchise has improved tremendously since it was bought over by a new operator some years back.  What I appreciate: - The school is communicative. The bulk of communication and developmental updates are done through a well-functioning app, which I find more than adequate. They also provide regular developmental and curriculum updates. Inevitable viral outbreaks are well-controlled and well-communicated. Class promotions are well-executed. - The teachers are caring, patient, and chill. I've observed how well the new students adapt; many start initially shy and nervous but develop into confident, happy children. - The school takes a collaborative approach to nurturing the children. We shouldn't be outsourcing our parenting, and I appreciate how this school embraces that. If you're an involved parent and are willing to put in the work, you will find plenty of opportunities to be part of your child's growth. My child is always so happy when I get invited to her school for parties and story-telling. It's worth taking time off work for these occasions. - The curriculum is rich and well-rounded. I have no qualms that my child will be well prepared for the academic rigour of primary school. Heck, she's learning Chinese words that even I can't recognise! She's a confident public speaker due to the myriad of speaking platforms provided by the school. I also like how her Nursery class weaves in current affairs topics, which is awesome in developing societal awareness. - Meals are healthy and nutritious. My child sings praises of Aunty's cooking. She eats stuff that she normally wouldn't eat at home, like brown rice, soft tofu, and seaweed. Oh, the wonders of peer pressure! - The class composition is diverse and inclusive. I love how my child's class is made up of children of different socio-economic and family backgrounds, and with different developmental needs. As a result of her interactions within such a diverse class, my child is growing to be such an adaptable, kind, and empathetic individual. - The kids have scheduled outdoor play time, which is great. A little sun and dirt never hurt any kiddo. I'd appreciate a whole lot more outdoor play time.  Room for improvement: - High turnover: My child has witnessed regular teacher resignations throughout her time here. Not sure if it's due to the competitive external environment or lacklustre talent retention strategies within the group. It's a real pity, because most of her teachers are so capable and competent.  I could write so much more, but you get the drift. I highly recommend this school and trust it will keep up the good work!, The teaching staffs have been the greatest asset to the school.  Whenever I would like to find out updates from the school, I could just ask and it usually would be answered. If there are any issues/happenings during the day that needs to be addressed, teachers would also highlight to me during check out.  Academic wise, I think the school have done a great job. My child comes home and would love to share things like news articles which is part of lesson time to me after school. My child has also learnt to take teachers instructions back and ""remind"" me of things that needs to be done. It think it's a milestone reached for my child.  Despite the school is a little distance away from home, but I would say it is still a great choice!, Made the decision to change our kids‚Äô school to LFP Limbang earlier this year and it was THE BEST DECISION EVER. Caring teachers who make lessons fun, good selection of enrichment classes and most important of all, my kids love their teachers and are excited to go to school which speaks volume. The principal, Ms Melissa is also super prompt in her responses and a good partner to parents. It is hard to leave our young children in school for the whole day but having a school and teachers we trust makes it easier. The weekly photos upload are also much appreciated.  Thank you teachers for all you do!, Thank you teacher sharon and laoshi for your efforts, guidance and dedication in nurturing, caring, and developing interesting lesson plan for muhammad tarmizi lee and his classmates. Really appreciate the difference you made :), The two children have just transferred to this school and they feel it is okay. However, the teacher who picks up the children seldom informs them of their condition."
Little Footprints Preschool (Choa Chu Kang 427),"Both my child attended the childcare services here. The teachers have taken care of them well. Although it's within a HDB block, the environment is clean and conducive. The childcare center at this area is also being awarded SPARK, which is a testament of their quality. I highly recommended Ichiban Montessori 427 CCK to parents. You will be able to leave your kids to the good hands of the staff here with a peace of mind."
Little Footprints Preschool (ITE West),"As parents, we are immensely grateful for the nurturing environment you create within the school walls. Your impact is immeasurable, and we want to take this moment to say a resounding thank you. Your efforts are recognized, valued, and cherished.  Thank you, dear teachers, for all that you do.

Thank you to the PG group teachers in Little Footprints preschool ! ‚ù§Ô∏è, My child truly adores her friends and teachers at LFP (ITE West), and always speaks fondly of them when she's home. If my child is not ready to participate in any activity, the teachers do not force her to, but instead give her time and space to join when she's ready. If I had any concerns (e.g. napping, potty-training), I would not hesitate to reach out to the teachers because they are so approachable and always happy to discuss. The teachers also conscientiously organised parent-child activities in school, as well as excursions to Marina Barrage, Merlion Park, etc. My child loved these experiences outside of the classroom & it also gave us parents the opportunity to meet the teachers, classmates and other parents.  Special shoutout to Teacher Jia Hui, Huang Lao Shi, Teacher Florence, Teacher Siok Teng, Zhang Lao Shi - thank you for your hard work and dedication. We appreciate all that you do!, Teacher Jia Hui you gave our daughter something to look forward to at school.¬†From what we have seen, we believe you genuinely care about our daughter.

Little Footprints Preschool (Jurong West 660),"‚ÄúWe are elated to see the improvement of my daughter over the years. She was nurtured with love and care from the teachers in school. The curriculum in Little Footprints prepared the students for their upcoming challenges in Primary School. The Principal and Teachers put in great effort in their roles and go the extra mile especially during the days of pandemic. Keep up the good job!‚Äù, Our daughter is attending Nursery class in the Jurong West 660 Branch at the year 2022. Her early year is staying in our home town then she don't understand English/Chinese. But after we discussed with Ms.Ang, we decided to send her school. After 4 months school she can communicate with friends and teachers. Teachers and principle have the warm heart and really pay attention on all the children. Teachers always update the child condition and keep in touch with parents. School structure is really good for children cause of there has a lot of windows, can get the fresh air and lighting also good. School send in advance the curriculum for each term, so that we can do home learning activity and enough time to collect the stories book for each term., This is the best childcare preschool üëç I am most impressed with, and even my 6 years old child will tell me that he loves going school everyday @Little Footprints Preschool (660 Jurong West) because he didn‚Äôt like his previous preschool which did not give much guidance to my child when he was in N2 & K1.  From my personal encounters, Little Footprints Preschool @660 Jurong West has a very good Principal, Ms Ang who shows great leadership in leading a team of excellent & most caring teachers from both English & Chinese class.  The teachers truly go the extra miles + good lesson curriculums to help my child improve on his learning for preparation to primary school standards.  I am deeply grateful to the principal & teachers who have put in their utmost efforts in grooming the children and I am most thankful & lucky to have chosen this preschool for my child to to complete K2 which is the last year of his early childhood education.  Thank you to Ms Ang, Teacher Jaiya, Teacher Wang, Teacher Noor, Teacher Xie & Teacher Hazel üëçüëçüëçüëçüëçüëç, I send both my daughters there, and my elder daughter has been with the same school for coming 4 years. My kids enjoy their time in school, the curriculum is interesting, with many types of activities daily. Updates are sent frequently via the school app. Most importantly, the teachers are passionate on what they do, and truly cares for my daughters., Sent my 2 girls to this Little Footprints Jurong West, my number 3 is going soon too. They have a good principal who‚Äôs very helpful to all my questions and responses timely. Keeping me worry-free at work. My kids love their teachers too. Thank you and Happy Teachers Day! üåπ ‚Ä¶, It was by leap of faith that my girl was enrolled in Little Footprints (Jurong West 660 branch). We were searching around our vicinity for a childcare centre when I (Mummy) came across this cute-looking uniform that LFP has. I contacted Ms Ang (The principal) and arranged for a visit to the centre and the rest is history.  My girl started her Pre-nursery life with the centre from year 2021, when she was 2.5 years old. The principal and teachers took great effort and patience to help her adapt to school, keeping us updated constantly for the 1st few weeks as she settled down. Within the year, we saw how Roanne grew to be more independent (able to take charge of herself e.g. getting dressed, potty-trained) and gained a lot more knowledge.  As my girl progressed to Nursery in 2022, we'd see her develop so much more, be it emotionally as she connects better with her classmates (having best friends!) and intellectually (the knowledge just keeps growing!). I specially like the ""Tick tock, Time to talk"" sessions the centre introduced. It helps to build confidence in the children when they speak in front of an audience, which will prove useful as they progressed further in life.  One of the many aspects I like about centre is how engaging/attentive the principal and teachers are. We, parents are kept updated with the ongoings in school and our queries are always answered. This is something which we appreciate a lot. All in all, I'm glad the cute-looking uniform brought me to LFP (Jurong West 660)., Thank you for a truly wonderful year. My son and daughter truly have a great time and learned so much. They make friends with other children and become more independent. Thank you for the professionalism, nurturing and dedication and the warm welcoming environment every day!, Thank you to the teachers of little footprints preschool for caring and dedicated teaching for my childrens to improve day by day. ü•∞ü•∞ ‚Ä¶, My children are well taken care off.

Day after day, we see our eldest grow into a young lady, shaped with core values, confidence, and kindness and our youngest coming home each day happy with eyes brighten and a smile always ready to greet us.  We see slowly but surely that foundation for life skills is slowly shaped and stands firm in both of them.  Shaped by educators who share the same values as us.

Teachers provide timely feed back about the kid, and they are open to have conversations with you at pick up time, they don't seems to be rushing you out at all.  Overall the school makes me feel very relaxed and cozy like a family, kids all know each other from different classes, they chat, laugh and play together, you see happy kids not robots when picking them up.

She has no problems n loves going to school. She's a fast learner. She likes to talk only things she doesn't remember her teachers n her peers name.

Thank you so so so much.  Mummy Vanessa, I have enrolled my daughter to start the school in January next year and had to withdraw her with 1 month notice given due to personal reason. The Principal, Ms Jenny, demanded that I have to let go both registration fee and 50% of the school fee which was not what she said on the phone when we communicated. She only mentioned about the registration fee being forfeited. No form or details were emailed to me but only the details of the UEN number and subsidies form to get the procedures going. She was not only unhelpful but rude at the same time. Prior to me enrolling into the school, I went down for a school tour which she said she will be the one doing but I was given a tour by a teacher who is leaving the school hence no information about enrolment was given as well. I find it ridiculous that I have to pay 50% of the school fee when my child haven't even started school and I gave 1 and a half month notice before withdrawing my enrolment. I hope the management will do something about this and if this fits their SOP., I would like to say thank you to teacher Haydee and Chen Lao Shi for k2 class Punggol beach . Always the lovely teacher to the kids and share a lot of knowledge and couragement. My daughter enjoy to go to school Everyday !, Thank you Zhao lao shi, Ai Li lao shi and Teacher Nisa for taking good care of Lisa (K1).

Being a sensitive child, your presence makes Jeryl feel very comfortable and looking forward to school. He always mention about you at home, this goes to show how much he loves you!  Dear Teacher Zhao, Thank you for your concern and love for Renjie. Renjie‚Äôs Chinese has also improved greatly because of your careful teaching. At first, he was completely unwilling to communicate in Chinese and could not understand Chinese very well. Although he doesn't speak fluently now, he can understand and communicate in Chinese! He can also sing some songs you taught at home, and tell me the books you taught them to read, so that I can also Go buy him a copy.  Dear Teacher Anli, Thank you for your attention and care for Renjie when you were a teaching assistant at K1. He often mentions Teacher Anli, and he likes Teacher Anli very much. He also said that he would invite you to his home as a guest!  To Miss Janet and all other teachers & staff, Through collegiality, the synergy in Little Footprints plays a vital role in Jeryl's holistic development.

Little Footprints Preschool (Sengkang 439),"Ichiban Montessori is a gem.  After trying various schools around Sengkang, it was a blessing to finally find a permanent child care for our little one. Ichiban Montessori is really a hidden treasure worth finding.  It was not obvious at first, given that the school doesn't splurge on Marketing and Advertisement and being located in a quiet neighborhood, but the people inside made all the difference. From the cleaners, food assistants, assistant teachers, teachers and  principal, and students, all of them contributes to give the best experience to all children at all levels, even us parents.  Nothing too fancy, just the experience of belonging to a close family. This is what really matters. To all the teachers and staff of Ichiban Montessori, happy Teacher's day., Not a good experience with the school.  Principal became from 100-0 the moment i told her i will withdraw my kids from the centre.  My boy was hit on the face while playing, apparently nothing from the teachers to inform of the incident until i had to text and ask.  Pick up is always super slow, had to wait more then 10mins sometimes, As Teachers‚Äô Day is round the corner, I would like to thank all the wonderful teachers at Ichiban Montessori Sengkang Branch for their hard work and selfless dedication to my 2 girls. When my K1 girl could tell me everything that happened in school with excitement, I know how much she enjoyed her time there; hence bringing peace of mind for me when I am at work. I trust that the teachers and school will continue to deliver quality curriculum and character building programmes for my kids. Happy Teachers‚Äô Day!, My child has been with Ichiban Montessori Sengkang since IFC and he‚Äôs now in N1. I was sharing with my wife that I‚Äôm so grateful that our son is in Ichiban.  It may not be the biggest childcare compared to surrounding ones, but the vibes of love and care for our child can be genuinely felt by us, that we want him to continue enjoying his growth there.  Being a year end baby, we were initially concerned about whether our son can catch up, but teachers‚Äô assurance gave us confidence and we have seen his progress, surprising us many times.  Many thanks to Ms Pave, Arthur‚Äôs class teachers He Laoshi and Teacher Genny for helping his growth and caring for him, not forgetting Teacher May, Teacher Kris, Teacher Mas, Li Laoshi, educarers during his infant days Teacher Alam and Teacher Teh, including the aunties that prepare the delicious meals and clean areas for the little ones!  Happy Teachers Day!, Thank you for the great experience you have created for my son. He has come back home with so much happiness everyday. Miss Pave has always gone beyond to answer any queries and been very accomodating to us. She and the Infant care teachers have been very assuring and always open to communication. It has been a very place for our son to be at while we we are at work in ease. Thank you so much to the excellent team for spreading joy and positivity to the infants . We are extremely appreciative and thankful for Kiyan to be at Ichiban.  Love, Ms Thana, You will first be welcomed by their friendly Principal who is very approachable. She listens and understands the concerns I have as a first time mum, who also shares her thoughts and experience with me, assuring me that things will be fine. She definitely gives me a lot of confident even before sending my child to the centre. Ever since my child started PG with the centre, she has improved a lot in many aspects, like she's more interactive, she follows teachers' instructions (placing her shoes on the rack etc), she learns to sing songs and she's able to hold the spoon and eat her lunch independently. I'm very thankful to have found a centre with a team of wonderful teachers, especially He Laoshi who has shown passion and patience in caring for the children. Without anyone of them, my child will never become who she is today. P/S, centre aunties cook yummy porridge for the children too. Always smell it when passing by from their kitchen :P. Good job to the team of professionals., Neighborhood located. Teachers are very motherly towards the kids. My girl learnt a lot of things here and can speak well Chinese ever since attending to the school... The teachers are pretty patient to each individual child. The only down side is maybe consider a bit of renovation to beautify their premises and may be can ask the teachers to some parents about updates., Do not recommend this center. Hardly have any communication from the teacher. My kid was always being picked up or sent out at the door by an aunty. Do not expect teacher to be there to share with you anything about your kid. Claim that they have lots of different activities. However, when my mother was there, she spotted that their outdoor time was less than 15 minutes and teacher just busy taking picture (probably to post on their facebook to show the parents they do their job). Have withdrawn my kid from the center after he was there for 2 months. With this school fee, there are definitely other better center around that area., A fine child care that serves the local community. With its sufficient space and facilities, it's serves as a child care well. Despite some complains about safety and some staff members, it is still a well run child care Centre that is awarded by ecda., Bad service and poor quality care for the kids."
Little Footprints Preschool (Ubi),"Teachers & staff are very attentive and genuine when handling students. My daughter has been attending this childcare since she was 3.5 months old and she has been receiving so much care and love from all the staff. Ms. Tina, the school principal and all the teachers keep the parents informed with all the updates about my daughter's well-being. When Covid-19 hit, we are also kept informed all the time when there are cases or new regulations. Kudos to the team and thank you for your hard work! :), Not really recommended this preschool after i heard from my niece and nephew who have been in this school for years. The turnover of teacher is high, already 4 or 5 teacher came and go this year. The teacher tend to put the child they cannot managed to another class for whole day, so that it wont affect the lesson in class, but the unfortunate child will missed all the lesson in own class. Not a right way to manage and the quality of teacher should be improved., We can see our child thoroughly enjoys going to school. He often mentions excitedly that his teachers taught him arts and craft, yoga, songs etc. Most of the teachers from other classes also know our son by name, which shows how attentive the teachers are. Given that we have seen significant improvement in our son, we would like to applaud the professional staff for their great efforts!, LFP Ubi have opened our eyes to a whole new fun way of learning. Our child enjoyed her many years here growing up, feeling loved and always ready to take up a new challenge. She is able to mix witg kids of all ages and learn to care for everyone around her. Never regretted sending her regardless how we needed to travel every morning. She learned the most greatest lessons here: Love, Care, Compassion and the eagerness to Learn, The Teachers and Principal been really kind and patient. Both my son and daughter been with them since 3 months old and 2 years old. Even the aunty who cooks for them and the Admin lady been really nice and friendly. Overall everyone there are just so helpful and positive. Makes me and my husband feel safe to leave our children there. Thank you!, All the teachers in this school are really helpful and passionate about the children's welfare. They truly care and show concern for the children. I must say Ms Anna, Ms Ifah and Â∞öËÄÅÂ∏à have helped in encouraging all their little charges with their real love to teach., Thank you to all the IFC teachers at Ubi for taking such great care of the babies. It can be overwhelming when babies start crying together. I am glad my boy is there with teachers I know. And to teachers from PG to PN and currently Nur class that my older son is in, thank you for going an extra mile and making effort to interact with him and understanding his needs. Thank you!, Teachers are very nurturing and genuine. Little Footprints have a good curriculum team and syllabuses are pitched very appropriately. My children often share about fond and loving memories of their teachers and friends., We love the school as teachers care the kids, and teachers will distribute homework so that parents can help kids for their study. We have been changing schools but this is the one we will let children stay. Thanks., My child just turned 18 months old when circuit breaker was over in July 2020. We made the decision to get him started in Playgroup even though we were concerned about health and safety. Our experience with LFP since my son started far exceeded our expectations. They constantly provided assurance of our child's safety and wellbeing. Most importantly, my child loves going to school every day. Thank you LFP!!!, Nice environment and learning kits for kids. And teachers are caring and thoughtful. Teachers also provides kids progress and updates weekly/fortnight (comments and photos) to parents. Kids are happy to return to class everytime., Great place for your children to learn and grow! Great staff! Loving and caring - LPUbi, Thank you Ms Dhiyah and Zhang Laoshi at Ubi Centre for taking such good care of my girl. I can see the genuine love and care that all teachers have for Heidi. :), Thank you  Â∞öËÄÅÂ∏à for your patience and care towards Charisse all these years. Happy Teacher Day., The teachers are truly dedicated in teaching and caring for the children. Keep up the good work!"

Thank you & happy Teacher‚Äôs Day!, Our first born has been improving tremendously in terms of speech, behaviour etc ever since he started going to school in January 2023.  We are so proud of him and we also appreciate the teachers' efforts to educate the children so well.  They are constantly updating us face to face or in the school app and keeping us in the loop. That's great accountability for us parents as well.  We have also paid for and secured a placement for our second born to attend school in 2024. That is how much we love the school's culture, the way they run the programmes and we even look into finer details like food menu etc.  All in all, thank you Teacher Jolyn Sim & Teacher Willy Rose Bacus!, Love the vibe and the energy. Special thanks to Ms Rose and Shen laoshi for taking good care of Noah. We really appreciate the constant update and more importantly ensuring his development and wellbeing. And also to the rest of the teachers, thank u !, We are so happy that both Leia and Leona are enjoying in school. It‚Äôs not easy to send Leona to school as she started in her 18mths where Leia started during her infant. However seeing them preparing themselves every morning makes it a breeze, we know that we have make the right choice sending them to little footprints at woodgrove. We know we have you to thank the teachers and principal for that.

Thank you so much!, I would like to express my gratitude to all the teachers at Little Footprints (LFP) Woodgrove. The teachers are really passionate about each child‚Äôs education. I have seen my daughter‚Äôs confidence grow over the years whilst she‚Äôs at LFP. From a shy and soft spoken child, she is now confident in expressing her opinions and able to communicate clearly.  The teachers encourage my daughter to read and write, and that it‚Äôs fine to make mistakes. My daughter has enjoyed her time at LFP, and looks forward going to childcare everyday to see her friends and teachers.  I would like to call out Ms Firza, she is an excellent teacher and adapts her teaching style and method according to the child‚Äôs ability and personality - thank you!

Mr and Mrs Ho, Thank you Principal and Teachers of Little Footprints (Cedarwood Grove). My daughter will be graduating from K2 this year end and going to P1 in 2021. I have watched her growth and development over the years, to be curious and engaged in her learning. She gets much mental and physical stimulation through active learning offered in school. Also, as a mother, I had many opportunities to be part of her learning through enjoyable activities and working with her on her weekly book reviews and workbooks over the weekend.

Little Footprints Preschool (Woodlands 877),"My children has been with this childcare since young and my elder child is graduating this year. The teachers are awesome & extremely caring for the children. They really treat the children like their own children and not like just any other jobs. My daughter was transferred from another children previously and the standards are quite different whereby the previous childcare teachers were like robots & just like doing their job without much love. Special shoutout to teacher Jane, Eunice, Nadia for being the most caring teachers and my children really look forward to going to the school because of them. And also the cleaning auntie (Sorry I've forgotten your name as I'm bad with names) who is also very caring for the kids and I can see that she does her job with love, cleaning up the child care centre that is so clean!  The rest of the teachers are equally as as awesome! If I have to list something that is below my expectation, I can hardly have any and if I really have to, my only disappointment is that this year's graduation isnt a live concert but a virtual one., We would like to express our much heartfelt appreciation to Ms Yvette and all the teachers especially Tr Nadia (K2) in this centre for their warmth, love and patience for our special need son in supporting his education and journey in the school.

At the time of registration my 2 little girls, Veronica Shalini (4 yrs old) and Nageshwary (3 yrs old) were very fearful of their surrounding and shy to look up at strangers.  Mdm Zahara gave us the assurance that she and her teachers will work hard to help these kids grow up with confidence and be  knowledgeable.   She is always with a smiling face and shows that she is willing to listen to our concerns and give a helping hand. Now the 2 kids are in the 3 rd Term, and I can see improvement in their confidence level. This is itself a great achievement to the school and the teachers. PLEASE KEEP UP THE GOOD WORK  Weili Luo (Teacher) She is a Chinese Language Teacher and trying her level best to teach my 2 Kids the language. I feel that she has somehow succeeded in her effort because sometimes the kids prompt a few words in the language. I think she is doing a great job and I must thank her foe her effort. The 2 kids have earned her trust and the school environment  and are always willing to go to school.  Normah Junid (Teacher)  Veronica Shalini was having speech problem and her words are not clear. She is also the shy type. With Mdm Normah's willingness to teach and her positive  approach has helped this child to come out from the shell. She can now speak in sentences and her Gross Motor Skills and Fine Motor Skills has improved quite a bit. The 2 kids have earned her trust and the school environment  and are always willing to go to school.  Conclusion (To the Principal and all the Teachers)  Thanks for your patience and for the quality care you provide each and every day.

Specially to Teacher Ang, Teacher Sonia and Zhao Laoshi, thank you so much for your love, patience and guidance towards my children. ""A teacher plants the seeds of knowledge, sprinkles them with love and patiently nurtures their growth to produce tomorrow's dreams!"", I would like to Thank the principal Ms Zahara.  She was patient with my request and prompt to reply after we were put on waiting list.  She has also been very supportive and always willing to lend a listening hear.  Another Must Thank Teacher is Ms Karren.  My daughter, Leora K2 has not been an easy to handle child when she started Little Footprints 2017, she was very uncooperative and timid during the first few months.  In fact she suffered serious separation anxiety issues.  Ms Karren was always calm and assuring with her, giving her the extra attention she needed.  After less than three months, she won the trust of my girl and she was slowly able to enjoy coming to school.  As Leora has learning difficulties and AHD, it is an uphill task to make her sit and listen and learn.  Ms Karren was able to achieve the above while being assertive and assuring with Leora.  Leora has also grown to be more out-spoken and importantly confident after two years....all these possible only with love and care displayed by Ms Zahara, Ms Karren and also her K2 Chinese teacher Luo LaoShi.  Luo LaoShi has made learning chinese fun with songs and dance.  Kudos to the three Wonderful ladies, Thank you all the teachers. Specially Thanks to teacher Yani, Peng lao shi and teacher Tan for the guidance of my girl. Thanks Ms Sharon too., Thank you teacher for taking care well of Xuefu from PN. ^^"
Little Footprints Preschool Group Pte Ltd (140 Bishan Street 12),"I visited the school in end Aug‚Äô23 and met principal Angeline Mah for a school visit as I had intended to enroll my child in LFP bishan. It was a very enriching experience. Angeline took me through the school and explained the different classes and the school ciriculumn.  While the facilities are standard, I would like to applaud Angeline and her team of teachers as I could see the passion, as well as love for teaching to the children.

It felt like a very safe space to put my child in. Thank you to your team for the hard work you do.

Little Footprints Preschool Pte Ltd (Jurong East 248),"My child was a picky eater when she was younger and her weight was quite low. But after joining LFP, she has been more open to different kinds of food and the teachers told me that she is a great eater! She is now at a healthy weight. She is also more willing to express herself with words and I believe the teachers have trained her well in handling her emotions. The teachers are very compassionate and patient too. Good effort from the teachers in LFP!, Heartfelt Thanks for Exceptional Care and Education by Little Footprints Preschool (Blk 248 Jurong East)  Dear Ms Susan and HQ Little Footprints,  I am writing to express my deepest gratitude to Principal, Ms Susan and her dedicated team of teachers & staff especially Ms Jude and Zhang ËÄÅÂ∏à at Little Footprints Preschool for the outstanding care and education provided to my daughter, En Qi.  I am truly impressed by the thoughtful curriculum planning and the immense effort that goes into creating a nurturing environment for the children. It is evident that the passion for education and genuine care for each child's well-being are at the core of Little Footprints. I recalled in one of the instances which was the Mid Autumn Festival 2023, I was truly impressed with the immense effort and care displayed by Ms Susan and her team of teachers & staff to dress up as Chang Er and Hou Yi to perform for the kids. This will help them understand the festival origins and why we need to celebrate the festival which is very important. They have also planned games and songs for us as parents to interact with the kids. I recalled this occasion fondly because I remembered that day was the hottest day in the month which temperatures soar to 36/37 degrees celsius. Despite that, they did not show any unhappiness but instead putting on their sweetest smiles and effort to guide and celebrate with the students on the festivities despite wearing thick costumes and head gear.  Apart from the above, my daughter, En Qi has not only thrived academically but has also developed valuable social and emotional skills under the guidance of your exceptional team. Your commitment to fostering a positive and stimulating learning environment has made a lasting impact on her, and we are grateful for the positive experiences she has gained.  Please extend our appreciation to Principal, Ms Susan and her team of teachers & staff especially Ms Jude and Zhang ËÄÅÂ∏à whom have played a crucial role in her growth and development. Their dedication and enthusiasm do not go unnoticed, and we are fortunate to have such a remarkable team shaping the foundation of our child's early education.  Once again, thank you to Ms Susan, her team of teachers and staff in Little Footprints Preschool (Blk 248 Jurong East) for your unwavering commitment to providing a high-quality education and a caring atmosphere. We feel fortunate to be part of the Little Footprints Preschool community. If possible, please do reward them so that they will be motivated to stay longer in this school as such early childhood educators are very hard to come by these days.  Warm regards,  En Qi Papa and Mummy, The teachers' patience, kindness, and ability to create a warm and inviting atmosphere have truly made a positive impact on our child's growth. We are grateful for the group of exceptional teachers as well as the school‚Äôs principal Ms Susan and wholeheartedly recommend them to any parent seeking a nurturing and enriching educational environment for their little ones.

I learned that she has serious separation anxiety and took almost a month to settle in. The teachers were nurturing and patient to guide her into the school routine. Even though she still cries at check in today, she has improved tremendously for this separation anxiety issue, and would even tell me she did not cry sometimes.  She also started off as a sole mandarin speaker during PG times and kudos to Mdm Maimon's guidance and patience, she could understand English instructions now. After the transition to PN, she can speak simple english now, thanks to Ms Kar Yin's patience in teaching her.  She has since adjusted and adapted to the school that made us continue her preschool journey here despite having moved to our BTO in the east. Great job LFP teachers! Happy Teachers' Day!, My elder daughter first started preschool at LFP in July 2020 (was called Bright Juniors back then). She managed to settle down in school within two weeks, which is not surprising given that her then-PG teachers had such a vibrant and outgoing personality! Also, I could see my girl‚Äôs transformation when she started verbalizing her thoughts just a few weeks into school! Before school, she only could say simple words.  I was also impressed with the thoughtfulness of the school in several levels: 1. In helping the children transit from PG/PN class to Nursery, there was an intimate handover, and tailored plan to help the children adapt to a relatively more ‚Äúacademic‚Äù focused curriculum, with writing classes, potty training etc.  2. The teachers are also very meticulous in caring for the children, for example they shared tips with me on how to help my daughter overcome the fear of showering her hair when they noticed such an issue. Even the non-teaching staff has much love for the kids. The aunty (responsible for cooking the meals and cleaning) also showed concern on my girl‚Äôs eczema condition and expressed her heartache when she saw the wounds while bathing her. I really appreciate the love showered on my kids.  3. The teachers put in a lot of effort in decorating the school, and dressing themselves and the children up, during festive seasons or special celebrations. During the recent reading week, my daughter‚Äôs teacher dressed as tinker bell, Jasmine (from Aladdin), red riding hood, Snow White, etc (just to name a few) to engage the children. This made school so fun and enjoyable, and my daughter came home sharing how she wanted to be a princess too!  4. The vitamin C lessons taught my children to be a better person than they could be. My elder daughter was facing difficulties coping with the birth of her baby brother. The teachers helped to guide her in celebrating her new brother‚Äôs presence! Recently, the kids also displayed motivation in ‚Äúbeing helpful‚Äù at home from these lessons.  Hence, when it‚Äôs time for my younger son to start school this year, I immediately enrolled him to LFP! I couldn‚Äôt be more grateful to meet such a dedicated team of early childhood educators in my children‚Äôs learning journey. thank you teachers, and happy teachers day!, My children had great experiences at the preschool especially with a few Teachers who are able to engage them & are very encouraging. They did a superb job for the first ever K2 virtual graduation ceremony with a stage decorated with beautiful background, kids trained to do nice dance moves, great editing video skills & emcee hosting skills. They often set up very fun activities & games during festive celebration & also fun indoor programs  as well. My kids also highly praised the yummy food cooked by the kitchen auntie which make every meal very enjoyable for them., Grateful to the teachers for going the extra mile in caring for the kids, spending long hours in school and even after office hours. Heartfelt thanks especially to Ms Kar Yin, Ms Jude, Âº†ËÄÅÂ∏àÔºåÊùéËÄÅÂ∏àÔºåas well as the non-teaching staff for nurturing my child with love and patience!, My girl starts her PG at LFP Jurong East mid of this year. Mdm Maimon and Âº†ËÄÅÂ∏à are her teachers. After she start her school for around 1.5 mths, I can see her change. Start to talk more although some words I don't understand, more willing to drink from straw and start to know how to pull down her pants and diapers by her own. Thank you teachers. Happy Teacher's Day ÊïôÂ∏àËäÇÂø´‰πê, I am in awe the way my daughter is learning at Little footprints school.

Little Footprints Preschool Pte Ltd (Punggol 168),"All my 3 kids went to/ currently in Little Footprints 168D Punggol.  When my firstborn started in year end of 2015 in PG, it was honestly just another childcare to us. It was only in 2016 when the new principal came on board that we saw what a difference the leader makes. With the now-ex principal, she took many initiatives, all for the well-being of not only the kids, but for the young parents like us as well. She constantly kept us updated of our kids' progress over whatsapp. Its truly a blessing to be able to receive pictures of the little ones periodically as they learn in school, many milestones which we, working parents, will miss due to us working.  The reminders over WhatsApp on happenings in school, such as festive celebrations, fees deadlines etc were also welcoming as there are many of us who are really not as responsive on emails/ app platforms.  The environment in school was a welcoming one, with a sense of belonging for children. I knew the teachers well - you can sense they genuinely love the children and this the children reciprocate it back in return. My wife and I gave raving reviews about this school whenever the topic of childcare came up. The principal and her team were invested in the well being and growth of the children, not only academically. There were so many excursions, parent-child bonding activities etc planned that we were a part of. And also allowed for parents to know each other, forming an informal parent support group ourselves.  However, all this ended in July 2022 when the principal left, and there was such a high turnover of teachers. Half or more of my youngest child's class had left due to the instability of the centre.  Communication with the school now becomes generic. Only via the official platform, where children's updates  are now slow/ non existent. Previously, height/weight is periodically recorded. Now, the last update was half a year ago.  I dropped off my kids and see now the school is no longer as inviting as before. There is hardly any artwork of kids decorating the school premises, no more birthday babies' of the month pictures greeting you at the entrance etc.  The centre has now become jus another business, where everything is transactional and reactive. Complaints get replied to with generic responses.  An educator is more than just a business. I hope the management can relook into your processes. You once had a great team, there is a big shoe to fill. At least be open to feedback from parents - not jus dealing blindly with the feedback from parents and refusing to acknowledge it. I am sure statistics don't lie, look at your student withdrawals turnover rate of staff, they should tell you alot., I am glad to enrol my two sons into LFP 168 punggol branch. Ms Nai and her team of teachers take pride in their job for being compassionate, patient and caring towards the children in the centre.  Special thanks to Ms Nai for providing a friendly and safe environment for our children to learn and grow. Also, thank you for being strict about our children‚Äôs safety and for providing updates and reminders to parents constantly.  Special thanks to teacher min, teacher berina, teacher Lina and Luo Lao shi for providing quality care to my sons and playing an active role in my children‚Äôs growth and education!, My two kids really enjoy the time in school.Every staff in Punggol 168D is very kind, principal Ms Nai is reachable at any time even public holiday.My Son was with teacher Lynn about two and half years,I really appreciate her help on my Son, she not only take care of student‚Äôs study, also the development of personality. Ms Tini is very warming, we like to see her smile in morning upon enter school.Âº†ËÄÅÂ∏àis very hardworking,Teacher Min,Ms Lina ,teacher Xuefang and ÁΩóËÄÅÂ∏àis very nice and easygoing. Thanks to all Teachers, The Principal Ms Nai is very detailed with all aspects of running the school, be it our Children‚Äôs education, well-being, or character  building. Really appreciate all the updates and reminders she send us on school matters, and all on her own accord.  I would like to mention Teacher Lynn as well, she is a loving teacher who teaches my child English and Maths. She really cares about our children‚Äôs progress and their personalities.  Another teacher to mention is Zhang lao shi who teaches Chinese in K2. She is also a loving teacher who genuinely cares about the Children and their upbringing.  Overall, I am grateful to the teachers and staff of this school, and that both my children had a chance to attend this school and have the experience that they did. Well done to all!, An awesome centre, with a team passionate about nurturing kids. I have 3 kids all enrolled with LFP punggol 168D, in PG, PN and K2 currently.  LFP wasn't the first school for all my kids -(they attended infant care elsewhere and up to PG for my first two kids), I can see the difference in quality of the team and the impact it has on my children. Things really took a change for the better after Ms Nai took over as the principal, the curriculum improved with more involvement of the kids in activities outside of just academic subjects. I appreciated the excursions that the school arranged, creating wonderful and unforgettable memories for my children.  The team that made such a difference in our lives:  Tr Lynn - my son's favourite teacher, who seen him grow from PN to K2 now. Âº†ËÄÅÂ∏à also helped my son to develop such great interest in Chinese language.  Tr Min, Tr Lina and ÁΩóËÄÅÂ∏à of PN did an exceptional job with my daughter. Thank you for your patience and affection.  Ms Tini, whom I observe, to never fail to greet all the kids and parents with a warm smile.  Even Tr Angeline, who has only started taking care of my youngest boy since August. I was impressed that she took effort to make a personal call to me before my boy started school, simply just to understand his preferences, medical history and all, rather than filling out a generic form.  Thank you to the dedicated team at LFP Punggol 168D. You are all a blessing to both children and parents!, Great team of teachers in LFP. Would like to say a BIG thank you to all of you for all the hard work and dedication.

Beside a very good foundation curriculum that offers in school, I like the December K2 Primary 1 preparation curriculum that my eldest boy attended last year.

So it makes the kids easy to adapt to the school environment easier. My children are looking forward to go to school everyday, My gal in K1 and boy in PN are both in LFP.

There is also weekly Chinese homework and on top of that, the kids can borrow a book home from school to read, then write or draw about what they have learned from the story.

Little Footprints Preschool Pte Ltd (Yishun 865),"My kid attended pre-nursery and is currently in nursery here. In terms of the care and education provided, I think it's pretty decent. I can definitely see an improvement in terms of speech, vocabulary and basic knowledge of things. They may not follow the lesson plans 100%, but they do fill the time with meaningful activities so I'm fine in this aspect. The teachers are caring and you can see that they do connect with the kids rather than just going to school and treating it like an everyday job. There's room for improvement in terms of general administration but overall a decent school for the kids., I have two kids who are currently enrolled at Little footprint yishun block 865. Everytime when my kids returned from school, they are always very eager to share what they had done during curriculum. I am very pleased to see my two girls who were once very shy and now able to speak and sing songs very confidently. I strongly believe the teachers have put in so much effort in building up my girl‚Äôs confidence level.  I have to add on that all the teachers in that center will greet me and my husband so well during the time I send and fetch my girls (makes us feel safe to send my kids there haha). Teachers and the principal have portrayed a very good image for this school and I will strongly recommend my friends and family who is living around that area to send their future kids there!, My experience with the teachers in the school has always been very pleasant and positive. Teachers are mindful of their expectations; carrying out their duties well in every aspect and always putting in that extra effort to make lessons fun and very interactive!  Special mention to teachers from Nursery class ( Teacher Nadra & Liang Laoshi) for displaying care and concern through your daily interactions (outdoor experiential learning / in class lessons) with the kids!

Little Gems Preschool@Redhill,
Little Green House @ Aljunied,"This school is a haven of care and learning for our child. Within weeks, he settled in and embraced the nurturing atmosphere. The dedication of Principal Ms. Yana and the teachers shines through. Their regular updates keep us involved in his growth journey, and the top-notch security measures ensure his safety., Super bad experience with this school. I will definitely choose 0 star if the option is here! The teachers are not well trained to take care of baby. Please think twice before sending baby to there. They will do crazy things to your baby to suffer ( especially if your baby is unable to verbalise) Teachers always tell lie and pretend they were busy. They can‚Äôt get a lot of toddlers coz their service is very bad. With this school fee, you can get much better service than their one. The principal, MS YANA is not professional. She is super good at collecting money but will ignore you after that and always find reasons to cover their mistake and service failure! I made the comment 3 weeks ago and today found suddenly lots of good comments come out subsequently. Well done!, It‚Äôs very terrible school. They just want to collect money and will not care you. My baby was mistreated by the teacher there and they refused to investigate. At the end, we have to escalate the case to Ecda for investigation. The principal Yana even mentioned her school assistant English teacher English capability is not good to talk to parents. Such kind of ridiculous excuse. Really very horrible school I must say!, Don‚Äôt recomended to send ur child to this school,my baby last at infant care on september but there still deduct from my account on october,how ur procecsing luckly i check from my account,if i don‚Äôt check until when u will stop to deduct ?Now november ready i have‚Äôn get back my money (deposite 1,680+370=$2,050)üëé about take care baby also don‚Äôt professional always change teacher if u guys have choice go far away from this school but for me that times i no choice, My daughter looks forward to go to school here. The school is well cleaned and the teachers are very nice and caring. I recommend LGH@ Aljunied if are looking for a school for your little one in this area., they give me regular updates and insights into my child's activities and development help me stay connected even when I'm not physically there., Children here are very happy to come to school. They always have fun activities and teachers are very loving to the children., They focus on educational play and this ensures that my little one is not only entertained but also learning valuable skills., Their stringent security measures and well-maintained facilities put my mind at ease knowing my child is in good hands., Committed and compassionate educators and principal.

Initially he was upset because of separation anxiety, but after weeks, he slowly got use to going to school. He seems to like it a lot, as he is always excited to go in the morning.  Another review mentioned the finance and logging system. They are now using an app for finance and communication with parents., Good place to learn. The teachers are caring and responsible!, Curriculum is age appropriate and teachers are generally kind and caring. One down side is their administrative and finance departments are in a mess. They log in payments using a logbook and do not issue receipts on the spot. I had an incident in 2019 with them that came back to bite me still up till today. I have always been prompt with payments but one day, they told me they missed out one month‚Äôs collection (prob like 6 months ago) so my most recent months‚Äô payment are then one month lagging. ie May payment was for April, April was for March, etc etc until the missing month. 2 years after we left the school, the ‚Äúcredit department‚Äù sent me an SMS demanding for payment or risk legal fees borne by myself. You can try out this school for the environment and teachers, just keep your own records of payments. If anyone has such incidents, feel free to contact me and let‚Äôs see what we can do., Send my kid for two weeks. Had very bad experience.

Little Green House @ Sin Ming,
Little Green House @ Tampines,"I wholeheartedly recommend this preschool to any parent looking for a nurturing, educational, and joyful environment for their children. We have sent all three of our kids to LGH@ Tampines!  The teachers at this school are exceptional. Not only are they highly skilled educators, but they also genuinely care for each and every student. It's heartwarming to see the level of attention, care, and concern they provide to the children. They create a nurturing and stimulating environment that makes learning enjoyable.  One of the best indicators for us is how excited and happy our kids are to go there every day. Their enthusiasm speaks volumes about the engaging and enriching experiences they're having. It is very reassuring as a parent to know that our kids are in good hands!  Thank you LGH@ Tampines :), Both of my girls have been attending LGH Tampines since they were 18 mths old. The teachers were attentive and not only does the school emphasize on the academic aspect but they also focus on the students‚Äô physical well being. There were lots of outdoor activity and excursions were being organized which really help to develop the kids gross motor skills., LGH @ Tampines provided a safe environment for my child to learn and grow at her own pace. Over the years, she gained more confidence. True to its brand, my child is able to speak, read and write well. The teachers are understanding and nurturing. They constantly update the parents not only in terms of academics but also their social well being. They weathered the storm during the unprecedented COVID period which is really commendable., My son started N1 in this school in Feb this year. I feel at ease that he is in this school.  It's a lovely place!  Teachers are nice and communicates well with parents. Staffs are friendly too.  I also noticed that my son falls sick less often in this school.  If you are looking for a place for your child in this area, I highly recommend you stop in for a tour., I had a super hard time finding schools for my youngest around Tampines since she was a newborn. Tried my luck applying at LGH Tampines when she was around 13 months (although the school accepts 18mths for Pre-N), and was delighted to hear from them within few weeks! The Principal was very willing to answer my queries and was responsive as well. When my daughter started her Pre-N journey in May this year, she had a hard time adjusting to the environment, but her teachers were very patient during her transition period. She has finally adjusted and is enjoying her time in school!, In a desperate need of finding a school for my children, the school principal has helped me to get my children a place in the centre. After 7 months of my children enrolling in this school, I have seen improvements in their language as well as emotional development. The stories that my 5 year old come home to tell me assures me that the teachers as well as the cook and cleaner care for the children well. I am pleased that my children are being placed in a safe place for them to express themselves as well as gain good communication skills and their social emotional needs are met. Would totally recommend this school to others! üëçüèª, Ms Melissa has managed LGH @ Tampines well.

My kids are very happy attending school there., Dear Teachers,  Posting on behalf of my wife - Since the twins first started out in LGH way back in 2018 till to-date (they will be graduating from LGH this year), it has been a wonderful journey for them filled with constant learning, guidance, discipline from the great teachers in the centre. Each of the teachers are dedicated to the students, not forgetting the warm and love tendered to the kids and myself especially appreciate the constant feedback shared between the parents and teachers so that we are always aware on the kids learning and behavior and together both parents and teachers will surveillance to tackle any issues. For the past 5 years the kids has made many wonderful friends, it‚Äôs such a sweet feeling as we literally watch these kids grow. Also, great friendship were forged with the teachers - a special shout out to Tr D, MuMu Laoshi for their dedication to the K2 class especially to Tr D. Not only on curriculum, she take times and effort to cultivate kids interest on other activities eg art and craft. My kids like pokemon, sometimes during free time she will draw with them. There was once my son brought back a pikachu drawing and it was drew by her. We did not know there is this artistic side of her! haha.  And personally on top of being a form teacher, I feel her warm yet strict calibre makes her an excellent discipline mistress too! The kids loves her to bits. Also kudos to MuMu Laoshi for holding the fort when there was a shortage on Chinese teachers, she tried her best to multi task and responded to our requests to her best ability. Ending off we would like to take this chance to say BIG thank you to all staff of LGH @ Tampines, Tr D, MuMu Laoshi, Tr Beth, Tr Jem, Ms Melissa and the past teachers like Tr Winnie, Tr Christina, Tr Fatin, Tr Salha, Tr May, Song Laoshi, Tr Suki, Zhang Laoshi, Miao Laoshi, Wang Laoshi, Auntie May.

Little Green House @ Yishun,"Little Green House @ Yishun has been an incredible place for our family, and we couldn't be more grateful for the exceptional care our child, Giselle Loh, has received. As we bid farewell to this wonderful child care center, we want to extend our heartfelt appreciation to two remarkable individuals who have made a lasting impact on our child's development and well-being: Teacher Yang and Teacher Siti, particularly in Giselle's Chinese class.  From the moment Giselle stepped into the doors of Little Green House @ Yishun at just one and a half years old, we knew we had made the right choice for her early childhood education. The warm and nurturing atmosphere at the center, coupled with the dedication and expertise of the staff, has made it a second home for our little one.  Teacher Yang's commitment to Giselle's Chinese language development has been truly exceptional. She possesses the rare gift of making learning both fun and educational, inspiring a genuine love for the language in our child. Under Teacher Yang's guidance, Giselle has blossomed into a confident and expressive little communicator. We are incredibly grateful for the patience and encouragement Teacher Yang has shown Giselle over the years, nurturing her love for the Chinese language.  Teacher Siti, on the other hand, has been a constant source of comfort and support for Giselle throughout her journey at Little Green House. Her caring and compassionate approach has ensured that Giselle always felt safe and cherished, allowing her to develop not only academically but also emotionally. Her kindness and dedication have provided Giselle with a solid foundation upon which to build her future learning experiences.  It is with heavy hearts that we say goodbye to Little Green House @ Yishun, but we do so with the knowledge that Giselle is well-prepared for her next educational adventure. The exceptional care provided by the center, and especially by Teacher Yong and Teacher Siti, has been instrumental in Giselle's growth and development during her time here.  We will always hold a special place in our hearts for Little Green House @ Yishun and these incredible teachers who have played such a vital role in Giselle's early years. Thank you for your dedication, love, and support, and for making Giselle's time here truly unforgettable. We will miss you all and wish the center continued success in nurturing and educating young minds., I am happy with the teachers' efforts towards the students' welfare. My little one joined last year. She's not looking forward to school on the first day as short experience somewhere else didn't give her much confidence. Teacher Semy brought her to mingle with older girls and allowed her to sit next to a classmate who's very keen to befriend her. The teachers play with her. Teacher Song and Teacher Siti are her friends.  My child has since found a home away from home at the Little Greenhouse - she has made many friends and enjoys the programmes. We can see her growth through the Smart Literacy programme and enrichment lessons offered here. We appreciate that Teacher Yang's dedication to teach Chinese and make the school a fun place to be.  I appreciate all the teaching staff and aunties supporting the school to make this a wonderful journey for my child. It is the best decision we have made to move my child to this school., I want to express my sincere gratitude to all the teachers who have contributed to my child's growth and curiosity for learning. Throughout the 4 years at Little Green House @ Yishun.  Thanks Yang Lao Shi and Teacher Siti, I'm so thankful for the wonderful experience and quality care Leryn is getting from you. Leryn always excited to go to school and raves about her amazing teachers and friends when she comes home. Thanks for putting my mind at ease while I'm away, and thank you for everything you do for her everyday., The school has taken great efforts in the language, social and emotional literacy of the children. I have seen great personal development of my son. He is able to express his emotions effective and articulate well in English conversation. He has started to speak Chinese words and shown interest in learning and writing the Chinese language which is an achievement for him and a key milestone for me as a parent.  This year especially the last 4 months, he is also more confident and comfortable with people around him, and have started to enjoy school.  Thanks and grateful to Principals and all Teachers @ Little Green House Yishun for their patience in guiding our children as well as listening to the feedback of the parents and constantly making the school experiences better and better for the children and at the same time keeping us parents updated on our children's progress in school.  Kudos!, My daughter has been enrolled in the school since March 2023 and she likes her teachers a lot, always telling me about them being kind to her.

But I think it might be common for most kindergartens located at the 1st floor of HDB., Thank you LGH@Yishun!, Thanks to the teachers at Little Green House Yishun 832 Kindergarten for their hard work, allowing my children to learn and grow happily in the kindergarten. Seeing my child go to kindergarten happily every day, I feel that my choice is the right one. Thank you to all the teachers at little green house @Yishunü•∞ ‚Ä¶"
Little Greenhouse @ Hougang Pte Ltd,"My son loves going to school and he is fond of his teachers. This is very comforting for a mother. The principal also updates me regularly about my child and share what the teachers have been engaging him with., Little Green House Hougang Childcare Centre is an exceptional haven for nurturing young minds. Special thanks to Principal Shirley, whose leadership sets the tone for a supportive and enriching atmosphere.  Teachers Alice, Lina, Mah, and Xu Laoshi go above and beyond, creating a warm, engaging environment that fosters both learning and play. The well-designed facilities, coupled with their innovative curriculum, provide a solid foundation for children's development.  My child thrives here, and I'm grateful for the dedication of Principal Shirley and the incredible teaching team. Little Green House is undoubtedly a top choice for parents seeking a reliable and enriching childcare experience. Highly recommended!, The school introduce activities both indoor or outdoor to enrich student general knowledge in different areas. It also introduce Singapore culture and diversity and inject it to school's curriculum., The Teachers, Aunties and Principle are very dedicated, caring and patient with my kid, who's probably the #1 crybaby üòÖ. My kid spontaneously breaks into fun songs from time to time, I guess he enjoys the lessons. Hope to see my kid continue to learn and grow with his friends and enemies (haha) at Little Greenhouse @Hougang ‚Ä¶, Very supportive principal and teachers in Little Green House. They know the learning needs of young children., Brought my first child here and now my second as well. Great service and excellent teaching skills, Our kids love going to school! The teachers are kind, communications are smooth and fast with the centre principal., Good programme, teachers and principle are nice and patience., Teachers and Aunties all very nice and caring., The principal and teachers are very friendly."
Little Greenhouse @ Woodlands Pte Ltd,"The location of the Centre is super near to the train station & is very convenient especially raining days. Have enrolled my boy to the childcare since Dec 2022. I must said all the teachers are friendly & most importantly patience to the kids. They will provide feedback & progress of my son regularly either through app or during fetching time. My son has been crying upon reaching the school door for the past months & he is not eating school food as well. Despite these, the teachers will try their best to greet him first, come out of the door to fetch him in & also at least to give him biscuits & packet milk which I have prepared. I can also see big improvement since enrollment time in terms of speaking & expressing what he wants or feel. A big thank you to all the teachers; highly recommend! üòä, The school is very conveniently located beside the MRT and there's shelter all the way. I've enrolled my boy since Jan and the principal and teachers have been the most patient and caring as my boy had very bad separation anxiety. They would provide updates/photos to me regularly which makes me feel assured that my son is in good hands. Teachers are very detailed and would show care and concern whenever my son is absent from school. And of course, they are good in instilling discipline, nurturing them into independent kids while equipping them with the necessary literacy skills! My boy's languages definitely improved alot after attending little green house playgroup!, Since Playgroup, my son, Mohamed Al-Fateh has been enrolled in the Little Green House School. I can still remember how he cried every day when he had to go to school because he didn't want to go and I'm having a hard time getting him settled into school. Despite this, the teachers at Little Green House School have been patient and putting in their best effort to help my son adjust to school. Now, he even chooses his favourite teachers in school, which are Teacher Siti and Teacher Merry.  The teachers are truly invested in my son's education and growth as a learner. I was worried when my son couldn't speak in words or sentences, but I'm surprised that he started to say a few words and even speak in sentences after coming back home from school. It is my belief that a great leader is necessary for the success of great teachers. Ms. Nanz has been extremely helpful in assisting me with the subsidiary application. Her face is always filled with happiness and she greets her parents with a big smile on her face. The school, teachers, principal, and environment hold a special place in my heart. ‚ù§Ô∏è, Conveniently located within 30 seconds walk from Marsiling Mrt. Loved the fact that they have monthly food menus serving curated meals for the children. Can see that Ms Nanz is a very dedicated principal, often see her in the classrooms hanging out with the kids. What is best is that the school is well ventilated. They do on the Aircon, but it is not switched on at a super low temperature, and the windows are opened, which means lesser mass spreading of cough and flu bugs., Enrolled my son to this preschool since he turned 18 months old. Very happy to share that we had pleasant experience with them as we had some really bad experience with his previous infant school. The teachers and principal are always willing to go the extra mile for the children. My child has bad eczema and need special attention to apply cream and the use of cot sheets during nap time. They did all of these and even check in regularly on his skin condition. Special mention to the principal Ms Nanz and his mandarin teacher, Wang laoshi. A school highly recommended!, I like the school. The Centre is very clean. I like the Principal, Principal is very good. Teachers took good care of my children and feedback on their behaviour and development., LGH Woodlands at blk 161 has been part of our family for more than 7 years. We couldn‚Äôt thank all of you enough for sharing and building the most part of our children‚Äôs learning foundations. From our nieces, our first child, to our ever active Rafa, LGH‚Äôs teachers never seem to run out of patience and commitment to take good care of our children.  The school's Literacy Programme is especially helpful for my child since he started at 18 months. I love how the teachers engage their students by story telling, singing, dancing, exposing them outdoors, and hands-on art activities. They teach them how to work and play independently, as well as how to socialise and interact with their peers.  We would like to thank specially Tr Fikah, Wang Laoshi, Tr Merry, Tr Jessie, Xiao Laoshi, Tr Siti, Zhang Laoshi, Ms Nanz, and the other teachers who are also not around anymore: tr Ng, tr Ping, tr Kas, and ms Dawn. Your job and calling is not easy, and we are very grateful for going out of your way, for the concern, and for doing the best you can. We appreciate you from the bottom of our hearts. Thank you once again, all the best and stay safe!, I enrolled two of my girls there. The teachers are very empathetic, loving and kind towards my children. My girls enjoy attending school and gave positive feedback about their teachers, friends, and learning experiences. The teachers would provide me with an update on their well-being, interactions with others and learning when necessary., My kids love going to school.The Teacher is also good,very friendly and conscientious . Teacher will share with the parents what the child is doing in school., Great place for the kids., Very good childcare centre and strategic location right at Marsiling MRT.. My son loves the teacher and friends during his 1 year period in LGH Woodlands, unfortunately I had to move to Jurong and luckily my new place had another LGH branch. Principal Miss Nanz was very helpful through out my transfer process...thumbs up!!"
Little Mighty Me Pte Ltd,"My child enjoys his time in IFC and gets exposures through the varying activities they offer to engage the little ones despite a smaller environment. The teachers are attentive to their needs and would often share feedback about the child during check ins and outs, adhering to the principle of collaboration as important aspect of child‚Äôs growth and development. As a first time parent, LMM has given me a good impression and confidence that they care for the infants well being and development holistically!, Little Mighty Me is a cozy school with very sweet and caring teachers. My son attended the school from 18 months and he absolutely loved to go to school and he adored his teachers. He managed to build wonderful friendships among his friends over the years and the school has a great learning environment for the little ones. Although we have relocated and moved our little one out from school, my son still misses his dear friends and teachers very much. Thank you teachers, especially a big thank you to Ms Adeline for taking care of my son from day 1!, LMM has the best infant care teachers! They are so caring and thoughtful, and my daughter loves being in the company of her favourite teachers! üòä ‚Ä¶, a private childcare centre located on the 2nd level with a small playground and a small fitness corner and a pavilion right outside.  class size is about 12 to 15 kids ratio to 1 english teacher and 1 chinese teacher. school organised periodic outings for the kids but due to current covid-19 situation, temporary suspend all class outings except letting the children to explore the nearby surrounding area.  teachers are all very professional and dedicated and most importantly caring towards the children which was the main reason for my son to enrol in the first place.  currently checking in and taking temperature of all children is right outside of the school entrance before they are allow in. whole school is disinfect regularly.  teachers will also send food menus of what the kids will be having the whole week in advance to the parents. nice gesture i feel.  there is an app to check daily photos of your child arriving and departure, some news from the school or MOE which is very convenient for us parents. overall a highly recommended centre if you are staying nearby., The school contacted me after 6 months because I gave them a 2 star review. 6 months later, after we have left, and now they are concerned about our review. If they took the initiative to hear what our concerns were initially, we could have stayed in the school. Anyways, this is an edited version but most of the context remains the same. I believe we are not the only parents who have encountered this based on other reviews. (The Teachers in the infant-care are a good dedicated bunch, I would not say the same about the covering Teachers as sometimes when I collect my child, they have a strong sweat stench, which I noticed came from the covering teachers, which is unhygienic. Facility wise and general updating is good. School increased the cost until it became ridiculously expensive. The management of the school seems to not be able to empathise certain issues, just a standard reply every time you question things regarding the school. No mediation of the problem. I took my child out after 5 months there and found a better school which charge half the price. Another issue is they kept on closing and sending kids back for the smallest issue. During covid, they would close so frequent because they had to clean the place up. All of these, and still charging full cost of school fees.), Wonderful school. The school is just a stone's throw away from the Punggol station. Great learning environment and very welcoming atmosphere.   Our daughter has learned so much since being enrolled here. She absolutely loves the school and has a wonderful relationship with her friends and caring teachers.  We were very pleased with the school. To the teachers and staff, we can't thank you enough for your extra care and wonderful teachings to our daughter. We appreciate all you do. Thank you., It was bad after the childcare change the principal in the year 2020 June. Teachers internally have political issue, and teachers are changing. The team wasn‚Äôt kind to kids. Not recommended, Good ratio of teacher to infant. Good exposure to chinese language."
Little Olive Tree (FMC Farrer Park),"Kindergarten is really good and renounced school, Before joining kindergarten, my daughter was unable to express her views in clear terms as she joined kindergarten, she started expressing her views in clear terms with good gestures.  Apart from these, they give heed attention to studies and extracurricular activities. After joining kindergarten, my daughter is doing well in every kind of field.  Thanks, teachers and all staff of the kindergarten to put strenous effort with my daughter and to make my daughter confident üëçüëå‚ò∫Ô∏èüëè, I love the preschool, they are a hidden gem In the area. The way the teachers are associated with the children, its really amazing. They understand the children and work so closely with them giving attention to each one of them. The activities are also very interestingly conducted. Am very happy to have chosen this preschool for my daughter!  Highly recommended!, A hidden gem preschool. My 2 sons attended there and went on to flourish in their schools. I believe it is the curiosity and confidence to discover answers for themselves that the kindie pedagogy had instilled in them. They have fond memories there and would visit at least annually, even though my elder son had graduated many years ago and is in secondary school now., The creativity and dedication of the teachers to ensuring the children have a varied and enriching education that goes beyond the four walls of the school is really heartrending.  We always look forward to the various occasions and events commemorated, such as Chinese New Year, Easter and even Total Defence Day. The teachers never fail to organise the most fun and engaging themed activities for the children. During Total Defence Day, they put together an unbelievable obstacle course with face painting for the kids right in the school. During CNY, the kids learnt to play traditional Chinese drums.  This term, the K2 kids are learning about nature and we have embarked on several projects in the outdoors together. The school also engaged someone from the Science Centre to bring in live creatures such as a lizard and cushion star for the kids to experience. Their immense effort to make learning fun is truly commendable.  The principal Mdm Ten is a friendly, firm and trustworthy professional who has a big heart for the kids and high standards. The school's WhatsApp channel is also responsive and communicative. They've sent me updates even in the evening! Truly outstanding comms.  All in all, my son really enjoys school, and it's all kudos to the wonderful staff at Foochow. Thank you so much for everything you do in making a difference in young lives., Foochow Preschool is a great school. My daughter has enjoyed her time there since Nursery one. The teachers are kind and caring. Their 6hr program is also very good., Kindergarten is really good , all teachers are so caring and loving specially teacher Shun and teacher Amy.Principal Mdm Ten is really helping.Their staff is really good I really liked the kind of atmosphere and environment they provide the children. My daughter was really happy there., I am so proud of my daughter, At Fuling Methodist Preschool Education Center, colleagues care about and help each other. The principal also actively helps teachers to continuously improve their professional skills. A good working environment can make every teacher feel cared for and supported, and colleagues can help and care for each other. Colleagues will share their knowledge and experience at work. If a colleague encounters difficulties, other colleagues will provide help and support to overcome the difficulties together. Colleagues will also listen to and understand each other, and provide support and care in work and life. Here, the principal will continuously provide professional training to teachers to help them learn new teaching methods and skills and improve their teaching level. The principal will also communicate with teachers regularly, provide feedback and guidance on teaching, help teachers find problems and make improvements in a timely manner; provide teachers with necessary teaching resources and support to help teachers carry out teaching work better. This is a school full of family warmth."
Little Olive Tree (Pasir Ris 21),Friendly and helpful teachers who pays attention to details. My children enjoy the school life here.
Little Olive Tree (Pasir Ris 51),
Little Olive Tree (Tampines),"PCS teachers are full of love and passion in caring for our young ones. I would say the teachers are the most dedicated, among my experience with various preschools, including learningkidz, mindchamps, and a few other private ones. staff dedication:    5 out of 5 professional competency: 5 out of 5 cost: 6 out of 5 (service exceeds what is expected from the school fee) This is the best preschool in Singapore., Awesome educators and management team. Always go beyond the extra mile in educating and caring for the kids! Special gratitude and thanks especially to my child K2 teachers, specialist and principal Jen!"
Little Paddington Preschool Serangoon Pte Ltd,"It‚Äôs a worst preschool! Bad experience! Do not put your little one there!  1. Most of teachers don‚Äôt have love on the little ones, they don‚Äôt consider with their hearts how to enlighten different children; they don‚Äôt think of ways how to let the new enrolled children to adapt well;  2. As a preschool teacher, they don‚Äôt have any patience. I know some teachers there always rebuke and grumble when children vomited, wet floor, wet clothe, didn‚Äôt take a nap‚Ä¶  3. They spend their time on taking photos of children and writing beautiful reports to show parents, they don‚Äôt think as a preschool teacher, caring and loving are the most important things.  My child felt unhappy, upset and didn‚Äôt want to go this preschool everyday. After changing, now she loves her current preschool. One of my neighbor has the same feelings like me. Now my other neighbors don‚Äôt choose Little Paddington any more., Worst experiences in this preschool. 1. Poor school management, same issues keep happening. 2. Teachers treat the little kids as middle school students, teaching is their task but care and love is not. When kids cried, their typical way of handling kid is to let kids calm down by themselves. 3. When kids playing outside, teachers are focusing on taking pictures without being cautious to look after the kids. 4. Vibes in the school is anxious and nervous. Don't know why, teachers look unhappy every day., FANTASTIC SCHOOL!  My grandchild went here. From infant onwards all the way to k2 class. A big thanks to all the teachers who have made the journey so enjoyable for her. Teacher Esther, Ms Rev, Ms cherry and all her laoshis. The school was a home for her., Teachers are amazing and caring. My son is a fussy eater, but teachers have been really patient and encouraging. A wonderful place that I can leave my son with a peace of mind each morning. Shoutout to his favourite teacher, Teacher Glenn., An awesome school. Its been 3 years, all the teachers are very warm and friendly. They all seem to know my children and are very caring. A special mention to the PG teachers who really helped Aaravs transition into the school, My kid used to be in little paddington Serangoon. So here are the things that i think I need to highlight: First of all, I recommended this school to one of my friend and she made an appointment with the Principal to visit the school. But the day when she was supposed to visit the school the principal was not there!? And she did not even inform her earlier that she would not be available on that day! Second, This school keeps increasing fees from $850-$1300/per month. But my kid learnt nothing from this school. My kid cant even identify alphabet and numbers. Third, There were 2 fillipino teachers i was quite shocked when i saw the way they spoke English(singlish: lah leh ) and the way they talked to parents(they kept calling children‚Äôs mothers, ‚ÄùMummy, Mummy‚Äù instead of calling them by their names) it made me feel like they are not as professional as I expected. Overall, I‚Äôm not going to recommend this school to any of my friends anymore., Comparing different pre schools Little Paddington is a good pre-school for locals from my experience. The downside it is quite big with infant care to K2 classes. l would not recommend it for kids with an international esp western background (I.e. assessment reports in Mandarin only)., I have chosen this school for my daughter because it is an established brand name and the school is managed and run by well-educated and experienced owner and staff. The facilities for the children are excellent., Large playground at kovan branch, pricey but still take many kids, teachers mostly helpful but administrative staff/ matters can be a mess eg 2 months to get CDA before that pay cash"
Little Paddington Preschool Tanglin Park Pte Ltd,"LP team is very patient, professional and caring. School set up includes both outdoors fun, indoors creativity, that are crucial to me for a kid‚Äôs childhood school. My gal looks forward to school daily mostly ‚ò∫Ô∏è Just one trivial perhaps, to do more fogging to reduce mozzies around that vicinity. Mozzies get attracted to my gal readily easily.., My children are enjoying the pre-school very much. Good facilities and understanding teachers. Lots of open space and outdoor spaces for children to play and run about. The learning is also very structured and focused on children‚Äôs abilities. The principal Ms Shashi is awesome. Keep up the great work., Amazing pre-school. Had a fantastic run at Little Paddington with both of my daughters. It truly is an 'Outstanding School': the staff are fantastic. Everyone is so approachable and understanding, and nothing is too much for them."
Little Petals @ Symphony,"My granddaughter transferred out of Little Petals from 1 Feb to M.Y WORLD at Canberra Eastlink because we moved house & M.Y WORLD is nearer. Unfortunately M.Y WORLD childcare service & attitude of the playgroup teachers including Principal were atrociously unacceptable & extremely bad - to the extent that we are now pending investigations from ECDA & if need be, submit to the police.  Thanks to Little Petals that my granddaughter was able to return to the Centre for playgroup. Knowing my granddaughter‚Äôs traumatic experience at M.Y WORLD, Mr Yap of Little Petals made efforts to assign the previous infant care teacher who took care of my granddaughter to help with transition from infant care to playgroup.  Our little one cried hysterically whenever she reached M.Y WORLD but today, she returned to Little Petals as a happy girl. What a great relief to all of us, despite the commute is further & the inconvenience brought by rain.  Little Petals is a private premium childcare service & this comes with a price tag but knowing the entire Centre is dedicated to delivering their mission & passion to caring for our little ones, it is all worthwhile to pay a premium.  Kudos to Mr & Mrs Yap and all the teachers! I am thankful!"
Little Petals Preschool Pte Ltd,"Mr Yap the owner of the school gives a very personalised touch to Little Petals, teachers are very loving and know each child well. My child has attended Little Petals from 18 months to K2, and he enjoys school very much! I like to close communication Little Petals has with parents, thank you for giving my child a good environment the past few years!, My neighbour had been very angry that her child had been falling sick so frequently in this preschool at Symphony. It is so frequent that they are all extremely unhappy and tired. Heard that there are also frequent HFMD and covid cases. Plenty of germs and bacteria in this school. Place appears dirty looking too. I have a baby at home, and I am now so scared whether my neighbour and her child would spread the dirty school germs and bacteria to me. A preschool not recommended., Great Infant care facility at Symphony Suites !! Its a lovely place. It is sparkling clean and tidy at all times of the day. The teachers are engaging, lively and energetic. A special thanks to Mr & Mrs Yap for taking care of our baby so well., Little Petals Preschool is a premium child care centre located in Yishun, aimed at providing a nurturing, fun, safe, clean and enriching environment where children blossom and have a memorable childhood."
Little Seeds Preschool (Capstone),"It has been about 3.5 years since we started journeying with the teachers at Little Seeds Preschool (LSP) Capstone on the care and growth for 2 of our children (7 and 5 years old). The older child has graduated to Primary school but still has many fond memories of his time back at Little Seeds. His time at LSP Capstone provided a good foundation and smooth transition to Primary School.  Currently, our younger child looks forward to school everyday! She loves Praise and Worship, pastoral time, outdoors and music lessons. She also enjoyed the Project Work process where the teachers and children embarked on many STEAM activities to learn about the topic of Water and went on an excursion to the NEWater Visitor Centre!  I really appreciate that my children are in good hands each day with teachers who love and care for them deeply and they effectively communicate through regular updates. From my conversations with my children, I understand that teaching does not happen only through a one-way instruction but through play and facilitated discussions to help the children question and discover truths for themselves. In terms of curriculum, I love the Key to Learning Syllabus and the way phonics is systematically taught.  More importantly, values like gratitude, self-control, appreciation are taught and modeled in school. I see how my children are thriving in LSP Capstone and would definitely recommend this place!"
Little Seeds Preschool (Kiddy Ark),
Little Seeds Preschool (Praiseland),"I came across this preschool while searching for a school for my 18-month-old child, and I'm so glad I did. Our priority was a Christian-based preschool as we are Christian ourselves, and this school fit the bill perfectly. From registering to enrolling, everything has been a breeze. The principal and admin staff have been incredibly proactive in replying to parents' inquiries.  I enrolled my two kids into this school this year, and the transition for my PG Tod and N1 Tod has been incredibly smooth. They love going to school every day and not once have they complained about not wanting to go.  I've personally witnessed the love from the teachers, principal, and even the cooks there. I couldn't thank the school enough for giving so much care and attention to the students and providing them with healthy meals. My N1 Tod is a picky eater, but she never fails to finish her meal and often asks for more.  If you're looking for a loving, Christian-based preschool where your child will thrive, I highly recommend this school. Thank you to the entire staff for all that you do!, I have sent my both children to the care enter for the past 5 years. The Teachers are very enthusiastic in teaching, show the care and love to children. My both children really like the teachers here and enjoy the learning and activities in the school. It‚Äôs definitely a wonderful journey for my 2 children. Thanks to all the teachers and supporting staff., Both my children now 9 and 6 have been attending school in little seeds preschool (Praiseland) from 18 months. Truly a pleasant journey for both the kids and as parents ourselves.  Our children have learnt so much and grown so much. This school nurtures the children with a holistic approach.  Both parents are able to go to work at ease because we know the children are well taken care of.  Highly recommend this centre for all other parents who are looking for preschool in Yishun area.  Lastly thank you to management, admins, teachers and aunties for the dedication. My children wouldn‚Äôt have a more pleasant transition to embark in the next journey of their lives.  Thank you very very much., I like that bible stories and worship songs are taught to the kids. The teachers are also understanding, patient, and encouraging towards my daughter who is on the shy side and takes a long time to warm up. The principal is also very approachable and there is open communication which helps to build trust between the parent and the school, My 3 children all go to this awesome childcare. Teachers and principal are well trained and most of all loving. They love the children regardless of race or religion with so much love. All my kids learned how to be independent learners and self reliant. My 3 year old can shower herself. Well done praised, Teachers and Anna., What more can I say? One of the best in Yishun. All my 4 children attends this preschool. Honestly, It‚Äôs a great place! I am not affiliated to them in any way, just giving my honest review., A school with great staff who cares and love our children. It‚Äôs a small school with good attention given to the young learners., A great childcare centre with patient and kind teachers. Please continue with the good works., Loving teacher Clean environment"
Little Seeds Preschool (Sonshine),"My kids love the teachers there. As a parent, I can feel the teachers are truly caring and passionate in teaching.  The teachers and principal takes each feedback very seriously. We felt safe sending the kids there., My boy has been attending Sonshine since March this year and I'm thankful for the care and concern the teachers have extended to my little boy while he's here. A special shoutout to Teacher Ting, Siyu laoshi, Mrs Gomez, Jessica and the cooking aunties for being so doting on my cheeky boy. This is a truly a school I can trust. Environment is clean and airy. Communication is prompt and transparent. Activities are less academic driven but more lifeskills, nature, social and moral value driven, which I really appreciate., My girl said that she loves her school because the teachers are so good and the lessons are very fun! She enjoys playing with her friends and going for excursions! We are grateful to the teachers and staffs who took great care of her. Thank you! üòä ‚Ä¶, Teachers are good, they care about kids and teach them in good ways, appreciated, I feel safe to leave my son to them"
Little Seeds Preschool (TSA - Ang Mo Kio),"Both my sons are in this branch and overall experience enjoyable and fun. They have learnt valuable and useful knowledge and skills. At the same time, soft skills like communication and socialising, self-discipline and mutual-respect were cultivated. The Teachers are very approachable and professional. Thank you Little Seeds:) 2022 additions to last year‚Äôs reviews: the centre adopted project-based learnings, for example, my boy in K1 spent a few weeks learning different kinds of ants as well as related knowledge. Both the EL & CL teachers worked together and planned meaning activities relating to this project, such as, story-telling, interview & interactions with Uncle John(the owner of an Ant Keeping shop, not sure if I remember the name correctly), outdoor explorations, drawing and colouring etc. kids really enjoyed and learnt a lot of knowledge. At the same time, their interests in the nature and insects were also developed.  My younger boy in N2 has grown to be more independent in doing things like changing clothes, brushing teeth, eating meals etc, thanks to the continuous guidance and encouragements from both teacher Susi & teacher YL. Important life skills and interpersonal communication skills were taught and cultivated and I think these are essential in nurturing young kids. Special thanks to teacher Susi who taught both my sons phonics and I really appreciate your efforts in building strong foundations in kids at young age., The teachers here are exceptionally caring and proactive in ensuring the best for my child.  They were patient to educate life skills that will be useful for kids such as teaching them conflict management skills and making friends with everyone. The teachers are also patient in managing different kind of students and helping the students to learn to be inclusive and adaptable.  In the last 2 years with little seeds (Ang Mo Kio) have been a life saver for me as I entrust my 3rd child and return back to the workforce. The teachers I've connected with have been wonderful to ensure my youngest son (now K2 starlight) is well equipped and ready for primary school- from teacher Jiexin to Teacher Lifang, Teacher Susie, Teacher Yiling, as well as the chef aunty florence and other staff have been so kind. The principals that I've been in contact with such as Teacher lian choon and teacher Dawn have always been kind and respectful too.  I know there have been a few set backs or accidents the school had but the school have managed them excellently well and stood up to the storm and remained professional - dealing with the issue at hand and not persons involved. I do think that accidents are unavoidable because we are dealing with children who are constantly changing and growing.  And it is not easy to be a teacher in this present day especially a childcare teacher, needing to manage kids of different needs and parents with different expectations, yet needing to balance their own lives as daughters to their own moms or moms to their own kids at home.  Thank you for always giving your best, always empathetic and ready to help so that parents like me can go back to work with a peace of mind.  I truly thank God for your school!, I sent my two children to Little Seeds Preschool soon after both turned 20 months old. I was skeptical in the beginning because I was reading and hearing many bad incidents happened in preschools all around Singapore. After few months in the school, I am so glad that I‚Äôve made the right choice. My kids are now in N1 and K1, I am assessing the school and my children in multiple areas. In term of the school, Teachers are very caring, loving, patience, communicating well with parents and showing empathy to the children. There were few minor incidents happened to my kids and they called me immediately to informed and clarified the issues with me. Principle and Admin Executives are very responsive and react fast to parent‚Äôs requests/enquiries. Thumbs up to the lovely Aunties who are preparing foods for the children, they are so in love with the children until my kids demanded me to buy presents to them in all occasions. Can you imagine what environment that the children are living in? On the other hands, some of the things need to be improved like the hygiene of the floor and environmental care like mosquitoes/insect‚Äôs issue bite. Both of my kids used to have mosquito‚Äôs bites but soon after I addressed the issue, the school responded fast and able to provide better environment for the children. Well done!  In term of the school curriculum, the school adopted learn through play, outdoor learning and exploration, key to learning, project-based learning, visual arts, current affairs, art & craft, story time and many more. These make it so fun for the children and two of my kids love going to school. My kids are not just learning how to read and write in the school like most preschools are emphasizing. I don‚Äôt have to send them to enrichment classes and hence I spend more time with them on weekend. Due to Covid-19, outdoor activities are being suspended and kids are feeling sad. Besides that, I love the idea of celebration of events like CNY, Hari Raya, Deepavali, National Day, Teachers Day, Children Day, Harmony Day, Mid- Autumn festival and school projects like our dreams for Singapore. Fantastic!  In term of my children, they both are doing well so far. We are the parents of emphasizing in characters building at these ages. They both have good EQ and showing good moral values like loving, respecting the senior, kind, showing empathy, communicating well with people, have good cognitive abilities. But my older one need more affords in anger management. Both showing good social responsibilities like they will complain to me that people shouldn‚Äôt throw rubbish on the floor and must keep our Singapore clean! Or cannot speak too loud in public places and many fun things happen every day. They both love going to school and my older boy can read well and write in English. My younger one loves sharing fun things in the school and kept mentioning Aunties CP and Aunties TY teach me this and that. Having says that, School needs more work to speed up their Chinese lesson or teaching parents how create interest in learning Chinese. However, my son can speak in Chinese after 3 years in the school and we don‚Äôt speak Chinese at home. Thanks to Little Seeds and I really grateful that the school can provide such a wonderful learning journey to my kids., A very reliable and homely childcare, with caring and patient Teachers. I am rest-assured that my child is in very good hands when I am working. My boy also love to go to school everyday., My kids has been there since 2016. My youngest is only in N1. Would recommend the place if you are looking for a place where kids are growing holistically and with good self esteem. My kids love the teachers., My child is in this centre and I really appreciate the teachers and the principal there. They are kind and patient with him and put my mind at ease since he is there for the whole day."

Little Shepherds√Ç¬í Schoolhouse @ Church of the Holy Trinity,"Well. The church does serve lots of ppl from all walks and from around the world.  But sadly each time, I stood by the Traffic junction to cross, I felt sad n shame, that we are so impatient to cross, ppl are already crossing half way while the ""Lights"" are still RED. Am I to say we Catholics are so impatient n inconsiderate,  not forgetting we have just praised GOD n now we behave in such an irrational way, showing our negative attitudes to the rest of ppl around Us. I sometine  felt like shouting to all who are rushing to cross, but i relented n stood there praying for them. I pray the next time,  there will be a group Saints crossing the Holy Trinity Traffic Junction. Amen, Nice church to go to. The actual mass and church is on the 3rd floor of the building for new comers. It can be a little confusing., A peaceful and spirit-filled Church that everyone will be enticed to attend the mass everyday esp. Sunday services., I studied there for2 yrs n1 and n2 in 2006 & 2007, Attended friend's wedding soleminsation, Good atmosphere, Describe"
Little Shepherds√Ç¬í Schoolhouse@Church of St Francis of Assisi-JW,"Withdraw my child from this school. Not even two weeks there and got injured twice. I am still angry over what have happened, so bad that i have to bring my child to a&e. Almost admitted for further investigation under sedation. Teacher informed parent via app message and is not accurate to the actual incident happened to my child. I find this as a big red flag. After i enrol my child in this school, i observed my child and i noticed my child became more timid, even to motorbike sound. I should have withdraw from this school in the first week itself!"

Luther Preschool,"Personally, the litmus test on whether young kids should attend a school is whether they love or hate attending school.  I have a 3 year old who started at this school since Nov 2021, and recently a 18 month old who started in Jun 2023. So far they have very happy demeanor every morning when I send them to school. The interaction between my kids and the teachers & non-teaching staff at school is also very positive.  Earlier when I assessed the school environment, I like that because it is contained within Queenstown Lutheran Church, there is normally less strangers passing by on weekdays. Each class also has its own physical classroom - which was important for me esp it was during COVID times when I registered my 1st child. There's a small garden, swing, playground, scooter and tricycles all within the church premises that the kids can use. They also take the opportunity to teach the kids about nature and care for the plants in the garden.  Course content also has a lot of creative learning. Every term the kids have 1 field trip to learn about the real world outside school. For all key festivals and holidays the kids are educated about the significance of the event and encouraged to create an art n craft piece to take home.  The real bonus for us is that my elder kid has finally learnt to eat vegetables through the daily encouragement at school. Also independently brings the used utensils to the kitchen sink, then wipes away the food debris.  Teachers are very attentive to the kids, and you can see they work together to educate and watch out for the little ones. Keep up the good work dear Luther Preschool!, My 3 kids attended Luther Preschool, the teachers are loving and caring, it is a really nice environment with lots of space (indoor and outdoor) and my kids were well prepared for Primary 1., Very bad experience in this preschool. Teachers not caring and friendly. Not recommend."

M.Y World @ Canberra Eastlink,"I am writing to lodge an official complaint against M.Y WORLD @ Canberra Eastlink for negligence and unacceptable behaviour from the Playgroup teachers as well as Principal.  My granddaughter was enrolled into the Centre for PlayGroup on 1 February 2024 & she is on a 2-week trial period. As she was transferred from a former childcare centre where she had spent more than 13 months, we understood there is a period of adjusting & transition. Unfortunately we feel that the teachers‚Äô support for transition at M.Y WORLD was far below parental expectations, to a certain extent, lack of empathy.  During week of 5 Feb, which happened to be the 1st week after orientation, we encountered a few unsatisfactory incidents.  (1) the Centre called to say that my grandchild was crying uncontrollably & she was disturbing the rest of children during nap time, the Centre requires the caregiver or parent to bring the child home. My question : should the teacher(s) not try to pacify the crying child while she is still adjusting to the transition? What happens if the toddlers of the entire Playgroup class cried - does it mean the Playgroup has to stop operations & send all the crying toddlers home?  (2) on 6 Feb, when my grandchild returned from school, our helper noticed bad rashes from the child‚Äôs belly to pubic area. We tried to contact the teachers to enquire however generic responses were provided, trying to shy away from responsibility. There was no evident efforts to investigate into what happened at all.  (3) on 8 Feb, we received a notice from the centre that there was a bruise on the child‚Äôs face. There was no bruises on the evening of 7 Feb till the time when our helper sent the child to the Centre on 8 Feb morning. From the photo provided, it was suspected that the child could have hit a fixture.  (4) in one of the telecommunications with the Principal - Ms Puva, she shouted over the telephone to my daughter (parent of my granddaughter) - ""your husband wants to write in to ecda? SURE! by all means go ahead! if your child is not suitable for this centre you can always feel free to source elsewhere"". She also informed email responses take 3 working days (despite there are 2 admin staff and 2 Vice Principals) because she is not at her desk every minute.  M.Y WORLD at Canberra Eastlink was referred to us with positive feedback; unfortunately the reality turned out to be a horrifying experience for our family and my granddaughter. She used to be a happy kid going to school but she became an unhappy child when she arrived at the gate of the centre.  I am extremely disappointed with the experience & service quality of the teachers, including the Principal. I have no confidence that M.Y WORLD could deliver its mission in the childcare & education industry. The negligence is unacceptable and intolerable.  It was a nightmare enrolling my granddaughter into M.Y WORLD.  We have since withdrawn my granddaughter from the centre, as advised by the Principal during her tele-conversation with my daughter, to prevent any further hurt and victimization."

M.Y World @ Marsiling Greenview,"Glad to see a preschool within the new housing development of Marsiling Greenview and the future expansion to house more facility and to accommodate more students.  The existing location, while small has started serving the community and it is heartwarming to see children with their teachers walking around the development and playing at the multiple playgrounds within the development.  It created a truly multi-generational environment when you see the elderly exercising at the senior-friendly workout stations next to a playground filled within children."
M.Y World @ Punggol Edge,"All the teachers are very nice, patient, and I can see their enthusiasm in nurturing the children!

M.Y World @ Woodlands Circle,"I am writing to express my deep concern and dissatisfaction with the K2 education system and curriculum at M.Y World@Woodlands Circle Blk 725, particularly regarding the lack of preparation for students transitioning to Primary 1.  The preschool's K2 curriculum has proven to be inadequate in preparing students for the educational challenges they face upon entering Primary 1. There are several issues that need to be addressed:  1. Lack of Writing Materials: The preschool lacks sufficient writing materials, which hinders the development of essential writing skills in K2 students. This deficiency in resources severely impacts the students' ability to transition smoothly to Primary 1, where writing plays a crucial role in various subjects.  2. Inadequately Trained Teachers: It is evident that the teachers at M.Y World@Woodlands Circle Blk 725 are not adequately trained to effectively teach and prepare students for Primary School education. This lack of preparation has a direct impact on the students' readiness for the academic challenges they will face in Primary 1.  3. Curriculum Misalignment with Primary 1 Standards: The K2 curriculum at the preschool does not meet the necessary standards to facilitate a smooth transition for students entering Primary 1. The curriculum fails to adequately equip students with the foundational knowledge and skills required for success in Primary 1, including literacy, numeracy, and language skills.  As a result of these deficiencies, students transitioning to Primary 1 from M.Y World@Woodlands Circle Blk 725 encounter significant difficulty in coping with the new curriculum, particularly in areas such as spelling, early-stage mathematics, and English language. Many students are forced to backtrack and relearn basic concepts that should have been effectively covered during their time in preschool.  The overall quality of education and curriculum at the preschool is deeply disappointing, and it is clear that urgent improvements are needed to better prepare students for the challenges they will face in Primary 1 and beyond., One of the best preschool in Woodlands! Teachers are very well mannered and caring, mostly passionate! Principal invest a lot on new learning toys for kids development!  My child feared by previous preschool felt so happy and made many friends in the school. So happy after joining. Excellent jobs by Teachers! My nieces who graduated (3yrs) from MY World 725 is still praising the school so much! Myself loves the kind & engaging Teachers too. Highly recommended. Their curriculum are also very good like private school. Kids do learn well manners and good skills in the school. Mostly healthy and happy üòÉ, This centre doesn‚Äôt prepare K2 kids for transition to primary 1 due to their education syllabus don‚Äôt use worksheets to train the kids to prepare for primary 1. My son graduated from this preschool and now he is struggling transiting to primary 1 due to big different on education syllabus with this preschool and primary 1. This centre education system doesn‚Äôt even emphasize on kids writting skills and my son is struggling in primary 1. Highly not recommended this preschool centre despite we feedback numerous times to the centre teachers & principal on their education syllabus not preparing kids to next phase in primary 1 will make kids stress when they enter primary 1 stage."

Macpherson Sheng Hong Childcare Centre,"Macpherson Sheng Hong Childcare Centre is truly exceptional. Their commitment to early childhood development is evident in every aspect. The caring staff, stimulating environment, and innovative programs create a nurturing space where children thrive. A beacon of excellence in childcare!, When we first visited the school, we liked Shenghong Childcare Centre because it had lots of outdoor space. The double-story building has a high ceiling in the middle, making the activity space and canteen very airy. There are many educational and entertainment facilities for learning through playing such as sand play, slides, tricycles, vegetable gardens, and green grass fields for children to run. The school is also surrounded by greenary like flowers, fruit trees, and various eatible plants. Children learn about the vegetables and what they eat them. The teachers are very patient, calm and positive. They teach the children with love. They also spent time preparing a variety of interesting and creative teaching materials for children to have fun and educate during the experiment. The school had organised a variety of activities during festivals and inviting parents to celebrate and participate in interesting parent-child activities and games.  Their staff is also very friendly and approachable. It is wonderful that our children can learn and grow in such a loving environment., It's a lovely and safe place for the kids and they really enjoy their time in school. The teachers and staff very friendly and caring, also take very good care of the kids.The kids have a lot of fun and learning opportunities., I've witnessed an incredible transformation in my son during his time at Macperson Sheng Hong childcare centre.

I'm amazed by how he's become more expressive, a testament to the school's commitment to fostering holistic development. The support and encouragement provided by the teachers have truly made a difference in his learning journey.

MapleBear Gracefields Pte Ltd (One Tree Hill),"Five star for this lovely Maplebear school. We stay at Valley Park condo hence there were other preschools within a stone's throw, however we chose Maplebear Gracefields because: 1) outdoor playground (so children could play in the open space safely), and 2) bilingual curriculum. The bonus parts were: loving and kind teachers, fun school holiday program, and diverse student base. We highly recommend Maplebear Gracefields if you're looking for a great pre-school for your children., hello!!! I use to go to grace fields I miss going to  school there it was very fun!!!

MapleBear Jurong,"Love the school a lot as the teachers and staff were all very loving towards the kids and knew the kids‚Äô personalities inside out. This highly reflected their passion and dedication in this line of work and I feel assured leaving my kids in their good hands. The teachers and staff all felt like extended family and my kids enjoyed school thoroughly. Will recommend!, Idyllic and serene yet ultra convenient location. Love the spacious and open concept. Parents waiting area is huge and well thought-out.

MapleBear Jurong Lakeside,"As first time parents, my husband and I are super thankful for the professional and dedicated teachers at Maplebear Lakeside. Not only are they very understanding and accommodating to our baby‚Äôs needs, they genuinely care for the wellbeing of our baby by ensuring she feed well, sleep well and have fun at school.  We get prompt and constant updates from the teachers about our baby eg what activity she did in school, her progress, if she is eating well etc. With that, we are able to work with a peace of mind knowing our baby is in good hands. Also, teachers make sure she (even for a 3 months old infant) had a fun learning experience by engaging her in different activities every day.  Lastly, a shoutout to the kind and patience principle and teachers who made the effort to understand and address our concerns, and guided us throughout the whole enrolment process, orientation and all sorts of a school related matters.  Enrolling our baby with Maplebear lakeside is  one of the best decision we have made! And we know our baby agree too !"
MapleBear Labrador,"I send my 2-year-old son here for a playgroup and he is always in a playful and lively mood when I pick him up after work. The almost real-life feeds of this day on the Maple Bear mobile app let me know what he is eating for snack and lunch, when his diapers are changed, how long his naps are, and when he is dropped off & picked up. Principal and teachers communicate regularly and in details of how my son‚Äôs day went."

MindChamps Chinese PreSchool @ Tampines Central,"Since starting at MindChamp CPS in 2023, my daughter's daily excitement for school speaks volumes about the nurturing environment and the dedication of teachers like Zheng Laoshi and Teacher Melanie. Their efforts have fostered a friendly and inclusive classroom, making drop-offs a breeze and significantly enhancing her interest in learning, especially in Chinese, where she's made monumental progress. Highly recommend!, I am so glad that I placed my kid into this center. I feel assured that he is safe and will be well taken care of when he is in school. I can literally feel the stress off my mind when I drop him off everyday.  Joyce, the director and Mee Lin, the principal, are both exceptional in their duties. The fact that they make the effort to remember the names of all the children and their respective classes goes to show that they care and take their role seriously. The staff from reception to cleaning, are dedicated individuals who enjoy their work. In this time and age, it is hard to come by professionals who work hard, with heart.  Children there are happy and enjoy a sense of community. My kid was always happy and he ate well, and learnt different types of food. He was also exposed to a myriad of world knowledge at a very young age which helped him converse with adults with confidence.  If you are looking for a preschool for your little one, I will recommend you visit this center before you decide. I hope the staff stays on and the center continue to thrive., Thank you to the team at Mindchamps Chinese preschool @ Tampines.  The holistic education package has  instilled core values and skills, essential for our son to express his strengths (especially evident in the field of music and dance- special thanks to teacher Sok Mun for her unwavering dedication and passion in teaching). The team is enriched with experience to cooperate with the family as they effectively communicate on how we (as his stewards) are partners with a common objective to watch him achieve his various milestones., Observing my daughter's flourishing growth and newfound confidence at Mindchamps is truly heartening. The school not only cultivates academic excellence but also fosters the development of values and essential life skills. We appreciate the curriculum, which sparks curiosity, ignites creativity, and establishes a solid foundation for lifelong learning. The unwavering dedication of my daughter's teachers, Ms. Denise and Yu laoshi, exemplifies Mindchamps' commitment to crafting a positive and supportive educational environment. Our gratitude extends to these exceptional teachers, the enriching learning experiences, and the holistic approach that has empowered my child to blossom with confidence and joy. :), When Shan turned 18 months old, we enrolled him in the MindChamps Chinese Pre-school. Since then, everything has continued to impress us, from the top hygiene standards, to the user-friendly school application, the comprehensive curriculum, the nourishing lunch and dessert menus, the colourful activities throughout the year, and most importantly, being surrounded by teachers and staff who truly care and love the children. We have been delighted to witness the tremendous growth our son has made since entering school as he has become more independent and outgoing than ever before. Every week he surprises us with new skills and developments he has acquired in school, and he never stops giggling when we mention his teachers‚Äô names. A big shout out to Liu Laoshi and Lingling laoshi, you are rock stars! Thank you so much for taking good care of our son. The moments and pictures you share on the school app always make my day. We are also grateful to Principal Mee Lin, Yang laoshi,  teacher Aifen, teacher vivian, and many other teachers and staff for their continued care of Shan!, ‚ÄúEnzo do you want to go to school?‚Äù ‚ÄúYes!‚Äù Enzo has started school since May 2023 and he is able to quickly adapt to school. We can sense his happiness at drop off daily especially when he sees his class teachers (Liu laoshi, ling ling laoshi, Teacher Aifen) - automatically walk towards them with a smile. To us, this is the testament that he has form bonds with the teachers and he is feeling comfortable with them. The teachers also put in a lot of effort to plan the curriculum and making them engaging and interactive for the class. Enzo also becomes more independent and he will surprise us with new words and expressions! We would like to thank Mindchamps for having a pleasant and positive environment for Enzo to learn and grow. Last but not least, to all the teachers: it takes a big heart to shape little minds, thank you so much for nurturing and imparting knowledge and values to Enzo., After visiting many pre schools, we enrolled our daughter at Mindchamps Chinese@ Tampines at the age of 3, concerned about how she'll fit into school life having been at home for 2 years. It turned out way better than we expected; she enjoys school, her Mandarin has improved tremendously, and she has grown in her learning, her independence and her thinking. She is able to converse eloquently in Chinese, and comes back singing Chinese songs, where previous attempts to coach her in Mandarin at home failed. She has become more independent in her daily activities, and is learning how to interact with friends. In addition, the wonderful teachers and administrator at the school always gave us security in their care and updates on weekly activities and learning. We loved that there was no rote learning, instead learning was made fun and enjoyable for the children. It was the best decision we made that gave her an excellent headstart and look forward to sending our second child there., Having to change my daughter to MindChamps Chinese PreSchool @Tampines Central from another preschool brand which she has been for long was miraculously a breeze for us. Our first visit to the school, we were impressed with the focus of curriculum the centre offer to balance both Chinese and English learning. Ms Joyce, the Operations Director took patience to show us every detail of what the centre offers including what the centre had invested in (e.g industrial grade air purifiers, anti bacterial coating) to ensure the safety of the champs. My husband and i love the operating systems of the whole centre and communications is very up close with parents. My daughter  chat with me about how Ms Mei Lin (Principal) sit down with them to have lunch and tries to understand more about them and how patient her class teachers (Teacher Michelle and Ms Cong) is. Till date, my daughter actually forbids me to pick her up anything earlier than 630pm because she enjoys spending time in school and with her friends. Thank you MindChamps Tampines for making my daughter's K2 journey a memorable one :), We sent our boys to Mindchamps Chinese Preschool at Tampines Central from PG to N2 and we must say the quality of education and care is really excellent! The teachers are all nice, patient, engaging and show great care for the kids, and also teach them many different things. In particular, our boys have grown to learn to speak and like the Chinese language, which was a key reason we sent them to this school in the first place. Very grateful to the school principal Ms Mee Lin, Centre Director Joyce, and to all their teachers from PG to N2. Highly recommend this school to all parents!, Our daughter started attending MindChamps Chinese Preschool @ Tampines Central when she was 20 months old. We were rather concerned about sending her to school at a young age because she was not eating and sleeping well. In addition, the first few months were very difficult as she cried terribly every morning, both at home and at drop off.  We are very thankful that everyone in the school, especially Joyce, Ms Mee Lin, ÁéãËÄÅÂ∏à, Âë®ËÄÅÂ∏à, teacher Priscilla and teacher Jaymee, helped her to adapt and settle into the new environment and routine. She learned to feed herself, fall asleep on her own without pacifier and started eating and drinking very well in school within a few weeks. We are very grateful to Joyce and the teachers who send us regular updates about how well she is eating and enjoying herself in class, even after she has settled down well in school. Joyce and the teachers are also always very patient and helpful when we have questions about school.  We were surprised when the teachers and staff who do not teach our daughter are able to identify her by her name. It is very heart warming to know that every teacher and staff in school makes an effort to know every child. Thank you for being so attentive and loving towards all the children.  Our daughter has been attending school for a year now. She is conversing comfortably in both English and Mandarin and we often hear her speaking Mandarin when she is playing by herself. It is amazing to see how she has grown and matured. We look forward to see how she can continue to grow and develop at MindChamps Chinese Preschool @ Tampines Central., My son transferred from another private school, but after 5 months in Mindschamps Chinese Tampines, I honestly have nothing but praise to the school curriculum. He starts to speak with my parents in full chinese sentences and able to describe in details certain events in school., I had my daughter with Mindchamp for near 3 years. Initially, she had the habit of conversing in mandarin since i had been speaking to her at home plus the teachings in school; so she was very inclined towards speaking in mandarin, hardly any English words coming out from her..... Now noting that it is also healthy and fundamentally good for kids to start from young to be bilingual or more, my concern is resolved when Teacher Darlene and Michelle noticed that and started to guide my daughter towards conversing in English as well. After 3 months, it turns out well with my daughter now speaking English to my hubby and mandarin to me. Wonderful !, My son always brought back joys home after we pick him up from school. With just one month school experience in PG class, he likes to share with us the happenings by happily singing the song or repeating the new words learnt in school.  Thanks to the patient and caring staff at MindChamps Chinese Preschool @ Tampines Central, our boy was able to adapt to the school‚Äôs routine in a very short span of time. Now he always does look forward to going to school the next day.  We appreciate the attention paid by the teachers towards our child and the school‚Äôs effort by updating every little milestone and progress made. Impressed by the professionalism and well-organized curriculum, we feel glad to leave our child to the good hands without worries while both of us are working on full time jobs., My son has been in the MindChamps Tampines Chinese Pre School for 9 months and he has really enjoyed it. Being a Chinese school, it let him adapt quickly when he first joined with very poor English. With Teacher Darlene‚Äôs patience and kindness, he has developed his interest and confidence in both spoken and written English. He takes ÊÖ¢ÊÖ¢ËÄÅÂ∏à as a friend and  often share with me about the happenings in school. I personally highly recommend the school and I plan to send my younger son to the school soon too., Thank you again Mindchamps Chinese Preschool at Tampines for accommodating our daughter when we were back in Singapore for 2 months. It was Sophie's first experience with the Singapore education system (we live abroad) and we couldn't be happier!  Sophie felt welcomed from day 1, made a bunch of friends and improved so much in reading, writing and general knowledge.  We were also happy with the food she was getting (menu looked good at least) and loved getting updates from the Mindchamps app. Highly recommended!, Having been in a total English-speaking environment for first 4.5 years of their lives, my twins hardly knew any Chinese when they first started K1 at MindChamps Chinese Preschool, Tampines.  At the beginning, it was difficult as the environment, the routine and the language were completely new to them. However, thanks to the teachers who have been very patient and encouraging, they both settled in quickly. They also showed great improvement in understanding, speaking and writing Chinese after just a few months.  I like that the learning themes are the same for both English and Chinese lessons so they get to learn about a topic in two different languages. Rather than overlapping, the English and Chinese lessons actually complement each other. That is a brilliant way for children to pick up words in the language they are weaker in. My twins are now more confident about Chinese, in fact, they have started to speak the language voluntarily and often share with me enthusiastically the new words they learnt.  We can tell from the lesson contents and teaching materials that the teachers put in a lot of effort to engage the children. Together with the support staff, they set a cheerful, positive ambience where children can grow and develop to their full potential without fear. After all, children should feel joy in learning. I am glad we found the right school for them., ‚ÄúÂ∞èËÑö,Â∞èËÑöË∏èË∏èÔºåÊàëÁöÑÂèåËÑöË∑≥Ëµ∑Êù•ÔºÅÂ∞èÊâã,Â∞èÊâãÊãçÊãçÔºåÊàëÁöÑÂ∞èÊâã‰∏æËµ∑Êù•ÔºÅÂ∞èÊâã,Â∞èÊâãÊãçÊãçÔºåÊàëÁöÑÂ∞èÊâãËóèËµ∑Êù•ÔºÅÊâãÂú®Âì™ÈáåÔºüÊâãÂú®Âì™ÈáåÔºüÂú®ËøôÈáåÔºÅ‚Äù This is what my 3 year-old daughter Megan teaches me lately in the evening with lots of giggles and smiles.  When a child comes home and she is so eager to share with you what she has learnt in school, it just means that she is having so much fun and she wants to share the joy with us! As a parent and a teacher, I am so heartened to see this sight every evening. The curriculum in MindChamps Chinese Preschool @ Tampines Central is so robust and fun that I always look forward to the weekly updates by teachers. Even my family and friends commented that the children in this school are so fortunate as the school has such engaging activities that nurture all aspects of a child during the early years. And I couldn‚Äôt agree more.  I especially like the Gourment Moments where children are given the opportunities to observe and discuss  about food while they are taken through the steps to create simple, healthy dishes. Just recently, Megan has asked if we can make Tacos at home and she went on to tell us what are the ingredients we need and the steps in making Tacos. She has also initiated to help us in our cooking nowadays. It is evident that all the activities in school has built her confidence. I would also like to take this opportunity to commend on the team of dedicated teachers that MindChamps Chinese Preschool @ Tampines Central has. ÈÇ±ËÄÅÂ∏à always goes the extra miles to listen to my concerns and give me constructive feedback and timely updates on Megan‚Äôs progress. As a teacher myself, I know it is not easy for teachers to give the dedicated time and attention to parents and addressing to our concerns. And I am really appreciative of her efforts. I would also like to thank Âº†ËÄÅÂ∏à„ÄÅTeacher Jamie and Ms Andrea for their patience and love for Megan. All the teachers and leaders have played an important role in Megan‚Äôs learning . Thank you for seeing the good in each and every one of your children. You are appreciated!, We could not be happier with our choice of preschool. Our Son, Julien, started attending N1 at Mindchamps Chinese Preschool early in the school year - their unique curriculum placing emphasis in mandarin during the early years of childhood learning was one of the key reasons why we chose to send Julien there.  Fast forward 9 months, Julien has since flourished and has had an incredible year. He has made many new friends, experienced and learned many new and exciting things. His teachers has been wonderful in providing us updates and constant feedback as well as making Julien feel secure and confident.  From having zero knowledge in mandarin, Julien is now able to understand, converse in basic mandarin and also sing mandarin folks songs! We couldn‚Äôt be happier and more grateful for the growth we have seen in him.  The small class size ensures excellent involvement between child and teacher. His teachers‚Äô dedication, patience, creativity and gift for nurturing young minds has made his experience one of positivity and growth.  We have been extremely pleased with the cleanliness, level of care, quality and dedication of his teachers - Gu laoshi, Xin laoshi, Teacher Jaymee, Principal Ms. Mee Lin, Centre Director Ms. Joyce as well as support staffs who has made our experience flawless and seamless., Kudos to the school which has so successfully provided a nurturing environment for my daughter to grow in, piquing her curiosity and encouraging experiential learning. She has built up a network of wonderful friends and supportive teachers, whom she looks forward to interacting with everyday. The curriculum is calibrated around interesting themes, making the learning process much more enjoyable for her. Her teachers are also very caring and thoughtful which made a positive difference to her well-being, checking in on her when she misses school, indulging in her endless queries and ensuring she is well taken care of, something which many Mindchamp parents can surely identify with., Ever since Jamie attended N1 classes in Mindchamps, her communication skills has improved tremendously. She is now able to express herself in mandarin and in sentences of what she needs. Jamie has became more independent in performing mundane tasks by herself like getting dressed for school, having meals and brushing teeth which are milestones that any parents would be delighted with. My husband and I firmly believes that with the holistic approach by Mindchamps and the teaching passion of the teachers(ÈªÑËÄÅÂ∏àÔºå¬†ÂàòËÄÅÂ∏à¬†& Teacher Jaymee), Jamie has greatly improved not only in terms of well being of herself but she has displayed compassion towards other people around her. She would offer to soothe her younger sibling if he is crying, or share her food.  We would like to express our heartfelt¬†thanks in what the Teachers have done thus far, and we‚Äôve never been more happy in our decision to place Jamie in Mindchamps. Ë∞¢Ë∞¢ÈªÑËÄÅÂ∏àÔºå¬†ÂàòËÄÅÂ∏à¬†& Teacher Jaymee!, We are very happy with our choice of Mindchamps Chinese Preschool @ Tampines as the preschool for our son Zachary. His mandarin abilities have grown by leaps and bounds and he constantly surprises us by the phrases he uses and the words he can recognize. He is also learning good English, e.g. articulating that it should be ‚Äúrunny nose‚Äù and not ‚Äúrunning nose‚Äù.  His teachers are dedicated, creative, caring and encouraging and make the effort to personally update us periodically on Zachary‚Äôs progress.  We are delighted to see our son grow not only intellectually and in confidence but also in social skills, character and life skills in the course of attending school. As perhaps the best testament to the school‚Äôs success, Zachary tells us that he ‚Äúsuper loves‚Äù school and looks forward to going to school ‚Äúeveryday, even on weekends‚Äù because he can ‚Äúlearn a lot of things‚Äù. He also enjoys playing with his classmates and often shares about their daily interactions with a twinkle in his eye.  Thank you to the principal, teachers and helpers in school for helping to create a wonderful learning environment!, We enrolled our kids into the school as we are specifically wanted them to be immersed in a Mandarin speaking environment. I believe the software is the most important in the set-up of a school. No matter how new the hardware or fanciful the school is, the teachers and staff make it different. Good teachers are hard to come by and I am glad to have found them in this school!, The decision to enrol Jayne in February to MindChamps chinese pre-school Tampines could not have been a better one. The enrolment process was seamless and director Joyce and Principal Mee Lin had been extremely patient and detailed in explaining the curriculum and the Pre-school philosophy to us. We were impressed with the structure and the rigor built into the school curriculum, balancing the academic and character development aspects of the champ. Special thanks to Teacher Wei, Teacher Melodie, Teacher Chiu and Teacher Darlene for their patience towards Jayne. They took the extra effort to help Jayne catch up with her curriculum during breaks or when time permits as Jayne only joined mid- term and may be lacking in some areas. We noticed that Jayne has improved a lot academically and she is now more confident and a happier champ that looks forward to going to school daily. Thank you!  From: Shawn & Catherine üòä, Coming from English speaking family, my son has picked up quite alot of mandarin words since he started PG few months ago and uses them regularly at home. One afternoon he ran up to me and said ‚ÄòMommy, wo ai nie‚Äô. That was his first sentence in mandarin at 21months old. Days later he came up to me on the bed and said ‚Äòqi lai‚Äô while pulling my hand. It was always a pleasant surprise each time  he said something in mandarin but mainly, im impressed he knew how to apply them. In my opinion, the teachers have done well in teaching the kids not just the words but the right application as well. I can definitely see the knowledge difference between him and a friend‚Äôs kid who is older and in different school. Apart from academic, the teachers and staffs are very caring and welcoming too, giving us parents a sense of assurance that our kids are in good hands ‚ù§Ô∏è, Zung Hee was a quiet boy when it comes to participation in class and in front of people. During his past 5-6 months in Mindchamps, we had being working with the teachers to check on my son's progress in class. I like the way the MindChamps teachers engage the students actively in class by asking them questions and getting the student to participate by answering.  Through the active feedback from his teachers and the encouragement received, Zung Hee is now able to come home to tell us how he participated actively in class by raising his hands to answer questions. He also appears to be more confident when speaking. Many thanks to our dear MindChamps teachers for their passion and encouragement. We look forward for a better growth within Zung Hee by working closely with teachers., I am very glad that I have enrolled my girl at MindChamps Chinese Preschool at Tampines Central. The principal and teachers are committed and passionate about teaching Chinese cultures and values to the kids, which is so valuable. The centre director is always within reach of the parents and provides timely response. Alot of proactiveness from the centre can be observed through constant regular updates of class activities, health matters etc. My girl who is now in Primary one, has no problem adapting to primary school so far as the teachers and school curriculum have prepped and given them a very good foundation., Alexander has been in Mindchamps Chinese PreSchool @ Tampines Central for the past 2 years. I would like to commend and send my heartfelt thanks to all the dedicated teachers, Principal Mee Lin, and Centre Director Joyce for their unwavering devotion to the children. An immersive language environment is irreplaceable for foundation setting towards mastery of a language and Alexander has had the fortunate advantage of receiving this in Mindchamps Chinese PreSchool. The teachers have an excellent command of English and Mandarin and have clearly been selected not just for their teaching and language abilities, but for their maturity and gentle natures. Centre director Joyce and Principal Mee Lin have been very hands-on with regards to the children‚Äôs care and education in class, something that I know does not come by in every preschool. The school and its teachers have provided such a warm and close-knit environment for learning for Alexander, and he looks forward to literally every single school day!  A special ‚ÄúThank you!‚Äù to ÂàòËÄÅÂ∏àfor starting Alexander‚Äôs day ever so cheerfully during the morning health checks, Teacher Renu for being the most kind and encouraging English teacher, and ‰ΩçËÄÅÂ∏à for doing such a great job in instilling the love for Chinese language and culture in my little one. Alexander loves reading both English and Chinese books, something not present in Singapore children nowadays, and I have the school to thank, for his love of both English and Chinese, and his insatiable love for learning., Really glad to have chosen this school. The school has good, nurturing, and empathetic staff, including the principal, teachers and all support staff who genuinely care for the children.  The communications are very clear and everyone is very professional and engaging.  It was a pleasure to have my child there for 4 years. The school has certainly laid the right foundation my for child in terms of Chinese culture and language and the love for learning in general., Moyan has joined MindChamps Chinese Preschool Tampines for 5 months now and  we‚Äôre pleased that we made the right choice. As Moyan is used to speaking Cantonese only at home, she encountered lots of challenges at school initially. We‚Äôd like to express our great gratitude to Ms Mee Lin, PG teacher Ms Chang, Ms Liang and Ms Jaymee who helped Moyan went through this very challenging period. Moyan adapted to school very fast with their help and guidance and also made great progress with Mandarin speaking. We‚Äôre also satisfied with the well-balanced curriculum of learn and play. Moyan has been very much involved in various kinds of activities at school.  We‚Äôre  also thankful to her current N1 teachers Ms Wong and Ms Gu who are encouraging and accommodating., Good nurturing teachers who really helped my kid to develop her Mandarin vocabulary, and helped her transition off diapers and weaning off the milk bottle feeding. Centre Director has a strong focus on cleanliness and hygiene which is greatly appreciated during the Covid-19 times and Principal is patient and open to taking on feedback well., My elder girl started school at Mindchamps Chinese Preschool @ Tampines Central as a N1 Champ and is now into her 4th year in K2. Our precious little girl will be graduating very soon, which is such a poignant moment. She has grown up so much over the last 4 years! From a shy little girl who cannot even go up and down the steps properly to now where she can speak confidently and has her own mind; overcoming her fear of slides; and even taking great care of her little sister who is now in the N1 class, she has blossomed into a young little lady. Her change has been amazing. We recall the days when she could not even hold her scissors and pencil properly and now she could write both English and Chinese words beautifully (when she puts her mind to it!).  One of her biggest improvement is in the Chinese language. She has always been and still is an ‚ÄúEnglish speaking‚Äù girl and not a big fan of Chinese. At one point, her grandparents were concerned that she does not seem to understand Chinese, but now, she can reply in simple Mandarin. We were all impressed that she could recite ‚ÄúËØóËØç‚Äù and sing some Chinese songs. Her Chinese writing also improved a lot and when I see her master the Chinese spelling every week now, I am really grateful to all her teachers. We can see her improve bit by bit and I am sure this is due to the foundation laid over the years.  Her sister is in N1 now, and has already spent about 2 years in the school. Her development is also amazing. In the early days, she would cry every day when we send her to school but now she loves all her teachers and friends. She even tell me she has ""babies"" in school (i.e. newbies in her class) and she is a ""big girl"" now. Initially she is also reluctant to speak Mandarin but now I hear she can converse well in Mandarin. She has also grown more independent now and really loves performing.  Both of them have very positive experience and development in the school and we never regretted our decision to enrol them in MindChamps Chinese Preschool @ Tampines Central. Although there were several changes of teachers through the years, they always love their teachers. Thanks to all the teachers and staff of the school for giving the girls such a wonderful foundation for life., Very thankful to have chosen this school for my child. Very high standard of teachers and principal. Wonderful and clean environment for the children to play, learn, eat and sleep in. A very nurturing principal who is always ready to listen. Directors of the school are friendly and approachable., The team is great with dedicated teachers that makes learning fun and enjoyable for the children. Environment are very well kept and hygiene was never a concern., My girl has graduated and shared she missed her pre-school. That tells alot, is it? Thanks Mindchamps Chinese Preschool Tampines!, Dedicated and professional teachers. Kudos to the teachers., We had chosen MindChamps Chinese Preschool @ Tampines as we wanted our son to learn Mandarin as his first language. We love that the enrichment programmes are conducted in Chinese. The communication between parents and teachers is open and consistent, providing insights into our child's daily activities and progress.  School facilities are clean, organized, and equipped with age-appropriate materials. We appreciate the attention to detail in creating an environment where children can explore and learn in a secure setting. The dedication of the teachers and staff is commendable especially Yang ËÄÅÂ∏à and Wen Hui ËÄÅÂ∏à., Since enrolling in Mindchamp Chinese Kindergarten in July 2020, I have received a good education in both Chinese and English. We are very grateful to Teacher Liu, Teacher Huang, Teacher Ping, Teacher Darlene and Teacher Jaymee for their careful teaching, which has enabled the children to make great progress in many aspects.  We have found that teachers are effective in motivating children to learn. For example, she often takes out a pen and paper after coming home from school and practices writing the letters and numbers she learned in school. It can be seen that she is very interested in what the teachers have taught her. I am very grateful to the teachers for taking the time to regularly organize and send the content they have learned to parents, so that we can consolidate and strengthen the knowledge we have learned at home in a timely manner.  In addition, teachers are also very interactive with children during the teaching process. For example, when learning about insects, children are very interested in the transformation process of caterpillars, and their related Chinese and English vocabulary has also increased a lot. We also started trying to feed the caterpillars at home. The first thing we did after returning home every day was to visit and observe them. We were very interested. Our parents and children learned and gained a lot of knowledge about feeding caterpillars together in this process. At the same time, I am very grateful to the teachers for their patience and timely guidance.  During the past year or so of learning at Mindchamp, we have seen significant progress in our children. Under the guidance of teachers, children have developed a strong interest not only in Chinese and English, but also in nature and science. At the same time, her personality gradually became lively and cheerful, she made many good friends in the class, and she also enjoyed sharing the handicrafts she made at home with her teachers. Seeing the progress of our children in school, we also enrolled my sister in Doudou Class half a year ago, so that she can learn and grow happily with her sister every day., Lingzhi followed her sister's footsteps and joined Mindchamps in 2018, starting from PG until K2. Lingzhi‚Äôs sister, Lingxi, entered Mindchamps in 2016 and also graduated from PG until kindergarten. She is the ‚Äúkindergarten-building generation‚Äù of Mindchamps Chinese. Ganoderma really likes the clean and bright environment of Mindchamps and the warm and friendly teachers. She likes to go to kindergarten very much. She said that she has her favorite teacher and best friend in kindergarten. Ganoderma learned a lot of knowledge in kindergarten, from natural sciences to language arts, music and dance, musical instruments, etc. Under the influence of various enrichment programs at Mindchamps, a five-year-old child has learned the ability to think independently and also cultivated Show cheerful personality. Lingzhi often said, ""I love Teacher Michelle, the English classes she teaches are very interesting, and I like to listen to them; I love Teacher Lidong, she teaches me to read Chinese story books, and she teaches me to recognize many words; I love Teacher Congcong, she He will tell me what I am doing wrong, and I will get better; I love Teacher Chang. Teacher Chang will accompany us after school and wait for our parents to pick us up, and will play games with us.‚Äù‚Ä¶ We know that at Mindchamps, there are also There are many teachers, uncles and aunts who care about and love her. We are very glad to have chosen Mindchamps, and sincerely thank Ms Mee Lin, Ms Joyce, all the teachers and staff for their patience and meticulous love for our children."
MindChamps Performing Arts PreSchool @ Changi Business Park,"Wonderful preschool! As a working mum, the staff and teachers at Mindchamps CBP make it so easy for me to juggle work commitments without having to worry about my child's well being and development.  Perfect outdoor and indoor location where kids have a dedicated area for waterplay and their own playground! This was important to us as we wanted our child to spend time in the sun too! Teachers also incorporated learning in the outdoor play to help kids to truly understand concepts.  Teachers are prompt in responding to parents and always see themselves as a team with parents. This is a wonderful way of raising kids. In PG and Nursery, the focus is very much on social skills and interacting well with others while still keeping up with academic developments. In kindergarten, teachers focus on building independence with the kids and preparing them for primary school. Mindchamps CBP also has drama, ballet and music classes so kids are kept actively engaged in their interests.  Food menus are shared with parents in advanced so you know what your kids are being fed. Always lovingly cooked fresh and kids also have sessions where they try their hand at preparing simple dishes.  We absolutely love having our child here! She's really developed very well and we can see that she really enjoys school!, We‚Äôve sent both our children here (transferred from another kindergarten) and it was the best move we‚Äôve made for their growth and development.  The teachers have been patient, kind and understanding, and our little ones have always felt at home under their care.  Staffing ratio is extremely generous, with different teachers for reading and writing, english, chinese, drama and music.  Immensely grateful to this wonderful team who gave our children a strong head start in life., Completed my practicum for my diploma studies with MindChamps @ CBP. I initially planned to do my 3 practicums at different early childhood centres to gain more insight but after having gone through the first one with exceeding expectations, I decided to complete the other 2 with them as well. I sincerely appreciated the working environment there as the Principal, Teachers and other staff were welcoming and I could approach them with ease to answer any questions I have. They were really supportive throughout my time there and guided me through, even offering assistance for my on-site evaluation if needed which I am really thankful for.

The interactions between the teachers and students were really positive and respectful which contributed to the overall environment and atmosphere of the school which i really liked and enjoyed., I'm extremely thankful for the sincere support my son has received at Mindchamps Preschool. My son, diagnosed with high-functioning ASD, has been attending both Mindchamps Preschool and Mindchamps Allied Care since 2020. Ms. Anu and the teachers have been incredibly supportive on my son's educational journey. They have consistently supported his development and helped him maximize his strengths. They collaborate closely with the therapists, creating an inclusive environment for children with mild to moderate challenges. I am deeply grateful for their passion and dedication in assisting us."", My daughter was part of Mindchamps. She loved every day of school. Teachers and school environment is wonderful. Even after moving out she went back to meet all her teachers.  As a working mother, i dint have to worry about my daughter.Daily updates and pictures from school, keep us involved with them.  I would recommend Mindchamps to others parents. Thank you!, My children are in N2 and K2 this year, and they love going to preschool everyday. Their teachers are dedicated and passionate in nurturing young children, always putting their interests first. The reading & writing module has been well executed, building strong literacy foundation since PG. Teacher-parent communication is constantly ongoing, principal-parent feedback is always available. Generally a strong team of educators in this preschool. Great outdoor space for play and learning, indoor space is however rather limited. Looking forward to more milestones with the team of teachers teaching my children., Most trusted preschool for my kids‚Äô education and well-being for coming to a decade now. Quality teachers who are passionate, energetic and patient. Easy communication with the teachers with frequent updates and photos posted via the Mindchamps App. Kids are well-equipped with skills for entering primary school.

Our child  has always enjoyed going to Mindchamps and looks forward to interacting with his classmates and teachers.  The teachers throughout his Mindchamps journey has been nothing but wonderful. Caring, loving and with a passion to nurture, our child has blossomed in the time he has spent with them. The school environment is very clean and hygienic, school culture warm and welcoming. The outdoor area is a major plus point for us when choosing a preschool as we very much wanted outdoor play for our child. The outdoor space also doubles up as learning venue for a different kind of exposure and learning experience for the kids.  The Mindchamps programmes are very interesting and we appreciate that they encourage exploratory learning with the kids. Themes are set through each term with activities focusing  around the various themes. Lessons as I hear from our child are interesting, lively and very enjoyable. It‚Äôs a brilliant way for young minds to learn. Kudos to the teachers for always going the extra mile to creatively impart knowledge.  Feedback from us parents are taken seriously and always addressed promptly which is something we appreciate a lot. Parent teacher conferences are held periodically on top of the updates we get on our child. This is always welcomed - afterall it is a partnership between us parents and teachers.  It is hard to say goodbye to such a great preschool. Our son speaks very fondly still of his preschool days and has asked for frequent visits back. It has been one of our best decisions to enrol him in Mindchamps!, My daughter went to the Mindchamps cbp centre for nearly 1.5 years. She loved the daycare and the teachers and enjoyed participating in all the fun and learning activities. We appreciated the time and effort the staff took to understand and attend to each kid every day. Would have continued with mindchamps till she started school if we had not moved!, MindChamps CBP has a team of dedicated teachers led by Principal Anu- who put in their hearts to nurture young minds. Our experience with the school, has been nothing but amazing- right from highlighting details about the child‚Äôs progress and potential, to encouraging the child with patience every step of the way-the teachers have always had and have ‚Äòthe child first‚Äô policy.  Aside the learning and thinking skills imparted, when combined with dance and drama (also an integrated part of the curriculum), truly ensures that the child is blossoming comprehensively- and what‚Äôs more, these are not empty words- we can vouch as a first hand experience of this with our child :).  Asides this, what we also really like about the infrastructure/ space of this school - is that unlike a few other preschools which are located in malls etc- this one has a playground- which is really great as the kids can get to be in a more ‚Äúnatural‚Äù environment while the teachers oversee all the play activities.  Finally, a very important factor in considering MindChamps CBP has always been how welcoming, engaged and receptive the whole team is right from the start- they always allays any concerns and address any questions the parents may have and this give us the confidence to know that our child is in a safe and conducive environment geared for growth., My daughter has been studying here for three years.

I used to have the impression that MC might be too taxing for young kids due to their reputation for being more academic. But reality is, the content is delivered in a fun and informative manner, and I can see a significant improvement in her within a mere few months. Most importantly, she enjoys school thoroughly and specifically asked us to fetch her late so she can spend more time in school.

It‚Äôs greatüëç, This is the fifth year that we have been working with Mindchamps day and night. My two sons graduated here respectively. I am very grateful to Mindchamps for accompanying my children, and I am also grateful to myself for making the most suitable choice for my children at the right time.  The school has a strong teaching system and teachers have great teaching ambitions. They spend every bit of time to give the children the best possible enlightenment, from imparting knowledge and culture to taking care of them between meals and classes. They lead by example and strive for excellence. The results of their words and deeds can be clearly seen in the lives of the children.  For us, what is particularly worth mentioning is the progress of the children‚Äôs Chinese language. I believe that many Chinese families have similar troubles, and there are certain deficiencies in the Chinese language in an English-speaking environment. Listening, speaking, reading and writing are a very important language development period between the ages of 3 and 6. For children whose native language is English, learning another cumbersome language seems very difficult. I sincerely thank the teachers at Mindchamps for allowing my children to experience happiness in learning and continue to grow in happiness.  I have to say it again: the spring breeze turns into rain, moistening things silently. grateful!"

MindChamps PreSchool @ Tanglin,"Enrolled my 2 year old boy at Mindchamps Tanglin a few months ago. While our boy has enjoyed the learning activity and the teachers were good, we have FIRMLY decided to WITHDRAW him. Numbers of toddlers increased to quite many in a classroom. When it does, becomes a bit messy. Few occasions came home with other toddler‚Äôs personal belongings, own belongings being mixed up with others. Also, Heartbreaking to keep seeing my kid getting sick and even one occasion had to be hospitalised for few days. Had mentioned to principal that they should be more vigilant, triage those with URTI symptoms carefully and encourage those who are sick to stay home and not still go school to prevent spread, especially during this criticial covid situation., The passion, attention and care from the staff and teachers are amazing. I love that they paid extra attention to my kid who joined the school really late in the year to make sure he assimilated well, and my husband and I are super grateful of the constant updates, especially in the first 2 weeks.  The progress we can see in just 2 weeks is amazing. From getting my child to ditch his diapers to finally holding his pen correctly to him being more interested in homework to learning to change his own clothes. What's even more astonishing is that he can write A to Z on his own now. All in just 2 weeks!  Thank you Ms Naz, Wang ËÄÅÂ∏à, Chun Xia, Ms Zarni, Ms Sarah and everyone at Mindchamps Tanglin!, Our kid, Andre from N2 enjoys going to school everyday because the teachers are very friendly, attentive, patient and gentle with him. He has a lot of fun in school everyday. It is easy to communicate with school and teachers for any concern too. Thank you for everything :), Chinese is not our native language. However, we believe that we should give to out kids  the opportunity to learn Chinese, given the high and increasing importance of the language.  We chose MindChamps over other preschools in our area mainly because it offers a Chinese preschool, which gives more emphasis on the Chinese language, not only through academic lessons but also through the daily activities. We believe that the kids should ‚Äòplay‚Äô a lot and that school is meant to be fun for the kids. So MindChamps fits the bill as the curriculum is very structured, with a good balance between academic and non-academic aspects.

Only draw back the fees are above average, We were exploring a few options for our child and this branch at Mindchamps Zhongshan gave us the most assurances that our child is in good hands. The principal Ms Ginn was prompt in her replies and generous with her time, her experience and strong awareness of the needs of the children evident. The environment also came across as really conducive and well-maintained, which are important factors for us before we decide to put our kid in., Ever since the change of management , mindchamps zhongshan park has made a lot of improvements.

We see the signs of learning for Shaan and the structure has been helpful for him., Had fun visiting Chinatown and kid learn Chinese traditions., My son has learnt a lot during this 1 year with MindChamps. Sometimes he surprised us by suddenly speaking certain vocabulary  we didn‚Äôt teach him at home, and showing certain skills such as recognizing the time on the clock and using scissors.

He receives words of encouragement from the teachers which made him very proud., As a parent, I want what is best for my child. That is why I choose MindChamps@ Zhongshan Park for my daughter.

As a parent I am assured my child is taken care of with the teachers!, The teachers there are dedicated and truly care for the kids; the environment is clean and the place is truly well-run. Be warned however that fees are not cheap. In the end this is a corporation and their primary objective is their profit margin - personally had a very bad experience with their administrative staff and subsequent attempts at service recovery. Doesn't take away from the good work the teachers do though so keep it up., My kid loves school, that's all the matters, The Spring Festival outings are wonderful, Dedicated teachers admin and support staffs.

Modern Montessori Preschool Centre (368 Bukit Batok St 31),"My son has been with the school for 4 years now and we‚Äôve been really happy with this school. We had the privilege of experiencing 2 principals and both have been super hands on, which is important to us as they walk the talk. In the morning and evening, principal Ms Ima is there to greet and send off the children. It is also easy to communicate with her and to review my child‚Äôs growth thanks to her presence at the center.  Teachers here are thoughtful and sincere in their care and teaching of the children. They have the child‚Äôs development at heart and this is hard to find as I believe most teachers are hit with a fatigue given the general shortage of teachers now.  For example, even during school trips, Ms Deborah goes above and beyond to prepare for any mishaps (e.g. preparing extra uniforms for the children), which I really appreciate after a child (mine) went wild to play in the rain.  I‚Äôm not sure about other methodologies but the Montessori method has greatly taught my son independence in his conduct at home and I‚Äôm super grateful for that. Can‚Äôt wait to send my daughter to MMI Bukit Batok when she turn 18 months old!, Qualified staff, our daughter learned a lot on this preschool, was with them for 4 years"
Modern Montessori Preschool Centre (6 Bright Hill Dr),"Update: The centre called me back 3 more times, each time I told them I'm not interested already, stop calling me. Really glad I didn't enrol my kid here.  Made an appointment online for centre visit, no response. Called them over the phone, the admin person has poor communication skills. She said cannot visit on a particular day at 9.30am that I suggested, because ""there's an acitivity going on"". I asked, how about after 3pm. She said it's the kids' nap time, can't see much. I had to clarify can also be 4pm. She hemhawed a bit, then changed her reasoning to, ""because they cannot make it"". I asked who ""they"" are, she then said ""they"" is the centre principal, who just texted her to say whole of that day cannot tour the centre. I already explained I'm a working mother with limited days of leave,i already took leave that day to tour another childcare centre nearby, she just kept suggesting other dates without regard for my schedule. I would understand if that date I suggested is not available if you would just clearly state the reason. But she gave me a bunch of vague reasons that just kept changing as the conversation progressed. If this is the standard of communication with parents of existing students, I am glad I avoided putting my child with them., This place is the best so many exciting activities to do here. When I was here I took part of the weekly rollerblading ( tho I am not sure whether they still have that tho). When I was in k1 we also had a class pet. The teachers are very kind and nurturing. Totes recommend.‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è, Proper Montessori school and curriculum but terrible communication and zero visibility on what goes on at school from parents‚Äô perspective. Minimal to zero outdoor time. No willingness to ‚Äòwork‚Äô with parents together. Would not recommend."

I have both my kids attending this school and truthfully speaking the teachers and principal go over and above in caring and nurturing the children. Curriculum activities are ever educational and fun. This school also has an array of outdoor activities to engage the children. We had like more than 5 outdoors activities this year already.  Both my kids 4 and 6 years old now always speaks their mind. They misses the school teachers and friends on weekends and always says ""i want to go school!""  They are a living testament of the great and hard work the school has done for them.  From the bottom of my heart, Thank you to all teachers and Principal of  Blk 135/138 Simei St 1, My husband and I greatly appreciate the good partnership and constant engagement that we had with the principal and teachers here at MFS. They are very kind, nurturing and friendly.  They always have our children‚Äôs best interests at heart. The assessments that the teachers made for our children‚Äôs development had given us better perspective in guiding our children to learn through play according to their learning style.  The good thing about being a smaller centre (with appropriate teacher-student ratio, nonetheless) is that we knew all of the teachers as they often interacted with our children, even though they don‚Äôt belong to their class. The centre greatly encourages parental involvement through school trips, festive celebrations as well as DIY craft homework from time to time, which we enjoyed being part of.  Due to shifting of residence, we had to send our children to a different MFS centre. But MFS @ 135/138 Simei St 1 will always be the best and the most special in our hearts. We are very certain that our sons grew up with the best memories here., Teachers are really kind, helpful and nurturing. My son enjoying himself in the school.

My First Skool (192 Toa Payoh Lor 4),"My daughter, Clara has been in 192 TPY MFS since Jan 2018. 5 years now, I would say that Clara has improved alot in her speech, motor skills and communication, most importantly, she has becoming more independent. These credits should all goes to the team of Committed & Dedicated Wonderful Teachers in 192 Toa Payoh MFS . They have lots of e-learning programmes for different ages and zoom events on special occasions which really brings the bonding between the children, parents & teachers together. As a parents, I would highly recommend MFS to all my friends & relatives. Lastly, Thank You Very Much to Ms Jesie (Principal), all Teachers & Aunties for all your hard work & contribution to the children., Was really impressed when my child was in infant group. But things just got worst. My child had HFMD twice. Teachers kept picking on children bag, no snacks allowed, not even one or two wrapped biscuits. Teachers has no respect for parents. Witness teachers asking parents to scold the child at the waiting area, force the kids to apologise and even threw out things from the child's bag on the floor. Scolded parents for bringing too much items. When they barely walked 10 sec into the classrooms. Do not understand why isn't the focus on learning instead? It's really a disappointment., Both my children enrolled from infant class till graduated. Received updates on them on their daily growth when fetching them.  Noticed the kiddos on table manners. when food is served, they will thank you, cleaned the table when food/drink was spilled, bring their cutlery to kitchen/sink when finished.  During K2, preparation to primary 1, they were taught to understand the time/clock, learned/count coins, tie shoe laces and many more‚Ä¶  Thumbs up for all the loving and caring staff in my first skool 192 Toa Payoh, My children (K1 and toodler) have a very positive experience at My First Skool Toa Payoh branch and they enjoy going school every day. The center is spacious, bright and clean. My kids take part in a variety of fun and interactive activities. The curriculum is very wide and also have enrichment classes. I can see that their teachers are very dedicated, knowledgeable and caring. They keep us updated on their development and milestones. Thank you!, My two kids graduated from My First Skool at Blk 192 Toa Payoh in 2019 and 2021, have become more confident and independent under the care of the teachers. The teachers have prepared them for primary school well before they are graduated, making sure they are familiar with the primary school routine. This process has made it easy for their transition and to face the challenges in the new school environment; this can't be made possible without the help of the school teachers and principal, especially for their care and dedication to the students! I will highly recommend this preschool to my fellow friends and relative., Both of my kids are enrolled at this center and enjoyed the learning journeys in the school. At every opportunity, Ms Jessie will engaged the parents to gather feedbacks and shared new initiatives the centre will be launching. Teachers and staffs are always welcoming the children when they arrives making them feels safe and value. My kids learning journey in the school had prepared them during the transition to primary school. They enjoyed every moments during their time in the school. üëçüèªüëçüèª, My kids started their journey from infant care. Teachers and staff are passionate in what they do. Love that kids learn through play in this center. Learning is fun for them and they will always share with us what they have learnt in school enthusiastically. The show and tell sessions build up kids confidence. Preparation for kids to transition to P1 is very well done too. They learn how to count money, buy food, tell the time and many more. Communication is open and we get timely updates on our kids development. Have recommended several friends to My First Skool as we have awesome experience with them and my friends love it too., This is my daughter's first school experience with MFS in Singapore. All the teachers and support staff here are very cheerful, helpful and supportive. They help my daughter to overcome all the anxiety and adapt to school environment. Now she is enjoying school life, more independent and hands on compare to before send her to school. Besides that, her language development improving within 3 months which surprised us a lot and now she tried to communicate more in English. We are happy to send our daughter there and appreciate all the Teachers hardwork., My girl Ashlyn has been with this centre since Infantcare and now transitioned to toddler. The teachers at both infant and toddler are great, caring and experienced. My daughter had difficulties adjusting initially but both side teachers are patient and came up with various ways to make her transition smoother. Now she loves attending school and misses her teachers and friends when she is unable to be in school.  Curriculum wise is also really good and my girl really learned a lot from school., My children enrolled in MFS 192 Toa Payoh since toddler/ playgroup. My eldest son graduated from the centre last year. We love the pre-school compound with its very own courtyard and gardens. Children are safe to play around the courtyard during the good days. Classrooms are spacious and well ventilated. Principal and teachers are passionate and dedicated to give their very best to all the children. We are happy to see our children enjoying themselves with wonderful memories during their pre-school days with the centre!, Amazing staff with so much heart and caring mindset! All the teachers are awesome. My 2 children started attending the childcare since toddler till graduated and recently my 3rd child started attending, he has been enjoying it.  I deeply appreciate the staff being nice and caring, and the principal really cares about the children and works with the parents., Our journey started when my son is enrolled into MFS at blk 192 Toa Payoh when he was a toddler. I have had very good experiences with the teachers and staff at the centre as they are very friendly yet professional. My boy also enjoys his time in school and is always looking forward to going school.  His teachers are very friendly and proactive. They tend to update what has happended during the day and should there be any emergency, we would be informed almost immediately. His communication book is also filled with pictures with description of what has been done in school. I am glad that that my son has learnt a lot and is an independent and responsible boy. We can see his growth (cognitive and affective) and hope he continues to develop his leadership skills in school (like he was given opportunties to be buddy eith new comers etc). Work is not overload (they are homework sometimes as form of parental bonding) and there are also additional Saturday zoom classes for both parents and pupils.  His teachers are also patience yet strict and ensured that the right values are taught to the children. It was clearly eveident when my boy had a few tantrums/incidents with friends and teachers are there to guide them to solve the issues.  During PTMs, teachers are also truthful (sound out both postive and negative behaviours and seek ways to help my boy to improve. Their app/portal and portfolio are also very detailed with their curriculum and it helps when i need to reinforce his learning.  Overall, I am thankful for their utmost dedication and work to educating our children. Highly recommended centre!, My 2 elder children have graduated from MFS and are currently in P2 and P1 now. My youngest is now attending playgroup at MFS. The teachers are dedicated and fun, all my children love going to school and love their teachers. This is important and take a huge load off us. There is weekly updates on the school portal of the kids and also frequent updates on the kids's progress by the teachers whenever we picked the kids up. This is something that we appreciated as it helps us to attune our approach with the kids at home.   The school and teachers also prepare them well for the transition to Primary 1. Both my elder children are eager to buy food from the canteen as they said they have learnt to do so in MFS and are excited to choose and buy their own food. We are happy that the kids have wonderful times and memories during their times there., An amazing childcare or infant care provide learning journey from 2 months infant till kindergarden. Some of the key point compliment to school. 1. We have been very impressed with the quality of care and teaching to our love one. 2. We especially appreciate with MyFirstSkool TPC because they keep in close communication with parents. 3. Endless learning journey due to lot of activities to build relationships between parents, teacher and child. 4. As parents, we are continuously amazed at how much our daughter has learned and grown, and this is certainly in no small part due to the nurturing environment that the school provides., What's every parent's nightmare? When your child wakes up and starts crying that they do not want to go to school. Fortunately, the teacher and student bond this school has has saved me sweat (and threats) and my daughters' tears. Going to school is like duck to water and I believe it is the work of the teachers and the environment that made it so much easier for me. Every child grows to improve in any school especially at such a tender age but not every teacher in all schools can hold a special place in a child's heart. It takes a strong leader, like principal Jessie, to hold the team together. I've heard horror stories of very high turnover rates, but in here, I've seen most of the teachers still here in our short stay of 2yrs plus. When I spoke to some, they have been teaching here for more than 5yrs, a few 10yrs or more! Talk about experience and assurance. üëçüèª, Both my children started in this centre since infant days. Not only are the staff friendly and caring, the teachers' turnover rate is low as well. I get regular updates on my children during pick up/drop offs on top of their weekly updates from the school app.  My 2nd just started about a year ago but my 1st has been with the centre for 5 years. On some days, my 1st will share or demonstrate to us his learnings from school and all these little moments are enough to make any parents proud of their children. His Chinese improved significantly too under the guidance of his teachers.  Pandemic is such an unprecedented time but this centre has done well in adjusting to and implementing new SOP and measures to keep  our children as safe as possible. We also love their efforts in consistently conducting centre based/network based home learnings!, School is conveniently located and accessible by both public and private transport. My children are nurtured by the teachers in a conducive environment teaching them independence, communication and social skills. School has their own in-house outdoor play area for play, gardening, etc. Teachers are also friendly, approachable and caring whom the kids sang praises about. See ya there!, My girl has been with MFS since infant class. The experience is great. All the teachers and staff are friendly and responsible. Each time we ask our girl how she feels about the school, she always tell us that she likes her Teachers and friends a lot. We are glad that we enrolled her in MFS 192 and happy to see her grow up in this wonderful place., My son loves going to My First Skool. He enjoys the school programmes very much. You know he is well taken care and you can trust the Teachers when he comes home happy and looking forward to go school again the next day., My child had been in this school from Playgroup to K2.

They respond quickly to any of parents enquiries and most of the teachers has been with the center for more than 5 yrs. The center principal is very friendly and often see her in the center attending to the kids., Located at a corner of TPY central and on the 2nd floor, this pre-school is accessible yet quiet and away from the crowd as compared to those centres located at the void deck.  The centre focuses on the holistic development of the children. This means that it may not be as academically focused as some pre-schools. There are enrichment classes conducted by external vendors during school time that the kids can sign up to further their interests (fees apply)  The teachers and staff are attentive and caring towards the little ones and will constantly provide the parents with updates of the child‚Äôs progress. This is something we parents could not have asked for more., Have sent both my kids to this centre for past few years. Love the teachers dedication, creativity and dedication when it comes to the kids. The center premises are also very good best part is the courtyard which allows the kids to have outdoor time in a safe, Loved that the kids learn through play at MFS and there is no spelling and Âê¨ÂÜô for them. They get to enjoy their preschool thoroughly yet they also learn to blend and spell ,recognise words and learn about maths and simple science., The experience was how I imagined my parents felt when my brothers and I were also schooled at the same school 30 years ago., Our little one is having lots of fun in My First Skool, learning new things everyday, socialising with other children, playing, drawing and dancing together. We love the home learning activities where the families can bond together with the teachers and other families. We are grateful for the love and care for our little.

Is belong to government, why need to complain & call officers to come down to fine us when we park along the road side? We didn‚Äôt block any traffic there, so more there is a construction site, for the seek & heartful for others, we will hunt your school & make sure you don‚Äôt make mistakes, we will write in to MOM & call the authorities to come to your school to check., Bad experience with school. It may have the hardware but is very lacking in the ""software"". Have been in and out of the principal office numerous times within a span of 10 mths.  Lapses in multiple areas such as basic hygiene, child safety issues, rough handling of kids, improper feeding practice and lastly no management oversight and accountability.  My experience differs vastly from their publicity stunt and what is portray in front of media and officials...  And their social media ""comment"" section are always turn off. Self denial of honest feedback?, my kiddo celebrates his 1st month in the school  today and i do have to say the teachers are good and always gives you feedback which benefits us.

COMPARE OUR SON WITH OTHER STUDIES WHICH IS RIDICULOUS. Didnt want to calm the kids when they meltdown instead they IGNORED and let them to calm themselves. First day of school teacher didnt share what will they doing. They really want the kids to be so independent within the time frame. NOT ALL KIDS IS THE SAME. treating the kids like a soldier . make kids to understand really took time,  its not easy.  Principal giving so many scenarios but they dont try to make time for the kids settle themselves. The best is vice principal giving so bad expectations asking whether we are still interested to send my child to school just bcs we send about 930-10am. Ridiculous."

It was definitely a struggle as our girl is very attached to me but with the teachers' efforts, she has grown to love coming to school. From refusing to have her lunch or taking her nap, she now does both with ease! We actually transferred her to a centre that was closer to our home this year but decided to transfer her back to the Kim Keat Centre as there is just such a caring and loving culture here that we could not feel at the new centre. It was definitely worth the trouble and now our girl is loving going to school again!

We will definitely send her future sibling to the same centre too!, Before my daughter started school, she only calls Papa. Two week in, she came home calling Ah ma (grandma), Ah gong (grandpa) and Mama. We are all very impressed.

Highly recommended, Best school with good dedicated Teachers who really care for students from the bottom of their heart"
My First Skool (260 Bukit Batok East Ave 4),"Have transferred my boy from a private cc to this cc as it is more convenient. The teachers have been wonderful with his transition and he has adapted so well in the new environment. He is so well adjusted that he enjoys being in school,  treating it like his own house. Thanks to all teachers for identifying the kids and acknowledging them by their name every morning.  Thumbs up, Been with MFS for many years since my 1st child. Teachers are very caring and attentive to the children. They give us constant feedback of my child's behaviour and patient in answering all our questions.  They also constantly organise alot of activities which is very useful for the kids and my kids enjoyed alot. Most important is my kid likes the teacher., This MFS centre has a dedicated team of teachers. Their commitment to their students under their care is laudable and they also communicate well to us parents., Enrolled my 2yo (playgroup) this year and this may be one of the best decision we have made for the year (: Credits goes to all her teachers (Ms Kavitha, Lulu laoshi, Ms Wahidah and Xu Laoshi) who have been guiding her patiently and showering all the little ones with love..  Teacher Kavitha/Lulu laoshi will always take the effort to summarise and share how was my girl's day in school whenever my mom picks her up (as my mom will always ask ""how is she today"") this is something we really appreciate as we parents will want to know the progress of our child. As i understand from my peers that some other schools/teachers may not do this since it is not ""mandatory"" and they will just ask parents to refer to the daily/monthly update in the app etc. Thus, it makes us even more assured that we chose the right place for our little one.  Last but not least, thank you for handling all the ""daily meltdown"" during the drop off in the morning~ Most importantly, my girl looks forward to go school now!!, My daughter attends the Toddler A class in this branch. They are compassionate and really understanding. Teachers take time to talk and are open to communicate and try new things to help my little one more comfortable. I'm so happy with this branch and would not change it even though it is quite a distance from my place. Thank you teachers for your love for our kids and effort for all lessons., My daughter attended Toodler class. First time going to school for the first week, she is observing everything in school.  She even make new friends with her classmates. Happy to see her enjoying herself in school.  Even she participates in all the activities the teacher's have given her. I also thanks the teacher's for updating weekly photos of her activities involvement.  We as a parents see that our daughter, last time before she enter to school, she talk little only, but after started going to school, she enjoys sing rhythm, a few colours, ABC.  Thank you My First Skool., Made the right choice to switch school for my son who is attending the toddler class as he seems to learn a lot more things that I had imagine. The principal and teachers are v friendly & kind too, giving diligent updates about my son. Makes this worried mother at ease all the time!, This childcare centre by MFS is a hidden gem. My elder boy entered the centre halfway in K1 (in 2019) and the teachers (Luo Laoshi & Teacher Ram) did a great job to assimilate him and encouraged the other children to engage him. For a boy who cried daily at drop off in his previous school, we were prepared that he'll cry again, but to our surprise, he didn't cry at all during this transition and thereafter, enjoyed going to sch daily until he graduated last year.  My younger child now has the same privilege to be cared for by the same team of dedicated teachers (Luo Laoshi, Teacher Ram & Teacher Kavitha).  Curriculum wise, I had my concerns initially like most parents - shd I pay more for better academic focus? That's always the scale that most parents would weigh, but my concerns were allayed as I've come to realize that MFS is a good balance of both affordability and quality. My elder boy enjoyed learning through the various inquiry projects - there would be different themes each term and the teachers put in a lot of effort to pique children's curiosity via hands-on activity, parent engagement,  relation to current affairs and relevance to primary school. The teachers also took many pictures of my child in action and I can easily view the pictures weekly in the parents portal to see what they've learned in school. My boy excelled under this system and is now doing well in primary school with strong foundation set during the 2 yrs of his time in MFS.  Apart from its team of caring and competent teachers, the centre's layout is also a plus point. The classes are split into 3 different bays around blk 258/260, so cases of hfmd, and even covid were kept to a minimal.  Many parents who sent their children to this centre also echo my same view and thus I'd not hesitate to recommend this centre to my family, neighbours and friends., Super good child care. The teachers at playgroup class are awesome. Very professional and patience with children. My child learn a lot of thing like languages, motor skills, etc from this class and he is looking forward to go school everyday. Thumbs up for teacher Jane, teacher Jean and Chen Xia lao shi. Good job and keep it up. Thank you for all ur hard work. Appreciate it., My daughter joined from playgroup to K2 (2019-2023), and is well taken care of by the teachers there., This school is good for my siblings and the teachers are very caring, This My First Skool is very good.

Beautiful Teachers and caregiving staff! Thank you for all your hard work!!! :), Friendly teachers and nice environment to study in., very noisy around, My children have been studying here for more than two years. In these short two years, I have watched my children grow from fear and crying to love and healthy growth now. This transformation is inseparable from teachers. Their professionalism, love and responsibility. I am particularly lucky that I chose my first skool so that my children can feel loved and included in their first school in life., Thank you teachers for teaching my daughter a lot. She can now sing and feed herself. Thank you tobble B‚Äôs teacher, The teachers at MyFirstSkool work very seriously and responsibly, and are very patient with children."

My First Skool (291A Bukit Batok St 24),Very friendly teachers. They go extra mile to support the children and the way they communicate to parents amazed me. Happy to send my child to this center
My First Skool (295A Compassvale Crescent),"Kinda surprised that someone rated my kids school so bad. We found only nice things about this school so far.  We got both of our kids enrolled from toddler class all the way to K1 and PG now. The teachers are very friendly and patient, we can see their genuine passion in dealing with young children,which is the most important thing about the school in our opinion.  Before enrolling them here, we viewed other nearby schools and this is one of the better ones in terms of facility and space availability as well. Maybe if compared with a private centre with double the fee then it won't look as nice but it is more than enough for the kids to play and learn safely.  If there's one thing that can be improved however, is that the reliability and timeliness of communication to parents, as there's no direct communication platform between the teachers and the parents., My son was enrolled into the toddler relation group earlier this year and to date I am very pleased with the center's service.  The curriculum is well structured with both English and Chinese languages, which expose my son into variety of activities that develop all kinds of skills he needs at this age. Particularly he is very excited about the classes related to music and motion which he sometimes even practices after school at home.  The communication with the school and teachers is superb. The APP regularly updates the activities of the kids (with photos) which let the parents have the sense of what the kids are playing at school. Announcement are also timely updated through the APP as well. Further, the center and teachers sent regular emails (e.g., monthly kids update) with more information and suggestions for your kid. What I like most is that the teachers call the parents frequently (2-3 times per week) during kids' nap time to further communicate with the parent verbally, and you also have the chance to talk to teachers when you fetch the kid almost everyday.  Overall I am strongly convinced by the top-notch service provided by the center and do believe my son enjoys the every single day in school., Toddler Nurturing - Teachers are caring and encouraging. They also have engaging activities that helped toddler to becoming more independent. My 18mo girl enjoyed going to school because of all these. Couldn‚Äôt ask for better child-care school üëçüèª ‚Ä¶, Both my sons are in MFS and it has been a wonderful learning experience for the kids. The teachers are approachable and caring. They will take time to update parents during dismissal/arrival. During HBL, the teachers provided many resources and feedback for the kids to learn at home too., The teachers are friendly and they are very encouraging team of teachers. My son was enrolled since 2021 and he enjoy his days with his teachers till now he is in PG. My son's appeitte isnt always good, lbut after much encouragement from them, he is able to finish his lunch by himself. Good effort, tchrs!, Infant - Teachers are friendly, kind and helpful. Thank you to all infant teachers for being patient with my boy, making him enjoy school! Thanks for all your time and love in teaching, it‚Äôs a joy to see our kids loving school and their teachers.

Didnt really check the breakfast veriety.  Cleanliness is the top. Each kids need to clean hand before and after eat, they clean and sanitise mattress  after eat. They mop floor after breakfast and lunch.  Discipline and independence: They also let kid eat by themself but still help to feed at the end which really encourage kid to try!  To ensure quality of air, they open the window and it is windy (there is aircon too but i feel kids shdnt be always in indoor aircon).

My recent teacher encounter, there was a drunk man outside my son‚Äôs class, and I would like to compliment Teacher Leia and Jo Laoshi for being vigilant on that day. They ensure all the kids are by their side and do not release the kids eventhough the parents are there to pick their kids up. They told me to come back later to fetch my son and they are seeking help from the main office. For those parents who are thinking of sending their kids here, it‚Äôs a thumbs up for me, especially academically and safety."

What I like most are warm interactions between staff and children. I can feel that the teachers really love the children and both my kids (k1 and n1) look forward to meeting their teachers every day.  The teachers takes the effort to prepare high quality teaching materials so that the children are able to enjoy their learning. After school, my kids often recount the things that they have been learning.  Most importantly, the school takes great effort to help us participate in the child's learning journey. They provide us with materials which we can use to guide our kids., The teachers are friendly, understanding, and at times, they are willing to go extra miles for my kids. They will always update us on how our kids are doing in school. My younger son have to go for speech therapy as he is slower in speaking. But after I put my younger son in My First Skool Clementi, in just a few months, his language improved. He doesn't even need to go for his speech therapy anymore.

Quality of Teachers I would say, from toddler > playgroup class, all teachers we‚Äôve met, are all top notch teachers.  I love how each day my girl comes back to school and tell me how much fun she had, what she learnt.  Teachers that we had crossed path with are really nice and full of patience, they are also sensitive towards the kids emotions too.  Communication is always 2ways. üëç  2. Learning progression of my child in the centre  I would say, my daughter had improved so much especially in terms of mandarin. We hardly speak mandarin at home, but my girl learnt so much, that she could understand, speak and even sing mandarin songs.  Once again, would like to thank everyone in this centre for keeping our kids safe!, A VERY BIG THANK YOU to all center teachers in particular, teachers for K2 Classes.

My First Skool (438 Bukit Batok West),
My First Skool (443A Fajar Road),"Often, hear teachers from 443D and 443C scolding the kids loudly. Especially 1 Indian teacher. Saw the Indian teacher, scolding the kids loudly a few times. 1 time, I saw her scolding a 3 year old boy so loudly until it could be heard like 5 to 7 meters away(really loud). She called the boy to stand in front of her, and she shouted right at the small boy. The boy was quiet and seen nodding his head softly. Is this how you deal with kids? Are you being trained to treat kids that way? So unacceptable, very¬≤ rude. If you have no patience, then you are not fit to be a pre-school teacher. You don't treat kids that way. Even to a grown-up kid, we don't embarrass people that way.  A Chinese teacher who was there with the Indian teacher was just watching and didn't do anything to stop the Indian teacher. When a few passersby stood outside the class to see them, only then the Chinese teacher signaled the Indian teacher to stop and to look out the window at us. She stopped scolding the boy after realizing people were watching her."

The management style of the principal has been very good, dealing well with parents and kids and also providing a good environment for the teachers to work in, so I have utmost faith that the teachers will in turn treat the children well. The school itself is small, there is one class per level, and everyone knows everyone, which is genuinely nice for a change. Food is cooked onsite and is healthy and well balanced for the kids to eat (it's healthier than the food I can manage to feed my own children at home!), activities are well thought out for the children's levels.

My First Skool (51 Fernvale Link),"My daughter has been going to this school since she was around 3 months old. The ifc teachers are awesome and really care for the babies! I love how they have daily outdoor walks and how they are exposed to nature instead of always being kept in the classrooms.  She's now in PG and the same applies for the teachers too. Teachers share with us any new milestones like when she talked much more than usual and also cares for her safety and well being. She's also very happy in class and loves to read books, sing and dance to songs that she learnt in school.  All the teachers at this centre are really awesome and passionate, they all deserve a pay raise! Even though we are moving house, we are still going to send her here because I really like how dedicated all the leaders and teachers are. Thank you!!, A school with passionate teachers and centre leaders. My daughter enjoys going to school everyday. Being less than 2 years old, she could even share with me her teacher's names and sings song taught by them back at home. Im so surprised when I saw her dancing and singing along to music and even reading a book like 'Brown Bear' on her own. The teachers often checks on the well-being of my daughter and shares with me loads of photos of my daughter's learning in school. Both my husband and myself feels at ease ever since my daughter was enrolled into the school since she was a infant. Great school, definitely would recommend anyone looking for one :), Soon, my girl will be promoted to N1  We are blessed that she is attending this school. So that she can meet all her wonderful friends and all the dedicated staff from the school! They are all so friendly and warm!  It's been 6 months since my girl was in this school. I can see my girl has tremendous changes towards school. In the beginning she whined and cried because of the change in environment, but very quickly she is happy to go school.  A very BIG thank you to all the staff, passionate teachers & principal! We are very happy :)  Special thanks to her class teachers! Teacher Annie & Zhang Laoshi. Both of them have been giving great care and guidance to my girl. She always surprised us with what she learned at school. Singing all sorts of English and Chinese songs. Even dancing!

Truly not an easy feat, but it is definitely rewarding!, Big Shout-out to the Amazing My First Skool Crew! üåü  First off, major kudos to the principal, Ms Gillian - always there to listen and address concerns made our experience truly exceptional.  The screening teachers (teacher Faa, Priya & Cheng) are always so patient and smiley, even with the crying kiddos.  Our son's English and Chinese teachers (Teacher Jed & Zhou laoshi) are like gems and deserve a superhero cape - super patient, caring, and passionate about their job. Taking care of so many kids sounds like a tough gig, but they handle it like pros (I observed during 1st day orientation & field trip)! Our son was new to the school and we constantly witnessed the teachers went the extra miles to make him settle in, the dedication and thoughtfulness really touch our hearts! ‚ú®  And a big shout-out to the new teachers (Teacher Kriz & Lili laoshi) - so kind when our little one leveled up to a new class and environment. Constantly providing updates and assurance really help make us feel confident about the changes.

Safety and assurance are of paramount importance when it comes to choosing a preschool for our children.  Teachers are impressively responsible as they go beyond the call of duty by ensuring the kids' well- being are taken care of with the messages sent to us to check out our kids after school hours., My son has only attended playgroup for 1.5 months but I‚Äôm very happy that I chose to give up my previous school option and switched him over before he turned 18mo. The educators here provide daily updates when we do pick ups and even through emails and on the app to help parents like us be assured that our child is settling well into school.  The educators have also been putting in a lot of effort in planning events and celebrations in school which I appreciate a lot because taking care of such huge bunch of kids is already no easy feat yet they do all the extra work with a smile all the time.  When my child fell sick his teachers check in on him through calls or emails and I am deeply appreciative of their concern for his well-being. Overall, I‚Äôm very thankful and glad I found a school I can trust to place my child in good hands.

I'd like to thank all the teachers for their love and care to my kids! Especially, thank you Xue Laoshi and Teacher Renee!, The school has caring teachers but the walkway is too small for people to pass through and also, not many parents have the brains to understand that the walkway is too small.  i.e.  1) Bringing themselves together with 1 helper and blocking the walkway as though they own it.  2) Strollers are blocking the way as though the parent/guardian own it.  3) Check-ins sometimes are too slow due to some inconsiderate housewives who are taking their own sweet time. Sorry but no sorry, please be smarter and considerate that there are WORKING PARENTS who are rushing for time. Do not take your own sweet time to check in and block the queue., My child has been in this school since her infant days. The teachers are great and care so much for these little ones. My child looks forward to school and she learns so much here. Thank you teachers, especially Teacher Aliyah, Mu Laoshi, Teacher Renee and Xue Laoshi!, My son used to go to another pre-school and had a hard time adjusting and was crying everyday at school.

My First Skool (571 Ang Mo Kio Ave 3),Shout out to My First Skool at Blk 571 Ang Mo Kio.  Two of my children have been there since they were 18 Months old.  We appreciate all their hard work and patience with our children. It is clear they care for all the children and are patient with them.  The teachers at all levels have big hearts and as a parent I feel bad that my children are not the easiest to deal with at time.  Thank you to the principal and all the teaching and non-teaching staff at AMK BlK 571 MFS.
My First Skool (6 Segar Road),"The staff are always warm and cheerful, ready to greet the children and pace their day. The educators are also mindful of each individual child's needs and do their best to cater to them in a nurturing manner that promotes curiosity and development of social skills from a young age. Personally, our daughter loves going to school and enjoys her time with her teachers through the 2 years she has been here. Communication with the staff has always been pleasant, and the teachers provide timely feedback and input about how our girl has been doing in school and all her little antics. We appreciate this and the relationships they have created with and for our little girl, and I am sure it would come a long way in her growth and learning., As working parents to an infant, it is always a difficult and complex decision to make when it comes to alternative care.  What assured us to decide on MFS @ 6 Segar Rd was their unique infrastructure and multiple programmes with community partners, simulating a homely yet sociable environment at an affordable price. The team has also been welcoming and approachable, impressing us with their knowledge in childcare as well as their emphasis to family involvement in the upbringing of a child.  We are thankful and grateful that such a service is available and within the vicinity of our neighbourhood.

They come back everyday telling us how much they enjoy and want to go to school even in their sick days!, Real good place to have younger kids to learn and play.

And to see the smiles and giggles from the children‚Äôs face to return their greeting, is priceless.  My firstborn has graduated from that centre 3 years ago but they continue to ask about his wellbeing.  I also love how patient and accommodating the teachers are in this centre. They will continue to engage and provide constructive feedback to parents to create a positive atmosphere for the children in school.  The center is also conducive for kids to learn and grow!

Each of them played a critical role in helping our children to adjust, adapt and enjoy their preschool experiences. It is highly commendable as the staffs will consistently make conscientious effort to identify and memorise the name of every child at the centre. Activities and celebrations are also frequently held for the children to help  them to understand the origins of each festivals and foster a senses of what they should value in their lives. The publications of the activities album are helpful for parents to know and understand the learning phase of their children as well.  The location, standalone building as well as the comprehensive range of facilities available have also enabled the children to learn, play and grow uninterrupted.  Hope to see the organising of external excursions (e.g. to the farms, etc) for the children/and parents to mingle and share their experiences of parenting. A forum/portal for the parents to interact with one another will be beneficial for the growth of the children as well. As parents, we look forward to know more about how our children progress and behave in school so that we can play a better part in guiding them as well., So fortunate to have enrolled my son here since infant care.

The school's engaging curriculum and supportive staff make it the perfect place for children to grow and explore. Highly recommend! üåü ‚Ä¶, Strongly recommend this centre, it has a lot of programmes that are beyond the curriculum and the staff have the spirit of excellence in ensuring quality. The centre has a strong leadership and they make it a point to engage us parents well to make sure we know what is going on in school., The worst. After 2 months they seem to want to give up dealing with a kid. One of the worst pre schools i have seen in awhile."
My First Skool (637 Pasir Ris Dr 1),"Very good pre-school: Principal and teachers are very good, friendly and loves the kids. The bilingual syllabus is healthy and they learn a lot through appropriate play, art, songs & story telling. Food is cooked in-house and healthy with good variety. Kiddo likes his teachers and classmates. He is also more independent and disciplined, Best staff you can expect. You can trust your precious gem with the caring staff.

My First Skool (654 Senja Road),"Initially, I have lots of reservation about the school. Whether if my kid will be well taken care of and if the Teachers and staffs are capable.  However, my concerns were uncalled for. The Teachers and even the cleaner aunties are always on a constant look out for all the kids. Treating each like their own.  The teachers also do make it a point to share with parents on any interesting encounters with our kids.  Hope the school continue to stay this way and always delivering excellence in raising our next generation., Both of my kids attended Myfirstskool and I am very pleased with the principal and the teachers. When my kids just started preschool, they often cry when they reached the school. Fortunately, Teacher Geetha and Mdm Liu were extremely patient with my boy and taught him well. They only took a short while and my boy was able to adapt to the new environment. Teacher Sue has also built a relatively good foundation for my kid‚Äôs English language despite language can be a challenge especially for such young children.  My girl also enjoys going to school. And I felt Teacher Rabia and Mdm Liu were very good with kids and made lessons very fun and interesting for my girl.  Teacher Wai Meng and Teacher Xiao has put in great effort for the class and involved much hands-on for the children. The kids can experience many types of stuff such as cooking, baking, planting and painting. The principal, Ms Amanda, is very prompt and responsive whenever I have enquiries. Overall, I felt the teachers were gentle and patient. They teach the children how to control their emotions well and learning to be independent. Children are able to grow and learn in many innovative ways as they are exposed to various activities which allow them to dream big.

I am very glad that I choose My First Skool senja centre for my kids . It is probably one of the best decision my wife and I have made.  Thank you Teachers! And The wonderful Aunties!, The teachers in My First Skool at Blk 654 Senja Road are very nurturing teachers. I like how they update me about how my child is adapting to the environment in school. I have 2 children in this centre. My first born is able to adapt to the school very fast and she did not have any problems interacting with the teachers there. She has been in this school from toddler (2020) until now, she is in Nursery (2022). My second born is in toddler now and he has a hard time adjusting to the school initially as he wasn't able to part ways with my husband when he send him to school. The teachers in his centre calm him down. And he was able to stay calm and continued playing in the centre.

Shout-out to non-teaching staff as well for their time taking care of the centre at B654 Senja Road!, Daughter enjoyed herself when going to school daily. The teacher in charge are very friendly, helpful and attentive to the kids.  More often than not, teachers are well aware of the being of the individual child and will share details of the child development and well being in the school., MFS Senja Centre teachers and staff are awesome! My two children grown up from Infant all the way to K2 (my younger daughter is in K2 now). I always joked with the teachers that my children like school so much that they are always not in hurry to go home. Teachers and staff are caring and attentive to children's overall well-being. Environment is clean, tidy and comfortable. I am assured that my children are very well taken care of by a great team! - A satisfied mum with two happy children graduated (graduating) from MFS SJC üëçüèª, It was our first time enrolling our sons in infant/preschool so we were nervous at first but the teachers and the rest of the staff at MFS Senja are so incredible that they soon made us feel comfortable.

My First Skool (656C Jurong West St 61),"My daughter has been with MyFirst skool JW6 since infant care till K2. I have very amazing journey with the teachers and the principal. The teachers are well trained and follow up with the developmental, learning and well being of my daughter. Principal Ms May has been the most amazing principal all these years.

Thank you JW6 teachers especially K2 Liu Laoshi, teacher Wanyi and Ms May for the guidance and love u gave to my daughter., My child had been with My First Skool since her infant care days till K2 graduation. She enjoyed going to school to learn and play with her friends. There was regular feedback from teachers if there were any concerns raised.

Big thank you to the principal and teachers at this centre for their dedication, care and concern for my child!, Great teachers, principal, environment and curriculum! My child enjoyed her 6 years of education there from infant care till K2. She is well prepared for primary 1 and has made many good friends from My First Skool JW6!, School teachers were excellent.

Great work team JWC06, There were a few places which I surveyed before I enrolled my daughter to MyFirstSkool and it was a decision which I have not regretted till today. They have provided an excellent learning programme which has suited for her since day 1. She has shown a good development in terms of academic which surpass her age. The teachers and principal are friendly and open to discussion. During this COVID period, the staff has shown to take extra initiative to keep the parents updated and keeping the center operational as much as possible as per accordance to the  regulatory guidelines.

Principal, Ms May Teo, has been very responsive to all my queries especially during covid period when there were disruptions to classes. When covid hindered outdoor play for the kids, the teachers replaced with fun activities to engage the children, this showed how committed and passionate the teachers are. Overall, my experience with this branch has been pleasant. My daughter likes all her teachers from infant to now nursery, she is progressing steady and always a happy girl in school. Keep up the good job, JW6!, I enrolled my daughters since 2019, and we all love it here. Principal is very nice & kind, always checks up on parents and children. Teachers are amazing. As parents, we are also soo attached to the teachers. Curriculum is great. Food wise, my picky daughters has no complains! They have been there since toddlers and my eldest is in K1 now. I just enrolled my baby for their infant care too recently. Overall, this is the best centre for my kids. No regrets., What I love about this centre is that my son gets to have an authentic experience through the integrated curriculum that they have, ensuring children also learn about the things around them. The teachers are meticulous and are always ready to share about my child's development and give suggestions to how I can help better his skills. Teachers also take the time to do up the classroom with themes relating to the children's interest out of their work hours. In addition, the principal makes a point to keep up with current issues and provide transparency to allow parents to make informed decision (especially during the pandemic)., My son attended My First Skool (JWC06) since he was 4 months old and now, he is in Nursery. Throughout his education at the centre, he had amazing teachers. The Principal and all the teachers are very warm, approachable, enthusiastic and caring in their interactions with the children and parents.  They are always updating me about my son during send off and pick up, updates in the communication book, child's portfolio, parents portal and meet the parents sessions are some of the useful communication channels  that I find useful to get insights in his progress in school.  The teachers make observations and document them to keep track of the children‚Äôs development and ensure that they reach their milestones. The teachers supported, encouraged and helped in other aspects such as doing daily routines independently, eating their fruits and veges and even potty training. The teachers, at every level built great relationships with him. This makes him feel safe in school and in turn, enjoys going to school. The centre teachers take a lot of time and effort to make the classroom a conducive and playful atmosphere for the children based on the the different learning themes throughout the year. This sets an engaging atmosphere for them to play and learn. My son always talks about the different themes at the Dramatic Corner and Learning Centres that the teachers prepared. The centre encourage learning and bonding time at home with the take home activities that are based on the learning themes. The classrooms are clean and neat.  Baskets with learning tools and toys are organised neatly in shelves so that the children can easily pick them based on their interest. The centre has a well rounded curriculum.  Some of the lessons that my son enjoys are music and movement, story telling,  phonics, gross and fine motor activities and outdoor walks in the neighbourhood. His learning experiences in the centre helped and encouraged him to be a curious learner and confident little boy!, I have enrolled both my children in this branch since 2020. At first I was skeptical about choosing MFS due to hearing some feedbacks, but I am glad to have chosen this school. It has met my expectations thus far. Both my children have food allergies, the school has made arrangements and has dealed with the situation well. I love how the teachers and principal are interactive and constantly on the lookout for the kids. We can definitely tell how much kids enjoyed the school by their interaction with the teachers, principals and school aunties. There are also alot of activities for the children. They do have after school programmes like abacus which i think is a great addition to the curriculum. Apart from fun activities, they do have academic progression which i do think is also important. Overall, i would definitely recommend this MFS branch., It's a trustworthy pre-school, very good teachers and management team, with good curriculum.  My son enrolled from 4 months old, and now we already with this center more than 1.5 years. I appreciate all teachers raise and educate my son with patience. He loves teachers over there and very happy to see he growth and learn something new everyday.  Although they do not have fancy ""app"" for parents to chat with teachers or school, however, all information shared timely to parents by call or daily communication during drop-off and pick up. Teachers will pay attention on the kids instead their phone, I think this is the utmost important that you do not wish teachers to check the phone all day.  Also, this school is pay seriously attention on hygiene, this is really important during COVID period. They follow the highest standard, deep clean every time when a COVID case reported. Therefore, even thought during pandemic period, there's no pandemic in this center.  This school may not have a fancy looks, but I think the most important is teachers, curriculum and principle how they manage the school ensure kids growth happily. Also, to find a team who you can trust, especially for double income family who without support from grandparents is really important.  I highly recommend and will make my son continue with this pre-school., My child always look forward to go to school everyday. She love her friends and teachers. Teachers are approachable and friendly. They are really concern on the students studies and also the school provided extra lessons for the students who are weak in their studies. Really love the school and appreciate the hardworks of all the staffs, especially Principal May.., The principal and all the Teachers are very responsible. They are very professional and they are really caring all the children. The curriculum is very helpful for my children‚Äôs study. My children not only leant the knowledge at school but also the good habits. Really recommendüëç ‚Ä¶, My First Skool Jurong West St 61 is a great childcare for kids. My son enjoys the lessons conducted by the teachers and Lao Shi. Highly recommended., Both my kids are attending at this centre. They learn a lot at school improving their language skill., Child care and kindergarden going children Centre. 2 different styles type of uniforms?

All the teachers at this childcare are not only passionate about what they do but also excellent at communicating with parents.  I was particularly impressed by the recent Children's Day carnival they organized. It was so much fun, and it was evident that both the teachers and the principal had put in their best efforts to make it a memorable experience for the children. They absolutely enjoyed it!  Thank you, Ms. Liza, and all the teachers(Teacher Alicia, Teacher Christine, Âº†ËÄÅÂ∏àÔºåÂê¥ËÄÅÂ∏àÔºåÂêïËÄÅÂ∏àÔºåTeacher Angel, and many many more other teachers) at Hougang 4 for creating a nurturing and enriching environment for our kids.

Gossipy Teachers, scolding young toddlers daily, not giving breakfast even 5mins before 8.30am, brain wash kids that their own fault to fall and bleed. Dirty drawers with ants crawling and turtle inside dark dirty water not changed. Rude and nasty Teachers not caring for kids. Kids will go home with dirty finger nails. Their recycling teachings are simply crushing newspaper..  Am so glad that I withdrew and place my child in another preschool which is so much better than mfs 742!, My child absolutely loves the experiences in and out of the classroom. The teachers put in a lot of effort into their learning and updating us when needed. Two thumbs up!"

My First Skool (950 Hougang St 91),
My First Skool (997 Buangkok Crescent),"The curriculum follows the MFS standard, which is in itself a suitable and good curriculum. This branch is also big, in that it spans a number of void decks, allowing for more children to be taken in. There are no enrichment activities worth talking about, which is understandable for a non-private operator. The teachers, however, leave much to be desired. They seem tired, uninterested in the children, and do not interact or handle the children with love. I understand this paints a broad stroke, so more specifically the criticism is directed to some staff at the 18-month children mark. Sincerely hope the leadership will be able to nip this at the bud sooner rather than later."

My First Skool at Blk 153 Rivervale Crescent,"School teachers are very patient and caring towards my kids. I have noticed my kids have improve their reading and social skills which I believe the teachers does help and assist them during this school journey. Also, the principal and teachers always keep me updated of the activity happen in school which is a good way of communication., Principles and teachers are patient and flexible. Together with the aunties, they provide a safe, clean and caring environment.  There are many interesting topics shared in class, activities were fun and educational. Other than the normal academic curriculum, children were also introduced to world art, culture and current news. Parents are able to view the activates photos through the MFS Parent app.  You know it is the right place when you see your child is excited about going to Skool everyday. Thank you for all the love to QT., As a working mum, it can get difficult at times to juggle the load between work commitments and child care. Enrolling both my children in MFS-RVC has been one of the best choices we have made.  It was an intimidating and teary moment to place my firstborn in infant care from the young age of 4 months. With Chen Laoshi's kind reassurance and over time, seeing him thrive in school has put my heart at ease and the decision to also place my 2nd child in infant care was an easy one to make. The teachers at Infant care, Chen Laoshi, Teacher Heeda, Teacher Jenny, treat the children as if their own. It's a joy to see the teachers are always in high spirits, enthusiastically welcoming the children during drop off. When my younger child was unwell and hadn't been to school, Teacher Heeda makes the effort to constantly follow up on her well being even after working hours. This is a testament to how much genuine care the teachers have for the little ones. In terms of curriculum, infants explore activities through sensory play that enhances their listening, language and psychomotor skills. Most of the teaching materials are very creative and often hand made by the teachers themselves through recycled materials. Besides sensory play, teachers also help guide the little ones through tummy time, learning to sit, crawl and walk. They also encourage infants to self-feed, put on shoes, wash hands etc at the age-appropriate juncture. My young one is currently doing very well in the care of these experienced, qualified and most importantly, loving teachers.  Toddlerhood was a tough phase for my elder son who was having difficulty coping with his big emotions. I am grateful to Teacher Joyce for going the extra mile, to sit with him every evening before pick up to walk him through and sort out these feelings. The teacher-child bond is so strong, my child would even mistakenly call me Teacher Joyce at times! He would also always say he misses her. Dealing with a threenager is difficult. Dealing with a whole class of them calls for utmost patience and dedication, kudos to Teacher Joyce and Liu Laoshi!  It was a drastic change for my elder son to graduate from PG to Nursery this year. Here, independence is strongly encouraged in preparation for Primary school. Children will learn to go to the toilet, clean up after themselves and learn to communicate their wants and needs. They do well in fostering the children's curiosity and also build up my son's confidence for public speaking through ""Show and Tell"". Many thanks to Teacher Joycelyn and Lei Laoshi for the well structured, creative and enjoyable lessons. My elder child especially loves the lesson on the 3R's and also listening walk, and would request to do the same at home. Through their patient guidance, we can see improvement in our child's speech and confidence. Beyond the day to day classroom curriculum, the centre also offers optional age-appropriate music/ abacus/ science etc enrichment lessons in the evening. This is helpful for parents with time constraints for weekend enrichment classes.  MFS-RVC is not just a school, in a way, it's like an extended family. The Principal and teachers are extremely supportive, always willing to share good advice when needed. When we were having a hard time deciding the next path for our child, Ms Angela generously spent an hour out of her busy schedule to speak to us, providing us with her unbiased, useful advice.  Our children spend most of their time in school and finding them the right one is paramount. I would like to thank Ms Angela and especially her wonderful, passionate team of teachers who have helped nurture and paved the foundation for my children to flourish in their crucial early years and beyond!, My child just turned 18 months last year. We made the decision to get him started in Playgroup even though we were concerned about health and safety. Our experience with My First Skool @ Rivervale Crescent  since my son started far exceeded our expectations. They constantly provided assurance of our child's safety and wellbeing. We have seen major improvement in his speech and learning. Most importantly, my child loves going to school every day. Thank you!, The teachers in centre have always been dedicated and committed in their work, and they show geninue interest in the well-being of my two boys who are enrolled in the centre.  I appreciate the teachers from infantcare Chen Lao Shi, to teachers for the younger age group like Teacher Joyce and Ke Lao Shi. My elder son has progressed tremendously under Lead Teachers Joycelyn and Liu Lao Shi last year. This year, Teacher Wanie and Teacher Megan together with Liu Lao Shi are continuing the good work.  I am thankful that the teachers have tirelessly taught both my boys many essential life skills so they can be independent eg self-feeding, wearing shoes, changing clothes and potty training.  The teachers are also maintain close communication with us parents through the parents' portal, keeping us updated on our children's learning progress and development., My two boys both study here .

Now my youngest one is going to graduate from k2, he said he will kiss the teacher , school and classmate so much . I can‚Äôt express more , just want to say thank you to all the Teachers , aunties and school principles ., Our son has been with MFS-RVD since he was 8 months old, currently he is in the playgroup class loving every moment of it. We are extremely glad that we made the decision to place our child in MFS‚Äôs care, we can see huge progress in his development as he is learning and experiencing different things in MFS. This is all thanks to the teachers and staff of the MFS-RVD which spent time and effort curating different programs to suit the children‚Äôs needs. We are also provided with regular feedback on his development and behaviour in class. Photos of events and activities are uploaded on the MFS Parent app for us to catch a glimpse of what his day is like in school. Accidents and incidents are bound to happen when we have a group of rowdy toddlers, however the teachers and staff are making huge effort to keep them to the minimum, when things happened we are notified immediately, this is much appreciated. We know that our son is in good hands when we drop him off at school when we go to work. Special mention to Chen & Yun Laoshi & Teacher Heeda & Mas (Infant); Ke Laoshi, Teacher Sharmine and Tan (Toddler); Teacher Sharmine and Liu Laoshi (Playgroup); Principal Angela and the Aunties who helped cook and clean for the children., Both my sons are from MFS 153 Rivervale Crescent, and my elder son Royce was fortunate to have Teacher Joyce as his English teacher for almost every year! She was his favorite teacher of all time and he really enjoyed every moment in school. Even though he is in P2 now, he still missed those days when Teacher Joyce and Liu Laoshi were his teachers.  My younger son Ryo is also in good hands of Liu Laoshi and Teacher Wanie. Truly appreciate their dedication in early childhood and always taking very good care of my son!, Kudos to teachers & principals of MFS 153 RVC! Teachers are caring and maintain good communications with parents. Activities to engage parents in children's journey are well-thought out. My daughter (Nursery'22) is now more articulate in expressing her emotions and has pretty good vocabulary in describing things around us. She clearly enjoys school!

The school environment is also safe and clean enough to let children play around., Both my sons are from MFS RVC 153. Appreciate the Teachers‚Äô effort in taking care and teaching my sons. The elder one who is in K1 now, he could barely speak Chinese during his playgroup and nursery days, but he has shown us so much improvement now. Thank you Liu Laoshi for guiding him this far! I would also like to thank Teacher Sharmaine for her dedication in her work as both of my sons were taught by her since playground. Both of them were in good hands and I had nothing to worry.  - Kaleb & Kayden‚Äôs Mummy, im actually very satisfied with the teacher and the school as my son is a bit hard to handle when it comes to a new environment i remembered when he first went to school he was always crying and very hard to stop also . but the teacher never give up on him and spend time in helping him to adapt to everything. The teachers will also give me advise on how to help him or what i should do in his process of growing up . even though this is my second child but its the first time im actually taking care of one without any help and the teacher's advises came in time like a helping for me in his upgrowing . they also will update me on everything that has happen in school when i go fetch him and all . im glad my son eventually likes to go to school a lot he will wake up very early and be excited when i tell him that its time for him to go school . he is learning a lot also especially when i have to work a lot but the teachers will help him in talking , in walking and also some hands on also as it was in the portal for parents on the child's activities and all . im able to work in peace knowing that my child is in good hands :) thank you so much for all the time and kindness taken in helping my child to grow i really am grateful for all the help :), My both the kids started with my 1st Skool.

My First Skool at Blk 161 Jalan Teck Whye (New Centre Opening Soon),"If you are enrolling your child to PG, ensure your child is able to walk independently. My child was not able to do so and needed some guidance by just holding one hand to walk. As a result on day 1 of orientation, I was strongly advised/forced by the teachers to withdraw and back to waiting list .  Principal backed up the teachers citing safety and the child ( who just turned 18 months) has to be independent enough to carry out daily activities .  Day 2 orientation, I had to make the hard decision to withdraw because the teachers seem to ignore my child because of his inability to walk independently.  After withdrawing , I went to other playgroups (not MFS) to enquire even asking if walking independently is a requirement . All mentioned it is not as it can be gradually learnt while in the PG. In the end managed to enrol my child to another PG who has the patience to take care and guide my child.  Conclusion : Please for the sake of your child ,  consider carefully first before enrolling . I would like to highlight other MFS branches do not have these funny requirements .  Thank you for reading"

When we first came in, the principal Mrs Fong was always around to provide frequent updates on how my child had been settling in the new environment and that definitely made me feel less anxious as a first-time parent. Her class teachers in PG and N1 have been such wonderful gems - Tung Laoshi, Teacher Wani and Li Laoshi - they built such genuine relationships with the children under their care and you can rest assured that your child is in good hands with them as your child‚Äôs class teachers!

They don't hesitate to go the extra mile to ensure that parents have peace of mind when entrusting their children to the school. The small teacher-student ratio also ensures that the children get the attention and guidance they need at this very young age. It is really satisfying to see my child blossom under their care. I will not hesitate to recommend this to other parents!, This preschool is nested between the terrace houses along Jalan Singa. I like the school not only because of the small teacher to child ratio, they also have a little garden that they teach students to grow plants and vegetables, a little playground for the children to have outdoor time. School teachers are warm and it's like a family where everyone knows everyone., Sweet teachers and good environment.. My child has developed her education skill (writing, reading etc) and she got the chance to explore on what she likes ie: drawing, arts etc..She was able to mingle with other kids from other classes.. means the environment made her possible to interact with others, so that she will know how to adapt with her surroundings .. the communication between school (principal & teachers) & parents are smooth.., Everyday, my child goes home with awesome stories from My Kiddie Klubhouse. He has developed values which what we really need now and in the future."

These values rank high in my priorities when selecting a preschool.  The teachers at My Little Gem are not only approachable but also maintain clear and effective communication with parents. They pay meticulous attention to the minor details of my child's well-being and promptly update us of any unusual occurrences. Their boundless energy and capacity to embrace students with care are truly commendable!  Moreover, the school regularly hosts talks by special guests, enriching the lives of our little ones. The opportunity for the students to practice Dana (giving) with Venerable and engage in enlightening stories add a rewarding dimension to their experiences.

The academic teaching is also strong as my kids have no issues adapting to Primary 1 work.  What is even more precious is that My Little Gems plants the seeds of kindness and mindfulness in the preschoolers. These values will greatly aid the child., My 3 girls attended My Little Gems, 2 have graduated and one is still studying. Love that the school practice mindfulness with them from young. The practice helps the girls to be aware of the thoughts and check-in to their emotions. Besides, the school organises regular events to share the joy and show kindness to the elderly. We are grateful to the teachers and staff in the school. Thank you., We are very blessed to have found My Little Gems Preschool for our children. The teachers are truly dedicated, consistently passionate and genuine in collaborating with parents in the upbringing of the children.  Gratitude towards parents, respect for teachers and elderly, kindness and generosity towards friends are everyday emphasis in the centre.  Frequent and prompt updates are well informed and communicated to the parents on their child learning and social development. We also appreciate that teachers did not hesitate to be honest when our child needed improvement in certain areas. On the other hand, the school takes constructive feedbacks seriously, over the years we've witnessed improvement in many areas such as academic teaching materials, well being activities, enrichment lessons, field trips and the year end concerts.  It had been a great holistically rich experience for our little gems throughout their preschool years. Even when they were enrolled in full day session, it seemed time passed too soon for the little ones and never had enough of it.  Overall, we are very thankful that our children are in good hands while we carry out our daily duties. Over the years we have recommended many friends and also received many similar compliments for the school., My eldest 2 girls attended My Little Gems Preschool. They love it and enjoy their time spent there with their teachers and friends. Although they are now in Primary 6 & Primary 4, they miss their teachers, staffs and friends there and often proudly show their other sibling My Little Gems Preschool whenever they pass by it. The teachers have been guiding and encouraging them well throughout their studies and activities. We wish all of them love and peace, which the children are taught at MLG to thank their elders., My girl was two when she joined the PG class at My Little Gems Preschool. Within a span of less than 6 months, we are amazed by how much she has grown. From the initial crying, refusal to wear uniform and going to school. Now after school each day when asked how‚Äôs school today? The reply we get, ‚ÄúIt was fun!‚Äù  Much thanks to Teacher Annabel, Hu Lao Shi, Teacher Sebrine, Teacher Winnie, Teacher Cynthia and rest of the Teachers who have been showering her with lots of love, patience and encouragement. No doubt the initial transition was tough, Teacher Annabel speaks to us frequently to understand how my girl was coping, finding out about her developments back hm since starting school and sharing her observations of my girl‚Äôs development in school. Teacher Annabel also shares with us useful tips and ways on how we could engage my girl and prepare her for school. We like the way how the teachers engage and work with parents. It give us great assurance of how supportive and committed the teachers and school are to ensure that my girl are coping well in school and back home.  During the morning drop off, we also notice how each teacher regardless from which class would warmly address my girl by her name which we feel is a thoughtful gesture to make her feel welcome when received by any of the teachers.  In terms of the school curriculum wise, other than the academic teachings, there are also emphasis placed on character building which incorporates Buddhism such as mindfulness which are of equal importance as academic teachings.  We look forward to continue working with the teachers and staff of My Little Gems Preschool for my girl to achieve more milestones!, My girl has been attending MLG for a year plus and I can really see how she shine and grow. Initially I was quite worried that she will take a while to adapt herself to the school but it was quite a breeze for her. I love how the teachers would give positive energy and encouragement to the children. From a shy and soft spoken girl to a confident little girl is how the school has shaped her to be. The constant updating of curriculums and photos by the teachers enable me to see her progress too! Thank you to all the teachers and principal of MLG!, We have been attending this school for 5 months now. I like it that school teaches very proper and cornerstone life values - respect to elderly, support to each other, compassion, kindness...the list goes on. Their principal and teachers are very dedicated and engaged and in constant lookout how to improve the program.  I was hugely impressed by their year end concert, the level of preparedness, Buddhist (and again, just basic key values) ideas put behind in a creative way, the level of dance (by the way! not a common thing in Singapore to have a well and quite sophisticated dance for the childcare kids). I think the key that I like is - dedication, love to kids, well thought program, and those right values which I mentioned above. In the current materialistic world we live in, these are very precious. Many things I am still perhaps early to judge, but so far I am very happy with the school (and grateful).  On a side note, my son is carrying a hand made bookmark in his school bag, which says 'honesty'., Thank you to the Teachers of MLG! You all are patient and caring, both my children love coming to school daily. The curriculum is not just about academics, but also about the children‚Äôs character, which to me are important values for my children in the long run., My Little Gem Pre school focuses on Character development. My child have developed responsibilities and contribution at home and in the public such as pushing in chair before leaving. Such a simple action it shows great social responsibility. Education is not just about excelling in intellectual knowledge but also equally important in developing positive character!, 3 of our children pre-schooled at My Little Gems (MLG).  2 have graduated, while our youngest boy is in N1.  Our kids love MLG, especially the teachers.  They will never want to skip school.  We like the holistic education that MLG provides, both in terms of bilingual education, as well as in character development.  Extremely proud that our girl was the emcee for MLG‚Äôs 2022 graduation performance, and she spoke eloquently and performed with confidence on stage.  Happy to recommend MLG to every parent!, Have started Colin since 2019 till now, I must say MLG have never failed to amaze me.  Ben‚Äôs team have really dedicated not just time but really passion to impart knowledge, values and also wisdom to our child and also to us as parents. The curriculum have always been so fun and exciting, Colin is always looking forward to go to school and it didn‚Äôt end there he will continue to share with us how and what he have learn in school at home especially current affairs and experiments. The environment MLG have provided and created not just allow the kids to learn morals and values in class but also implement on day to day life.  I‚Äôm very grateful we have chosen MLG to be the first school to build a strong foundation for our child., MLG provides Preschool programme unlike other typical Preschool. Their program gives our twins a head start into primary school curriculum. Now my twins is in Primary One picking up higher chinese really well. As a Buddhist Preschool, values, morales and virtues are taught to the students and in a fun way. This is their most unique and special difference as compared to most other preschool or primary school. Thank you all the teachers and principle for your patients and effort in educating our children., Well done MLG! Always an excellent finale to the year for the students in the school with your outstanding high quality performances completely helmed by the students., Thank you My Little Gems for bringing out the best in our 3 little gems. My children have fond memories of their preschool days at MLG. I asked them what they missed most from preschool and my eldest says he missed the gross motor sessions where they could do fun outdoor activities safely within the temple compound, the youngest one loved the food and says she missed eating the yummy vegetarian curry which is not spicy at all. My 2nd boy‚Äôs love for nature blossomed, he still has a keen interest in all things about animals and plants, which started when he was in K1. He remembers Teacher Ye Qin taught them about these topics, and also had the opportunity to experience nature up close when they did their little exploratory visits to the open space behind the school compound, and tended to their little garden space at the ground level. üå±, Travelled 18km every morning to send my children to My Little Gems Preschool, because I can't find a better one for my children to grow up in! üëçüèª  I remembered when I first visited the school in 2018, I was impressed at how focused the young children were. All thanks to the daily mindfulness practices, I could also proudly say that after 5 years in My Little Gems, my child also has good focus and is able to listen and follow instructions well.  In this school, not only was my child well prepared for primary school, she also grew into a child with empathy, kindness, gratitude and lots of love. The dynamic curriculum you find here is unique. Not only did my child learn to be independent and responsible through the character building classes and day to day interactions, she also learnt to be kind and spread love through visiting elderly care centre and voluntary work.  What was more impressive was how the school brought the world to my child by conducting frequent zoom sessions with schools in other countries! I remembered my child sharing with me about meeting other children from Afghanistan, Finland, Japan, and many more. On top of this, the teachers also share current affairs and news stories with the children weekly!  There were also many opportunities for the children to go on outings and learn from real life experiences. From museums to hypermarkets, my child even had the chance to do stand up paddling during one excursion to a swim school!  I also loved how my child has many opportunities to perform and build up her confidence. On every occasion such as cny, vesak day, graduation ceremony, all children from all level would have the chance to perform in plays and dances. Such exposure are extremely important and valuable.  These 5 years, the teachers at My Little Gems has taken such good care of my child and provided her with valuable experiences and beautiful memories which I couldn't find anywhere else. Ben and his team of educators has gone the extra mile to nurture every child and bring out the potential in them. A big thank you to the team for always putting in so much effort! Because of all your dedication, I'm able to go to work with a peaceful mind everyday. Sending my children to My Little Gems Preschool is one of the best decisions I've made in my life. No regrets at all!, It was such an enlightening and fulfilling experience to visit the Tembusu Elderly Care Centre with the children from My Little Gems. Having the opportunity to participate and be an example to our kids was a very memorable experience. Seeing the children in action also showed us what they are capable of, showing compassion and kindness to others and gratitude for what they have.  We have always appreciated the life lessons that Nathan learns from school. His interactions with society, learnings from current affairs and lessons in values, open up a lot of conversations at home where we can share our thoughts and show him how we can put these principles into practice. Whenever he comes home with a new experience or ideas, it facilitates him expressing how he feels about the things he has learned.  More than the academic lessons, we find the life learnings and personal development invaluable to Nathan‚Äôs growth. Thank you Teachers and Staff of My Little Gems!, Good learning place for building good foundation for children from PG to K2 with reasonable school fees.  Well disciplined school and teachers are very kind to kids.  Also fun for kids with different kind of outdoor activities.  Kids are also learnt to know kindness, care for others and forgiveness.  Recommend for parents who willing to build your child in good character, discipline and ultimately good educational foundation., Both my children are currently attending MLG and they really enjoy their time in school.  I appreciate the effort put in by Ben and his team to inculcate not only book knowledge but also the relevant life values and skills to both kids.  Keep up the good work!, Really appreciate the care and dedication of the teachers, esp Teacher Ye Qin. Remembered how she injected fun into the lessons during the HBL period with virtual song and dance on top of the usual lessons, the intro to nature (and planting in the garden in school) & love for recycling (that my child insisted I take a picture of her recycling to show the teacher) and the weekly Monday stories where they had to reflect after that. My child also learnt to work with others & the importance of teamwork and this was useful when she entered p1. And while my child graduated in the midst of the pandemic, Teacher Ye Qin filmed and put together a wonderful graduation concert with the children (& with safe distancing measures) that was memorable and brought cheer to everyone. Well done and thank you so much!, Loving and kind teachers at My Little Gems! We love that Current Affairs, and mindfulness are part of the core curriculum. Communication channels are always open and direct. Much appreciated!, Ruiying missed most about preschool was her friends. She has many good friends & now suddenly, she is the only one in an unfamiliar school. She enjoyed the times she shared with her peers & teachers in MLG, reminiscing the naughty happenings. She also mentioned there are 5 friends in Maha Bodhi Primary School & she is now left alone. She is trying to adjust to the new environment. She missed auntie Helen & auntie Ho cooking. She was cheeky to shared that there is now no teacher to make her drink water, which teacher Joyce enforced that she drank water before she was able to go home., This school is close to our heart ! My son spent his cheerful 2 years here and made lots of memories . Would highly recommend my little gems to all the pre schoolers . Lovely environment and Mr Ben‚Äôs warmth makes this school the next place to home ., Apart from having a robust academic curriculum,the school also emphasizes on character building eg inculcate compassion and kindness in our young children..I love that it is a school that teaches the children ""mindfulness"" since young, My children have good experiences with My Little Gems. They have good teachers who impart knowledge, good characters and etc., Focus on character building. Positive character builds a great leader., Grateful for the warm, loving teachers and conducive environment for my 2 children to grow up safely in‚Ä¶, Nice preschool, I am very lucky that my daughter has been admitted to My Little Gem, a kindergarten full of love, and it has been a year in the blink of an eye. We moved to Singapore from Hong Kong more than four years ago. Due to the impact of COVID, we waited until our daughter turned three years old before starting N1. She quickly adapted to school life. It has now risen to N2. This kindergarten, which is based on Buddhist thought, does not actually have many religious elements. It mainly teaches children to care for the people and things around them. It also encourages children to go into the community, visit nursing homes, visit markets, participate in volunteer activities, etc. , so that children can not only learn to think positively, but also experience and practice the values ‚Äã‚Äãof great love advocated by the school. We communicate in Cantonese at home, and we are taught in English and Chinese at school. However, we are not required to stop using Cantonese and respect the parents‚Äô decision. Another unique feature of My Little Gem is that it trains students to practice meditation from an early age, which can improve concentration and help learning. Through various courses in the classroom, in addition to learning basic skills such as reading and writing, teachers will also take into account other aspects, including the development of physical coordination, personality growth, artistic creativity, etc. A learning progress chart is also provided every week so that parents can have a deeper understanding and help children review at home so that they can make greater progress. What impressed me most about My Little Gem was attending the graduation ceremony and student performance held by the school at the end of last year. Both the little ones in the PG class and the older brothers and sisters who were preparing to enter elementary school were all very involved in the performance. . The teachers behind the scenes really spent a lot of time and effort to lead a class of children under seven years old to give such a wonderful performance. Only caring teachers can do this., I am very happy that my child can grow up here. The principal, teachers and even the staff in the kindergarten are very patient with the child, and my child has also learned a lot of rules here. The best thing is that the food here is vegetarian. Yes, children are not picky eaters at all when they have many friends eating together, and they are becoming more and more fond of vegetarian food. Next, the child learns to meditate. Meditation makes his mind easy to settle down. Meditation is a very good habit for children living in a fast city. I have also recommended many of my friends‚Äô children to come here to study. Everyone thinks it is a very good choice!, Great Buddhist school. The activities are novel and the teachers are loving. Thank you teachers for helping your children grow up!, The teachers and principal at My Little Gems Preschool are caring and patient!"
My Little Kingdom @ West Coast,"We just love My Little Kingdom‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è I'm delighted to share my positive review of My Little Kingdom Preschool. The teachers at this school are not only good but also incredibly kind and nurturing. They create a warm and welcoming environment where children thrive. The curriculum is designed to make learning fun, with a wide range of activities that keep the kids engaged and excited about education. Field trips üåøüåøüåøare a fantastic addition, making the learning experience even more enjoyable and interesting. My child has truly blossomed at My Little Kingdom, and I couldn't be happier with our choice. It's a wonderful place for children to grow and learn. Every morning she is happy to go to school, she asks to go earlier‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏èso that she can spend more time at school., We're so happy that we found My Little Kingdom (MLK)! Overall as parents, we're so grateful for the teachers and staff for being so kind and nurturing. You can really feel the love the teachers feel towards their students. I couldn't really ask for more.  Our daughter entered when she was about 3 years old, and now she's graduating from MLK to Primary. We're just so happy with her development from being shy to now being a lot more outgoing! When she comes home from school we're always delighted to see the little activities and crafts that they're doing. She's also made lots of friends there where they go on playdates even on weekends. I'm really happy we decided to go with MLK for our daughters preschool.  Kudos to Ms. Yvonne, the principal because she's definitely bringing in the right teachers who truly love the students even if they're having a bad day, or entering school in a not so good mood. Our little one is a bit sensitive, so there are times when she goes to school crying, but whenever we ""peek"" inside with what they're doing she's just so happy at school! Plus, from talking with other parents, the teachers really see the gifts of each child and nurtures them.  If MLK had a primary school, we'd definitely still continue to send our kids here too!, My daughter recently graduated from My Little Kingdom. MLK has provided a nurturing environment to her over the last 5 years. Thanks to the dedicated team at MLK and its all-rounded curriculum, my child is well prepared for primary school. I would definitely recommend My Little Kingdom to all parents who are looking for a happy and loving pre-school to entrust their children to!, My daughter Summer attended to MLK from the age of 2 to 6, from Toodlers to K2. The school is one of the Safe Haeven for her while I am working. I am thankful to MLK Teachers, Vice Principal, staff (Aunty Jenny) and specially to Ms Yvonne for building a good foundation of learning for Summer and for preparing her for Primary 1. I am confident that with all the teachings, the love and care MLK had given Summer in the past four years will help her conquer the next learning journey in big school. We will definitely missed the teacher and MLK family., My Little Kingdom was a great phase for our daughter to start learning, communicating, and being active. It was great for us as well being new to parenting!, Both my boys had a most memorable and enriching experience with MLK! The teachers there are very caring towards the children and would constantly plan fun and exciting activities to keep the children engaged such as cookery, outdoor and themed activities. MLK also inculcates important core values such as mindfulness, respect and courtesy etc. My boys thoroughly enjoyed their preschool education and I would strongly recommend MLK to parents!, My son attended pre school at My Little Kingdom and he has just progressed to primary one. It was one of his best experiences in his growing up years as you can just see the shine in his smile whenever he is back from MLK and talks non stop about the stuff he did in school and the school mates he had. Most importantly, he had such great teachers  that encourages him and build his confidence. Special mention to Principal Yvonne for his commitment, dedication and passion. She does everything with a heart and how the children adores her is a testament of how close she is to her ‚Äúchildren‚Äù in MLK. I highly recommend MLK as the staff are all dedicated, environment is clean and the curriculum build character on top of academic preparation for Primary One. Keep up the good work Principal Yvonne and her team. And thanks for giving my son such a fantastic journey., A very good school where my little boy spent for theblast 3 years. The teachers are very kind and knowledgeable., Children attended from ages 3 to 6. I am very grateful to be able to learn English and Chinese here. I also think that being able to meet wonderful teachers and make many non-Japanese friends was an experience that will last a lifetime. When I see my children happily talking about their day's events when they come home from My Little Kingdom, I think this is a really good kindergarten. Even though my parents had just arrived in Singapore and were not familiar with English, they were very kind and thorough in explaining what was going on at the nursery school, and I am grateful for their thoughtfulness. If you are having trouble choosing a kindergarten in Singapore, we recommend My Little Kingdom."

MY World Preschool Ltd (Bukit Batok West Plains 1),"My daughter is in PG at My World West Plains. Her teachers are very gentle, patient and caring. They notice her milestones readily, share feedback at regular intervals, and the half-yearly portfolio that is shared with parents contains specific milestones and phrases that my daughter uses.  The school‚Äôs facilities are new and modern and the layout is spacious and bright. The school is also very prompt with updates about covid, HFMD and other health concerns  and issues. Our daughter enjoys going to school very much! Thank you My World for being a great place for her to learn and grow., Poor attitude from my child's N2 CARING teachers. Asked them questions in the app, including the VP, but they don't bother to reply.  Promoted to K1 CARING and the N2 teachers (admin and management too) didn't bother to pass down important instructions, such as wearing mask when child is in the centre, to the K1 teachers.  Basically, the attitude of the lot in that centre is very poor, blatantly show not-my-responsibility attitude toward us. Gotten a couple of feedback from my child's friends' parents there that the centre's organisation and management are appalling., My child was in Infant care to PG and then to N1 in this school. Just to share within a year of opening, they have changed 3 Principals. From IFC to PG, I had good experience with the teachers and the first Principal who is known to be motherly but she left shortly after. My kid also enjoyed school during the PG times. The teachers were good. However things started to take a turn for worse after the second P came in, unfriendly and no empathy for kids and parents. My kid was transiting from PG to N1 in December and was injured but no proper care or concern was given, and the Second P gave all sorts of excuses and have no intention to support parents in their concerns and worries. Little did I know she was already serving her notice period but still that was very unprofessional of her to push the blame to the kids for rejecting proper first aid care. Parents was not informed as well until I discovered the wound myself. I escalated to HQ and originally they said the sch ( which is the P) will take it up but I was furious that they didn‚Äôt wan to take up the case themselves as ultimately we go to HQ for a reason , because the P wasn‚Äôt able to handle parents concerns and feedback well. Eventually, we withdraw our kid as we are not comfortable with the level of care by the N1 teacher and my kid dread n had nightmares every night. I Didn‚Äôt ask for cctv or go to Ecda since we are already withdrawing. Was a disappointing experience. The new P who has joined recently and according to my friends who still have kids there, they had recent bad experience as well with the P. In summary, with the recent experience, I won‚Äôt recommend the school now., nice teachers, professional communication. highly recommended to send your child here for early development."

MY World Preschool Ltd (Kang Ching),"My daughter got bitten by her classmate. It happened   4 times since we transfered her early this year. Teachers will call to tell you the incident, but no follow up on how they will bridge the gap so as for it not to happen again. As it happened multiple times is really upsetting as a parent. I was wondering where are the teachers when it happened., Good."

And the new principal is very on the ball and we have seen a lot of activities and updates on the parent app recently. 100% recommend. Given it is a highly subsidised programme, do indicate your interest via Ecda early!, Terrible experience.  1) the place is supposed to open on Saturdays but when we dropped off on a Saturday due to errands, they didn‚Äôt allow the kid to stay‚Äî did everything to make us bring our child home.  They didn‚Äôt even let him step a foot into the facility, even though he willingly wanted to go and play.  2) the ‚ÄúTeachers‚Äù play favouritism and will bully those children they don‚Äôt like and those are usually kids who don‚Äôt ‚Äúlisten to everything they say.‚Äù"
MY World Preschool Ltd (Pasir Ris),"interested in their centre so called up to book a visit but the lady told me can only visit at certain hours. when I want  to visit at the timing they specified, she asked for DOB etc etc...not very willing to let me visit. When I said I preferred the half-day programme. The staff said most of the children are in full-day prog. When I asked if they have half-day prog, she kept brushing me off and refused to talk about it and then told me the price difference it not much and that they give priority to child enrolled in full day programme. It is a really bad reflection of the centre., They won't entertain you if you aren't Citizen or PR, waited for around 3 months, no response for play group admissions!"

From the very beginning, the administrative staff has been exceptional in their communication. The updates provided by the teachers and the use of the school app have been invaluable in keeping me informed and made me feel connected to the school community. Additionally, the personal check-in with the principal was a thoughtful gesture.  The school itself is clean and beautiful with quite a few engaging learning and play areas. It is evident that great care is taken to create an environment that fosters both education and enjoyment. I highly recommend this school if you are seeking an outstanding educational experience for your children.  I would like to express my gratitude to the hardworking team for their dedication. They give me confidence that my child is in good hands and also made this new process of ""schooling"" enjoyable for the children. Thank you!, Tampines Greenview Center is the best place for a child to begin his/her learning journey. A safe, clean, and spacious environment, makes us feel confident that my child is in good hands. We observed her participating in every single activity carefully crafted by the teachers with the best interest of the students in mind, and it is remarkable how much she enjoys each and every one of them. Our sincere thanks go out to the Principal, Teacher Mandy, and Teacher Wang. You are the RAINBOW of our child!"

Apart from their commitment to deliver good education to the students, they are also very caring and loving teachers to the children. The center also provides constant upgrading programmes for the teachers, had strong religious teachings to interest the boys and girls.

Kids have lots of activities to build their learning curiosity, and school is always very clean. If you're thinking of enrolling your infant, put them on waiting list much much earlier.

Newton Kindergarten,"Newton Kindergarten is a very loving kindergarten which is well managed with a lot of good teachers and principal.  The children are very lively and it focus on bilingual studies which gives children a well balanced education.  It also have many creative art and craft where kids have fun in doing. It has a very central location with 2 levels of carpark.  It is very convenient as well because its directly outside a bus stop.  I used to study in Newton Kindergarten and it's a vibrant place to growing up in.  #ILoveNewtonKindergarten, My daughter graduated from NK 4 years ago. Until now, she still has fond memories of the school. The school has prepared her well for primary school education., Am 21 now, went here when i was a kid, and was inspired to write this years later after a conversation about our kindergarten lives as kids. I recall it being terrible, being made fun of by the teachers when i couldnt do splits in gymnastic classes, being discriminated for my poor chinese, being put at the back of the class because I was a little slow, having the teachers ignore me when i needed help, constantly being scolded for being on the quiet side, overall really emotionally scarring and not what you can expect out of a christian/catholic kindergarten. parents do consider if you are going to send your kids here, i know i would NEVER send my children here and i encourage those around me to never consider this kindergarten., I am Olivia Quek. I graduated from this school in 2017 and I am now a Primary Six in Raffles Girls‚Äô Primary School. I had so much fun at this school. The teachers were all very caring and kind, especially ÂàòËÄÅÂ∏à, a teacher I have been trying to find but unfortunately I do not have her contact. She was my favourite teacher and I think she is an amazing Chinese teacher. I feel indebted to her for creating my passion for Chinese and caring for me as if I was her own child. I feel like I learnt a lot at this school, building my foundation for English and Chinese to help me excel in Primary School. Thank you and I hope your children have similar experiences."

The pool is wonderful for those looking for a swim or for families!!, Nice place."
Odyssey The Global Preschool - Dempsey,"When I first came to see the Dempsey campus I was in awe of the beauty of the school, from the surroundings to the clean classrooms to the facilities and most importantly the always smiling, friendly faces of the staff. My son is so happy here - he can‚Äôt wait to go to school in the morning and literally have to drag him home at the end of the day!, Kid has been attending for a while. The campus is beautiful, there's a lot of outdoor play and such a wide range of activities (music, cooking, PE, etc) that I don't feel any need to arrange anything else and we just have relaxed evenings and weekends.  Teachers are great and I can see my kid is really comfortable with them, showing them her true mischievous self when she's normally very shy around unfamiliar adults. She's eating / drinking / napping / growing / developing very well and I really couldn't ask for much more., Odyssey Dempsey has got conducive learning environment for little ones. Great to have sufficient space and compound for exploration and play. Witnessing our child grow and develop with warm encouragement by the team of teachers does provide us parents the confidence that our child is in good hands üëçüèª ‚Ä¶, We are very happy with the odyssey Dempsey !! The teachers , support staff and infrastructure are all the best one can get in singapore in a Preschool. We love the outdoor Forest feature!! And our son is learning so much as well. We are very happy with our choice !!, Very fun experience and to see the kids learn some business supply chain acumen :) could have been better organised in terms of knowing where to go at what time.

Knowing that my child is in good hands of the passionate staff here makes me confident that he will be able to grow and explore in a safe and nurturing environment., Friendly staff who are professional and accessible. Well organised, happy, beautiful and modern campus surrounded by greenery., Great event and the kids enjoyed themselves so much !, great campus with forest adventure, Great school, love grounds!, Overpriced relative to quality of teachers"
Odyssey The Global Preschool Pte Ltd (Fourth Ave),"Thanks to all the teachers for giving the kids and parents a wonderful experience and for us to know their life in school better. Gege definitely enjoyed back to preschool too. ‚Äî Jian En, Both my kids attend/ed Odyssey and my husband and I are extremely satisfied with our choice. It provides a happy, nurturing and dynamic environment for the little ones to be educated in. The teachers know every child by name and it‚Äôs evident the school goes the extra mile to create that personal culture. We couldn‚Äôt be happier!, As a parent, picking the right pre-school for your child can sometimes feel like having to choose between conflicting priorities. Academics vs social and emotional intelligence, a robust curriculum vs a play-led approach. But with Odyssey, I found a school that balances all these aspects, set in a nurturing environment. My children love going to school and have grown into confident and resilient learners, who are intellectually curious and engaged with the world. I would definitely recommend the school to any parent., All my three children spent their entire preschool days at this most nurturing kintergarden. We are so happy for the syllabus and curriculum and can‚Äôt be more grateful for the teachers and all the staffs. One of my kids was initially a very reserved and shy person but after started at odyssey she has become so confident and open minded and willing to explore different things. There has been zero days for the stretch of past 8 years that any of my kids would complain not wanting to go to school. While I understand academic is important I do believe good manner, discipline and character building are equally important at the early childhood days. Odyssey has shaped up their personalities and helped them to build up solid social skills and we are forever grateful towards the time we spent there., I have moved into the neighbourhood and had changed 2 other schools prior because of I could not confidently say my girl is well taken care of at school. The 4th Ave Odyssey school was our 3rd school since moving and I confidently say it is the best I've seen.  There is world-class communication to parents; honest, transparent and timely. This is not taken for granted at all- I am grateful for comprehensive yet informative updates to us as parents.  Every time there is an event, you can sense there is proper though-through and not a haphazard set-up like most schools. There is also a deep respect for parent's time so that when we come and make time for our kids, we really feel like there is a meaningful engagement. The facilities, not just the space, but is incredibly well-maintained, well-thought out that is condusive for the kids. I really have nothing but praise for this remarkable school that I would love to attend as a kid myself.  Every aspect of this school is nothing short of exemplary. On top of it all, the most important thing; creating an environment children love to have fun in and create joy in learning. The bubbles, the music...running operations from the perspective of the child and the parent are definitely short in supply in the preschool industry., Have spoken to many preschool teachers, principals and staff around the area before settling down with Odyssey 4th avenue, and I‚Äôm glad to say it was the perfect choice for my daughter. It‚Äôs got the right balance of emphasis on values, academics, and creativity. The teachers (Ms Denise and Ms Victoria in particular) are a some of the best teachers I‚Äôve met, who truly go the extra mile for the children. The admin and other teaching support staff are always on hand to answer any concerns I have, and feedback is always taken seriously and followed up. My daughter‚Äôs happy to stay with this school until graduation and I‚Äôd gladly recommend 4th Ave to friends., My two daughters studied at Odyssey Fourth Avenue. They thoroughly loved the school; from the school environment, the great outdoor spaces to the curriculum to the caring teachers and staff.  My two children thrived and developed well and most importantly, in an all-rounded manner. We will recommend Odyssey to parents/families looking for a highly curated pre-school environment., It is the best preschool in singapore for me. The teachers are kind and helpful. They do care about each child. My son needs lot of attention and assistance, they are kind and make sure he could keep up with his friends. Children here are kind and gentle. Ideal place ‚ù§Ô∏è, My older child cried for 6 months straight at drop off and the school reassured me that he would stop crying as soon as he entered the classroom. This was admit Covid where the parents were not allowed a step beyond the school gate let alone the classroom. So I believed the school and believed the fact this is the most reputable nursery brand on this island. Until one day I chatted with the class teacher when she said to me ‚Äú which child likes to go to school like which adult likes to go to work‚Äù and ‚Äúyour son wouldn‚Äôt stop crying so I told him I‚Äôll never talk to him again if he doesn‚Äôt stop‚Äù in these literal words in Chinese. There were two teachers one English speaking and one Chinese each class and each teacher gave opposing feedback. This glorified bi-lingual system also meant in my case some sort of feud between the two of them with complaints regarding unequal pay and treatment from the school ! This feud was so obvious when 6 months later I was finally able to sit in one of the classes. I decided to open up and say something upon seeing the viral video of child abuse at a Woodlands nursery recently. When your child is unable to communicate clearly and refuses to go to school there is a reason and I regret not believing in my child from the beginning. I thought I knew better, the school knew better but the child was honest about his feelings all along. I urge all parents to listen in to their kids first and foremost., Wonderful school with good sop. Attentive teachers towards my children and constant update and feedback. My twins attended still Road campus for a year followed by 4th Ave campus. They had a good learning journey with Ms Amy, Ms Mirah and Ê≤àËÄÅÂ∏à in discovers. Ms Mirah moved up with them and had two other teachers Ms Natalie and ÈªÑËÄÅÂ∏à. Whenever I faced problems with the children, the school team will work with me to educate and cultivate good teachings and upbringing to the children! A great school to go to!, Love the ambience there. The outdoor space provides an alternative learning experience. My kids adapt well there. They learnt about independent. My son does not eat vegetable, but only at school, he would finish, and not being a picky eater. Teachers were attentive, and communicate well with the parents. And do things in sync with what's happening at home. Great teacher and student ratio., Odyssey is a fun school, where children gets to learn through playing. Teachers are very caring and patient towards to children. We are really enjoying sending our children to Odyssey., thank you to the teachers (ms clarice, ÂàòËÄÅÂ∏àÔºåms iza, ms amy) for the dedication and passion. thank you to the school and all staff for taking care of our kid, and for handling kids' illnesses well too., I have 2 kids and Odyssesy has not only mould them into future leaders but most importantly focus on grooming their interests towards learning.

In terms of food, campus hygiene, hardware, facilities, greenery, environment, and teaching team, the quality of teachers is the best in Singapore. My two eldest daughters have long since graduated and they both said they most want to return to Odyssey. We also met many like-minded people in Odyssey.

The fees are not what you would normally call inexpensive.

I believe all classes are designed perfectly as my daughter could learn new things and knowledge very fast from school, and come back home to share with me proudly :D, Fantastic school, little one is enjoying her time there with all the space and the activities the organise, Wonderful place for our kids - dedicated teachers and excellent programmes topped with wonderful open spaces., Outstanding preschool, our son has been enrolled there since Bambino (infant care) days and he continues to enjoy himself daily.  The quality of care afforded by the staff, both top-down (principal to teachers) and bottom-up, is excellent. My wife and I have the utmost confidence of Odyssey Wilkinson‚Äôs pedagogy and teaching standards.  Information dissemination to parents is generally good, though there is room for improvement in terms of clarity and detail.  The principal and her team are engaging and open to constructive feedback - trust they will always keep up the high standards and consistently engage parental views on improving the standard of care, cleanliness, etc. of the preschool., An interesting preschool with good exposure and well-thought curriculum. It has fantastic space and facilities for pre-schoolers to roam, interact, discover and learn. The teachers are qualified and engaging and the staff including the Head of School approachable and helpful. A worthwhile experience to be with Odessey Wilkinson. Keep up the excellent work!, At Odyssey Wilkinson, I‚Äôm assured that my children are receiving quality care and learning opportunities that build character, emotional, social and problem solving skills. From the very first day, we were warmly welcomed to the Odyssey family, and I‚Äôm very thankful that my children are well taken care of by caring, professional and loving teachers, specialists, mentors, leadership and support staff. I‚Äôm also very impressed by the level of commitment that the pedagogue teams have displayed especially in providing updates and collaborating with us parents to help my children improve in various aspects of their development.  Thank you all at Odyssey Wilkinson for all you do!, Been here for a term so far and I have thoroughly enjoyed the experience so far! Great communication with teachers and my son‚Äôs mandarin has improved so much since joining. I am always kept aware of what he is learning in school and how he is doing. Thank you Odyssey! Happy 15 years!, This school is always amazing at making my son happy! From art classes to music classes to gym play class, the teachers were very creative and engaging. It makes drop offs easy because kids always look forward to the activities in school., We‚Äôve had a wonderful experience at Odyssey so far. We have two kids attending they are always coming home happy and with stories to share. The school involves parents in many activities which we appreciate. Thank you!, Odyssey Preschool At Wilkinson has a good learning environment , big green space, caring & thoughtful teachers and staff, creating such wonderful experience for my boy who has been attending this preschool since toddlers years. Having been in this school for the 4th year , i continue to believe the teachers give their best to mould him to an all- rounded preschooler ready for the next stage of schooling. The music, art and fitness classes are classes he enjoys alot every year, exposing him outside regular class curriculum. Excursions, school events, water plays, and more events to the list . A preschool that parents should put on your consideration list when choosing a preschool. Kudos to the team at Wilkinson Odyssey! Thank you., Odyssey is the best! Best teachers, the whole community knows one another and there is a very strong support system. Love the curriculum where kids get to explore and enjoy their childhood., Lovely experience for the kids and beautiful green space. Our kids love it here, Happy 15th Odyssey Wilkinson! It‚Äôs been a wonderful experience seeing our kids grow up happily in this beautiful campus, surrounded by caring teachers. Keep going!, Happy 15years Odyssey! All the kids and teachers in Wilkinson did so well to put up many great performances under the hot sun today! What a great Jamboree day!, This is the great school! my child love the teachers and the school so much! if i have another child will send to odyssey too!, It's Excellence made into a Preschool. Everything is clean, organized, and most importantly, made for children. From the 1st day we felt a warm welcome and a strong and genuine concern for my child¬¥s wellbeing. Couldn¬¥t recommend enough! Thank you!, Amazing preschool and caring teachers. The facilities are clean and well maintained. We especially love the outdoor canteen, Outstanding pre-school with caring staff, engaging curriculum, and safe environment. Highly recommend for early childhood education., Not only is it one of the most beautiful environments for my little guy to start learning, but I am constantly impressed by how invested the entire staff is on my son‚Äôs personal development., We have been to many pre school. This is best school eva! The teachers, the curriculum & the environment. ‚ù§Ô∏è, Wholesome experience for my kids in Odyssey. Great teaching team and experience!, My children love school and I the caring teachers, supportive staff and ample outdoor space., Unprofessional and money-minded principal. Oversold their capacity and told us our daughter won‚Äôt have a place after the first year when it was promised that she would keep her place all the way to pre-primary. Disappointing experience and from conversations with other parents, this is a principal to avoid., Great teachers and well thought out curriculum for my 2 year old toddler. Thank you., This school is fantastic, the teachers are incredibly committed, the curriculum is carefully crafted, the food is varied and the ground/garden is one of a kind. I wish I could go back to school myself!, Really enjoyed the whole event‚Ä¶ seeing kids and staff doing all the hard work the make event extra special .. kiddos to odessey team for organising such a large event smoothly, one of the privileged few centres in singapore with wide open spaces that offer free spirited learning for children, Beautiful school and lovely teachers, Extremely fun and well-organised event. Kudos to the teachers and all the students! :), Very kind teachers and friendly staffs. Highly recommended!, Wonderful teaching team and lovely campus - best decision ever!, Love the school and everything that the staff does for our kids! We couldn‚Äôt be happier, It was very well planned and well executed. Enjoyed the whole experience! Well done, Good teachers and campus, will miss it!, Teachers who lied, a principal who cover up the lies... one of the most expensive and lousy school ever.  One would expect better care from a supposedly 'atas' school, The best in SG!, Beautiful school with a warm group of staff., Probably the best pre-school in Singapore!, Great environment, The prefect place to send our children. Lovely., Great event. Great place., Amazing teachers and energy, Amazing Experience here!, Great, Odyssey Wilkinson is AWESOME!!!!, Great campus"

They spent money on hiring camera man to record video in graduation concert that your child is participating, and did not mentioned if this covered in the previous money charged to the parents, and they try to sell this video to parents after the event. Which mean as parent, you need to pay money for the concert, pay money for extra ticket for siblings, and then pay money for the concert‚Äôs recorded video. If you don‚Äôt pay, then you won‚Äôt get the video that has been recorded even though you have already paid quite many money for the same event.

My baby at school improve alot in motoring skills and is more active.  For the cleanliness outside the PCF or the block, it should be the responsibility of all stakeholders in that area not only PCF.  As long the inside PCF school is clean and hygiene, I have no issue.

PCF Sparkletots Preschool @ Pasir Ris West Blk 650 (EY),"My son attended this branch for a few months. He would cry traumatically every time we brought him there. I've seen and heard caretakers inside telling the kids to ""sit down and shut up"". In the mornings, the kids are forced to just quietly at the table. During dismissal, they are chucked in a room to watch tv while waiting for parents to pick them up. During outdoor times, I've seen them brought to the void deck and caretakers are generally disengaged. I've seen them made to sit in a line and pass a ball along. Very boring.  I pulled my son out of the school after a few months due to the terrible conditions. It's been 4 years since the experience. I live in the neighbouring block, and as I WFH, every morning without fail, I will hear several children scream and cry traumatically when they are being dropped off. I feel so sorry for the children who are put in this branch of PCF SparkleTots. It must be terrribly traumatic for them. The caretakers put on a show during the parent-teacher meetings and open house, but I've seen the reality of daily operations. I can hear the screams and cries every day.  I know it is normal for some children to cry when dropped off. I heard cries with the new school I placed my son in, but it was never at that level of intensity and trauma / fear.  In stark contrast, the new school I enrolled my son in allows for open play time before/after classes where they can roam and mingle freely (pre-covid days) with others and enjoy social interaction. Outdoor times are more interactive and genuine.  Is this the level of care and professionalism that government pre-schools offer??"

The excitement quickly dwindled once I began the assessment process.  I mentioned that my daughter has a speed delay issue and the energy from the centre became less welcoming once I disclosed the information. We were quite surprise with the response we received, as it is important for any educational centre to cater to the needs of their students, regardless of their learning differences.  Furthermore, I was asked to provide a full report from a specialist at KKH. While this may have been necessary for their assessment process, it added to the time and effort required on my end.  Lastly, the lack of communication and delayed response from the centre regarding the status of my application was disappointing. It seems that the principal was the only person who could make the decision and unfortunately, was unavailable due to illness (couple of weeks). However, it would have been more professional if someone else from the centre had been able to provide updates on the status of my application in a timely manner.  I still feel that the lack of response and the unwelcoming energy from the principle, this particular centre will not take kids less than normal.

Picket Fence @ Tampines Pte Ltd,"I‚Äôm super thankful for the exceptional early childhood education provided by Picket Fence @ Tampines. The teachers here are not just professionals; they embody a genuine love for children that truly shines through in everything they do. From the moment my child stepped into their care, I knew he was in nurturing hands.  One of the things that sets this school apart is their dedication to keeping parents well-informed about their child's progress. The regular updates we receive about our son's development and how he's faring in school give us immense peace of mind. It's reassuring to know that the teachers are not only invested in the academic aspect but also in the holistic growth of each child.  I can confidently say that enrolling my child at Picket Fence @ Tampines has been one of the best decisions we've made for his early education. I wholeheartedly recommend this school to any parent seeking a nurturing environment where their child can thrive., Visited the centre yesterday, principal was patient enough to answer all my questions and concerns, classrooms are clean and engaging üëç ‚Ä¶, Parent who reading this, unbiased and honest review.  If you considering putting your little one here. Read this first.  As a parent, looking for your little one preschool is like seeking job. So I called LFP and was told there‚Äôs a slot available.  So we asked to secure the slot, was been told to pay registration fee to secure that‚Äôs all.  We offered to make a trip down, however the school said do a tour first and make payment. So we agreed.  The unprofessional and horrible part begin, on weekend the school tour. We was on our way down the school. 30mins before the school tour, received a text from the school.  We have our last sign up and currently full for now. Would you still want to come for school tour?  This is horrible and unpleasant experience happened to us. If we been told beforehand. All this could prevented it. It‚Äôs such a letdown management and speechless., Alot of viruses in school and is not minor viruses. Is a serious virus which needed to be hospitalized. School hygienes is very very bad., This school or rather I can say is worst than hospital..  They have as much virus as hospital. Almost every month for 1-2 weeks sometimes 3 weeks definately have virus outbreak.  They will use another virus term to make sure parents are not aware of the outbreak so it looks not that scary., I‚Äôm an unbiased and a working mother. Admin Sofia is terrible at her work. She doesn‚Äôt know the clauses in the agreement but she can get signatures during enrolment.  She didn‚Äôt even submit the withdrawal of my child until I call her and asked about the status since my kids new school couldn‚Äôt enrol her.  Worst service. Not fee worthy at all, The teachers make a world of difference. Warm and comfortable environment."
PlayFACTO School @ Aljunied,"I like their robotics and coding courses using Korean patented MODI modules. They make it very easy for young children to learn coding and robotics in a fun way. Unconsciously, children pick up creative thinking skills. A good foundation for children to grow in STEAM knowledge., Heard a lot about PlayFACTO student care centre and the curriculum it offers which includes creative maths and robotics. The centre is pleasantly designed and provides a pleasant environment for the children. Playfacto also provides a wide variety of meals that is sourced from a central kitchen which is nutritious and tasty. Looking forward to your grand opening in Aljunied!, When we step in, we could see that the place is newly renovated, bright, airy, gives a cosy vibe & conducive for learning. This helps break away from the school setting that our son is accustomed to in the morning. With a change in setting, the environment mentally engages his mind and relaxes him, which is a good alternative to home.  We like that there is a structured curriculum in place where the teachers provide guidance on his homework and drill him on spellings. There is also focus on each subject a day where worksheets are provided to deepen their understanding. Not to mention, Fridays where he is empowered to do things that interests him like art & craft or just unwinding for the weekend. On top of this, there is paid for enrichment classes conveniently provided under the same roof. This include robotics and maths that we do not need to locate elsewhere. Our son likes the reading corner and enjoys engaging in puzzles with his peers such as Jig saw, Tangram, Pentomino, Sudoko & others. This center goes beyond the basic looking after your child (e.g. relief teacher) but enriches him academically, socially and holistically as it bridges general knowledge of what is happening around us through holiday programs. It does not disconnect him from the world we live in but provide insights and practical activities that could be as simple as folding plastic bags! With the strong program and purpose that it brings, it makes it easier for us to give our son a more balanced childhood as school related work is mainly settled during weekdays while weekends are reserved for sports, leisure & family time.  With our son onboard this month and multiple communications over prior months, we could witness that Patricia and her teachers are dedicated and passionate with their callings. They will provide us with timely updates on his progress and practical tips on areas that he can work on. Whenever we have a concern on his learning, they are open to listen and flexible to cater to our needs, where possible. This includes emphasis on mandarin, return transport home and transport from school after CCA & extra classes. With an open communication and timely feedback from the school, it assures us as parents that our son is in good hands.  We are happy that we made a right decision to choose Playfacto Aljunied & this is definitely unparalleled elsewhere!, I appreciate the robotics enrichment courses the school provides for its students, I believe it serves as a distinguishing factor of this school, allowing said school to stand out from its competitors. The folks over at the management team are very friendly and answered my queries in a nice and professional way., I am attracted by Playfacto‚Äôs coding and robotics courses using Korean patented MODI. They are learning friendly for young children, building an interest and foundation for STEAM in them. Wish I‚Äôd such opportunities when I was young., I am very impressed by the teachers' quality and environment of Playfacto HQ student care center. Looking forward to the opening of Aljunied center in July 2021, as THE after school care and enrichment option for my child., With current domestic helpers supply crunch, I'm relieved and assured that my child will be in good hands and nice environment when she starts primary one next year., Very responsive management and HQ team who patiently answer all my inquiries. Its location is very near to Aljunied MRT, meets the needs of parents who travel by train., Conducive and spacious environment for children, definitely a place to trust my kids there., Love it! Nurturing place for kids. I would rather send my kids there than staying home play game üòÇ ‚Ä¶, Great resources and amazing teaching of self-motivated attitudes of learning for the kiddos.. Highly recommended!, Great environment for kids!, Nice environment and convenient location, The management treats people seriously and sincerely. I am particularly interested in XueLeFang‚Äôs creative mathematics courses. They use Korean patented math toys to increase children's interest in mathematics and develop and train children's intelligence and thinking. Learning mathematics is no longer boring and boring. Incentivize recommendations!"
Posso Preschool @ Jurong East,"I am incredibly grateful to the dedicated teachers at Posso, led by the nurturing Chen Chunrui Laoshi and her amazing team including LinNa Laoshi and teacher Ng Kim Eng. Their unwavering care and commitment to our child's development have been truly remarkable. We are consistently kept informed about our child's progress and are delighted to receive regular updates and photos showcasing her joyful experiences at school. The exceptional facilities, such as the weekly baby spa sessions at Posso Jurong, have undoubtedly added to our child's happiness. We extend our heartfelt appreciation to the teachers for their warmth and love, which our little one undoubtedly feels every day!  Posso has also a very big and spacious premises with outdoor gardening and playground (including water play). The PG/Nursery and Kindergarten teachers are also very responsive and supportive! üòÄ  Overall, it‚Äôs a Highly recommended preschool. Thank you immensely for your dedication and support üëçüòÄ, My two boys had fantastic time at Posso @ Jurong East. All teachers and staff helped my boys settle in with affection and patience. They made sure to keep my husband and myself updated on how our kids were doing at the start which is highly appreciated.  Admin side - amazingly quick response for any inquiries from finance to teachers.  School facilities -a huge outside play ground and green patches to grow veggies. My kids could run around and go out to smell herbs and witness veggies grow.  School curriculum - they have varied activities to keep kids happy. My kids' favorites were baking, trampolining and learning Chinese.  Many thanks to the principal, Ms Charmaine. We might have gone else where it hadn't been her passion andphilosophy towards children's eduction when we went for school tour.  I would highly recommend this institution to anyone who is after proactive and hands on teaching for their children., My boy has been with Posso preschool since 2019.  We like the caring and loving environment, and how the teachers plan the many events to give the kids different learning experiences.  We enjoy reading the messages from the teachers, which keeps us informed of the progress of our child, and the photos and videos, which helps us understand what our child does and learn in school.  Lastly I wanna express my sincere gratitude to all the Teachers for all the love care and patience given to my boy., We have 3 children studying in Posso since 2015. Our 2nd child will be graduating from K2 this year while our littlest one is in PG currently. The standard of the school staffs, from teachers, to admin, to curricular planners and even the cleaners has always been of the highest level. The dedication of the staffs is obvious to see from their day-to-day duties as well as quarterly excursions and the annual year-end concerts. The teachers must have spent many after-school and weekend hours preparing the props and doing the rehearsal, to make the year-end concert a success. As for curriculum wise, the school is unique in the sense it advocates the ""I can"" attitude and encourages every child to explore and experience, through gardening activities, baking, science experiments and speech and drama. You don't often find a childcare which has its own cookery room, science lab, indoor trampoline gym, garden and water playground! As parents, we want the best for our children and Posso has given us that peace of mind and assurance that our children grow up in a positive and loving environment., Best preschool! Teachers are professional, passionate and patient. The environment is great with spacious indoor and outdoor space. They have rich programs to keep children engaged and learn with funs. That is one of the the best choices we have ever made to send my kid there who really enjoyed. It is sad to say goodbye with kid going to primary school while the memory with posso will go a long way., My child has been with Posso Preschool since she was in PG to K1. I am very happy with the teaching, curriculum and extra curricular activities. The biggest plus is the huge space that they have which the children really need to bring out their energy. Thank you so much for everything ‚ù§, Our Son has been with Posso Pre-school since PG all the way to K2. I could obviously see how his Positive Grow and Progress with their programs in this pre-school. (From Cookery class, Speech & Drama , Indoor Trampoline & more) Highly recommended to any Parents out there to let your kids join this pre-school and see how they amaze you with things that they learn from there., Good school with various programs, children can enjoy cookery class, art, science, speech and drama, outdoor playground, trampoline‚Ä¶ also have an APP to communicate with school, teachers will send some pictures every Friday. Highly recommend!"
Posso Preschool @ Tampines Point Pte Ltd,"My experience with Posso has been a pleasant one and I'm happy with the learning experiences that my children had in their young growing up years with Posso. Their learning were varied and authentic, and I'm thankful for the patient and student-centric staff in the school, who took great care of the children. I chose Posso because of the teacher-student ratio and the different learning environment that were set up for different subjects. Thumbs up for making learning fun for the kids and for the great care and accountability shown! Big thanks to Teacher Athirah and Teacher Angelene!, Our son attended to Posso preschool at around 20 months and he has grown up a lot these years. We still remember his first week in school when he cried a lot for leaving his parents, and now he goes to school happily everyday. Putting on clothes, doing simple Maths, write English letters, greeting others, drawing pictures, confidently giving speeches in front of class, doing performances, enjoying cooking, and much more. All these he learnt at Posso preschool. Posso focuses on cultivating children in all aspects. More importantly, Posso promotes children's interests in learning and respects their rhythm of learning. Here, I am very grateful to the principal and the teachers who have taught our son, especially his English teacher Teacher Demie, Chinese teacher Hong lao shi and Lin Lao shi. It is them who use their patience, love and care to let our son grow up happily in Posso."
Posso Preschool @ West Coast Rise Pte Ltd,My Daughter has been going to this preschool from 18months and she loves it. She‚Äôs really learned a lot since joining and my Wife and I love the fact that it‚Äôs bilingual as we would not have been able to teach her sufficient Chinese at home. I just wish they had an infant care at this branch so that I could have started my Son in the same school.
PPS Ghim Moh,"Both my kids attend this childcare in the Jurong West Branch since they were 2 years old. Teachers are very caring and passionate., Every good"
PPS Yishun,"Best childcare Principal found in Irene. I had to move my boy due to family issues and realised he was socialising and speaking better English here than the current one where he reports daily bullying by other kids. The kids are well-behaved and this is the best childcare i have experienced after trying 3, including 1 branded one. Excellent quality education. Fuss-free admin. Not money-minded. Really here to help kids and socially-challenged families. Extremely encouraging and helpful during pandemic., Best Childcare ever lol . Trf to Pcs after nearby pcf as my special needs with iccp program for SN children.After short while my child with confidence and learns lots of skills and have fun and most of all non special needs teachers were very nice and experience too., very good infant care services and caregivers constantly engaged with parents to provide timely update o n their babies."
Presbyterian Woodlands Childcare Centre,
Pre-School By-The-Park (Dunearn) Pte Ltd,"I read with much doubt the earlier review about supposed poor communication from the school. I venture that the so called ‚Äúreviewer‚Äù must not actually have children in this school because they actually communicate via an app and not email.  Both my younger children go to this preschool (my eldest went to another school)  and they have provided the most meticulous care, excellent communication via a dedicated app through which they send photos of my kids at play and learning reports of the children‚Äôs experiences.  Under their care, both my kids adore going to school and clearly have good relationships with their teachers. I was also very impressed with their teachings syllabus when my second child started being able to read at 4.  The teachers are approachable and friendly as are all of their staff.   This school has been a God -send for my wife and I and we‚Äôd like to thank them for taking such excellent care of our children., My older girl goes to this preschool. It‚Äôs got a nice family feel to it. And the teachers genuinely love kids. My girl comes home with a different hairstyle every day and speaks very fondly of her teachers, Respectful culture, low teacher to student ratio, outdoors everyday ! Good balance between play and academics"
Preschool By-The-Park (Evans),"Checked out several preschools with infant care in our area before touring Evans By The Park through a friend‚Äôs recommendation.  What we like: The teachers across all classes work collaboratively and make it a point to know every child by name. I observed that this helped my kid feel welcomed and settle in.  They emphasise the teacher-parent partnership. We‚Äôre updated on our kid‚Äôs progress and can have open and candid conversations with teachers anytime. They‚Äôre also respectful and open to adapt to our requests when it comes to some of our preferences and styles as parents.  Lots of allocation for open play and time outdoors, with focus on nature, sustainability and community. We are huge believers that young children learn best through imagination and play, and this was a big draw factor.  Happy to have found a childcare partner we can trust for our kid‚Äôs very crucial early years., This school is truly a hidden gem and there are so many things we love about it:  1. Warm, loving and engaging teachers . The teachers really care about the children, and go over and beyond to bring out the best in the children 2. Truly a place where children learn and discover through play 3. Authenticity in their approach. It isn‚Äôt about fancy facilities/ toys. The teachers are incredibly resourceful and love using natural materials and recycled materials as toys, learning tools and props. 4. They teach the kids about sustainability and the environment. Their actions speak louder than words, eg bringing in a company to teach kids how to recycle water in the garden, engaging with a company that has sensors/equipment to ‚Äútalk to trees‚Äù, and moving away from parent-packed snacks to reduce the use of plastic wrappers + inculcate healthier snacks ie fruits provided by the school . 5. Good balance between being play based, but still having an effective method for teaching (eg Spalding for reading) to prep the kids for ‚Äúbig school‚Äù 6. Super collaborative with parents.They are very open to addressing any issues that we as parents have. Parents are welcomed to come into school and see what their kids are up to. I also find that the kids  at BTP are so curious, open, and confident in speaking with parents/ visitors that they meet, A preschool where kids can be kids, where the teachers and the environment nurture a love for learning and curiousity.  The teachers have the ability of turning wooden sticks from their walks, plastic bottle caps crowdsourced from the families and other Knick Knacks into play materials that keep the kids entertained - up-cycling at its best instead of just a buzzword.  If you want your kids to have wonderful memories of childhood (and not memories of doing worksheets and revising for spelling), this school is for you!, Evans by the Park has teachers with the biggest and warmest hearts!  When we first visited the preschool for a tour, we saw up close how the children would play and learn in a natural and holistic manner.  Since infant care and now toddler/playgroup, I can see how much and fast our kid has developed and is thriving.  What moved us the most was participating in the annual carnival which is a charity fundraiser held at an eldercare centre.  Definitely recommend BTP to all my friends with little ones starting preschool!, Nice school for children to play but ineffective teaching - son couldn't read simple words even by the end of graduation. Clearly academics are not a focus. Also terribly difficult to get the $2k+ deposit back after graduation."

Pro-Teach Student Care(Tampines),"It was a difficult decision to make with a student care that is not in the school compound. I remembered I went thru a lot of student care centre 6.5 years ago, and I was glad I chose Pro-Teach Tampines as my choice. The teachers  are very friendly, patience and caring in teaching the students. Not only academically but also nurturing the students to be a better person. Here, I thanked the team of teachers, for the care they have given to my son and always staying late with him because most of the time, I am late in picking him. Pro-teach student care (Tampines) made me having ease of mind because I knew my son is in good hands., We are glad that we had chosen Pro-Teach Tampines for our children. The teachers are very patient, caring and responsible.  They are willing to wait for us whenever we were late. We would like to express our sincere gratitude for their support and guidance for our children during their stay in the center.  Thanks again for everything you have done., We are happy that we have picked Pro Teach Tampines eventhough my child is not studying at the nearby schools and neither are we living near the centre. The teachers are very well experienced, patience and caring. I remember when my child was P1, he disliked homework. Mrs Ang would let him take his own pace until he was at the right mood to study (letting him do his drawing before homework). When my child didn‚Äôt want to attend class, Mr Lim would talk and joke with him to make him at ease until he was ready for lesson. Thanks to Mrs Ang and Mr Lim for the patience., Wonderful place for kids to grow up. Teacher are very friendly and helpful. My children learn a lot from this place. I have 3 children and all of them attend Pro-Teach. My youngest son now is in poly, he still visit the teacher at Pro-teach when he is free."
Pu Ti Child Care Centre,"We have 3 children studying in Pu Ti Child Care. The school serves vegetarian foods, a very good start to encourage children to love vegetables. The teachers are caring and committed. Highly recommended sch!, I have three children, they all attend Pu Ti Childcare and two have graduated. Highly committed teachers who really love their students, well-thought through curriculum and programme to provide holistic development in children, and most importantly, a strong principal who is constantly seeking to innovative and improve all process of the centre. Very thankful to have found this centre., The principal, staffs and teachers at Pu Ti are very attentive and responsible. Appreciate their extra efforts to help my child who had been sick, to catch-up with peers. Keep-up the good work!, Wonderful pre school with caring ,nurturing teachers. They follow a play and learn methodology. This is a great pre school., Sincerely appreciate PuTi childcare center for theirs efforts, caring in guiding our kids in their learnings, Excellent childcare centre by taking good care of the kids and ensuring they learn and proper mannerism, One of the best Child Care centre, caring teachers.

Raffles Kidz @ Ang Mo Kio √¢¬Ä¬ì Best Childcare Centre and Preschool (along Yio Chu Kang Rd),
Raffles Kidz @ Bukit Panjang √¢¬Ä¬ì Best Childcare Centre And Preschool,"My eldest child attends RKI BP.  They're a little on the expensive side but for good reasons.  I think their syllabuses and methods have really encouraged my daughter's development and growth intellectually, emotionally and socially in her 3 years there. No issues in general with the teachers, in fact, they are very friendly, understanding and attentive to both child and parents. So big kudos and shout out to Teacher Geri, Teacher Siti, Huang Laoshi, Wu Laoshi and other amazing teachers at RKI BP.  She really enjoys and looks forward to going to school for her friends and teachers everyday.  If only the fees could be kept at affordable prices otherwise we would have opted RKI for all our kids., My daughter have been with Raffleskidz @ Bukit Panjang since Jan 2023 in Nursery 1... She have always been looking forward to go to school everyday... She did not cry after we send her off in the morning and also after school ends... She's jovial as other children in school! We strongly believe that RKI teachers are doing very well to support the children educations and needs... Teachers were all really good to our daughter and I believe to other children too... Teachers are also very interactive, approachable and friendly with us, parents... And we enjoyed interacting with them... RKI has won many awards and we say that it's a true achievement as we have witnessed it... RKI deserves to maintain the awards every year and also achieve more rewards in the near future..., A preschool with dedicated teachers, rich and extensive programme for the children. Lessons are carried out in fun activities with sensory learning, and encouraging teamwork. Overall, a very good preschool., Our child enjoys going to school and she adores her teachers and friends. We can see she is very happy to be part of the RKI family from her reaction every time we mention she is a student of RKI.  The teachers are caring, responsive to concerns and queries raised. Thank you and kudos to the school management and teachers for creating a nurturing environment for the kids. Please keep up the good work!, Our twins have been with Raffles Kidz @ Bukit Panjang childcare centre since Jan 2023. Through the past 6 months, we have seen them go through critical stages of development with consistent and high-quality care provided. The teachers are well-trained, friendly and always showed care for the children‚Äôs well-being. We have also seen our twin‚Äôs eagerness to go to school every day and they will also happily share with us what they activities they have done when we fetch them back from school., It is a preschool hidden in a dead-end lane second to the main Choa Chu Kang Road. The outdoor playground is great! I wasn‚Äôt very comfortable how playgroup kids are together with nursery toddlers, and that the lunch area is at semi outdoor space, which is very hot at noon time. The high ceiling of the first floor of the landed house is a plus though. The teachers here also seem rather patient. The place is kept nicely and tidely as well. The tuition is around $1100 before subsidy, which is affordable, compared to schools such as mindchamp., Sent my girl to raffleskidz bukit panjang branch since Dec last year. The school did a good job in transiting my girl to school and taught her some independence to feed and clothe herself. I have seen tremendous improvement in my girl and she is much better at expressing herself since she started sch.  Felt at ease sending my girl to school knowing that she learnt alot from all of the fun activities in sch, including water play, craft work, culinary etc. Also special thanks to the teachers, especially ÁæéÁéâËÄÅÂ∏à and Teacher Syahirah, for taking good care of the children., This is my son's first school and I'm thankful that it was at Raffles Kidz. My son enjoys his time and it has been a joy watching him and hearing him blossom into an excited child who enjoys making friends, learning new things and challenging himself. I would like to commend his teachers for making him feel comfortable and safe in the environment of learning. He has thoroughly enjoyed his time and has most certainly grown as a young man. We appreciate the heart that the teachers have for the kids and how meticulous they are in taking care of their wants and needs. Thank you so much, we know that the job isn't easy at all!, I had transferred both my kids to Raffles kidz a year ago and both of them enjoyed the school a lot. Teachers are always so caring and assured me that they are in good hands with the constant updates. School activities are fun and enriching too., We enrolled our son in RKI @ BP in Dec2021 when our son turned 19months old. Initially, we chose RKI because there were no other preschools with vacancies and we thought we'll move him out when we get another preschool with lower school fees. In the end, we decided to stay with RKI for these reasons: 1. Our son shows great improvement in many areas even though he just started less than a year ago. 2. Our son looks forward to go to school everyday now. He only cried for the first couple of days of school. That shows how capable the teachers are to be able to get our son to adapt to a new environment. Our son has mild symptoms of autism so getting him to adapt to a new environment was definitely not easy. 3. The teachers are very prompt in replying to us and are very supportive! Shoutout to Teacher Geri and Meiyu Laoshi. Always updating us on our son's behaviour and learning. 4. We like the curriculum and activities in school too! Especially when we get the photo updates from the teachers every now and then on what they did in school. 5. The monthly newsletter is super helpful for us parents who are working and do not really have the time to chase for updates. We'll get photos and descriptions on what was happening monthly. 6. Almost everyday before our son leaves the school, the principal will always say bye to him and high fived him. It really warm our hearts seeing the principal's action. Thank you Teacher Dee! In conclusion, RKI has gained our trust in not only taking care of our son, but educating him. There are many more reasons but the main ones are these. Many thanks to everyone in RKI!  - Rayhan's mummy & daddy, My kids are happy to go school everyday, as activities and studying are always fun and creative. Teachers are patient and caring, and they will also provide regular updates on my kids' progress in school.  The school has it's own playground, so the chance of them getting in contract with germs are minimize, and also security is also our main concern when it comes to daily outdoor activities.  I have seen great improvement in my kids, and they will definitely miss their friends and teachers when they go to P1 next year and the year after next., We would like to rave about our great experience with Raffles Kidz. While we are searching for preschools around Bukit Panjang area. Raffles Kidz has a good span of curriculum for toddlers. Initially we were worried if our kids can adapt to the new environment. With the dedicated and caring teachers, our kids are in good hands which really ease off our worries while we parents are busy with work. We thank the principal, Dr Dee, Tr Geraldine, Meiyu Laoshi, Tr Siti and Wang Laoshi specially for their love, care and patience towards our kids. After joining Raffles Kidz in less than a year, we see tremendous improvement in terms of speech and learning curve for our kids., Both of my kids are attending this school. My elder on started since 20 months and he‚Äôs now in K2. He looks forward to going to school everyday and has many friends. Academically, I can see that he learns very well and is particularly interested in maths. He told me he loves the food at school as well. Kudos to all the teachers!, To me it is very important that school and teacher respond to parents queries and feedback promptly , and I think RKI BP team did a great job. The Teachers are kind and make the effort to update about my children‚Äôs behaviour and learning too.  Hope that there will be year end concert for the kids this year! A time for parents to see our kids in action üíï, My kids transferred to this school for close to a year already, they love the school and the teachers very much. I like the layout of the school, not only do they have their own outdoor playground, they also have a gardening area and a track for the kids to play on.  My kids love the periodic water-play activities the most. I also like most of the activities they provide for the kids. The teachers put a lot of effort in making the lessons fun and meaningful.  I can see many of their candid photos through the school apps on top of the monthly newsletters which features the kids a lot. Communication with teachers is very easy through the school apps as well as in person.  I'll give a big thumbs up to the schoolüëç, Maximus has been with Raffles kidz BP since he's 20 months! He's looking forward to school everyday and when he came back from school, he will tell us how awesome lunch, activities and teachers were. I can see a great improvement on him especially in language. He's not afraid of communicating with elder kids or even adults at the age of 3 years old. Some of the vocabularies he picked up from the school are pretty impressive.  Kudos to the teachers and management. I've my full confident in letting my son attend the school without zero worries. Health and safety are strict. It wasn't easy for all the teachers to take care of groups of active kids but they have managed it pretty well!  Curriculums and reporting wise are great. The communications apps allowed us to have more understanding on how activities were carried out and catch up with every moments we have missed when they are in school.  Great job overall and this is definitely a school you can rely on, with the group of responsible teachers around.  Special shout out to teacher Dee, teacher Geri, teacher Alicia, Huang Lao shi, meiyu lao shi :) you all have done well and great!, My boy has been attending RKI at BP for the past 5 months. What I like about RKI at BP is their teachers, structured curriculum and the school environment (outdoor playground). The teachers have been putting in efforts to plan engaging lessons and my boy has learn many words and becoming more independent in such a short span of time. The teachers gave prompt responses regarding all our queries and updating us with their learnings weekly in the RKI apps and we really appreciate that. The teachers really cares about the children well-being and giving us as working parents a peace of mind at work., Raffles kids is a good and safe place for the children to learn. I like how well planned the curriculum are, and how the teachers will always keep parents updated on the child progress with pictures and simple summery., Sending my daughter here is the best decision I‚Äôve made. I was initially very worried about her adjustment but she managed to adjust quickly and she‚Äôs so happy in school now that she will wave goodbye happily to us and run in. Her teachers have been really patient and caring and I can tell they really care for the children‚Äôs welfare and development., Enrolled both of my kids at RKI@BP. My kids love going to school and i feel the curriculum is suitable for my kids with a balance of learning and play. Teachers are always cheerful, enthusiastic, patient. This allow me to go to work with no worries as i know they are well taken of.  It may not be the cheapest in this area,  but good enough for us.  :), Both our girls have been with RafflesKidz Bukit Panjang right from the time they turned 18 months. They are now 3 and 5. Through these years, we have seen the girls develop very well in terms of their knowledge and social skills. That has allowed us to really enjoy the communication with our girls when they get home. The teachers at the school have been amazing and we firmly believe that their positive spirits run off very well on our girls. Most importantly, we have never been disappointed with the care, concern and supervision they have over the children, which leaves us feeling assured with a peace of mind at work after we drop them off at the school.  Keep up the great work and thank you for keeping our kids safe., My son is always happy to go to school. He started attending N1 at RKI in 2018 and now he is in K2. He used to be very quiet but now he is much more outspoken and confident to share his ideas, opinion and experiences. I believe that his confidence was nurtured by the encouragement and guidance  of the teachers in school. RKI teachers are very reliable, caring, skilful and professional. Furthermore, the syllabus adopted in RKI is pretty much in line with primary school syllabus. My son also enjoys the hands-on experiences such as Montessori English and Math actives, Science experiments, cookery sessions, etc... Overall, RKI is a good pre-school which makes children grow holistically., We enrolled our daughter at RK @BP when she was 21 months old. She barely spoke a few words then and a year later she has shown tremendous improvement in speech and vocabulary. Activities conducted in school are quite impressive like tie dye, water play, cooking class and the likes. Our daughter loves going to school and teachers have been quite helpful and responsive in taking care of the tots  during the pandemic period. The in school app has brought communication quite easy and fast. Teacher Geraldine requires a special mention in being passionate and supportive in taking care of our daughter. We are quite grateful for her and all other teachers at school. Keep up the good work!, Our son has been enrolled at Raffleskidz for 8 months now. Teachers genuinely care for the children and the activities are varied and fun, including tie dye shirts, festive celebrations, paint shooting to science experiments, phonics, and fun physical activities and dance. Our son certainly benefitted from school and kudos to the teachers for their patience in getting our son to wear his mask and correct certain habits. The staff are great and we are most thankful to them for taking such good care of our child!, Enrolled my daughter with RKI @ BP when she was around 21 mths old and it was one of the best decision ever. We like the school curriculum and how the kids are engaged in class.  My little girl has became more confident in these 10 mths she has been with RKI and we can see that she express herself a lot better now (; also becoming more independent each day! Big credits to her Teachers who are so patient, supportive, assuring and nice since Day 1. Also extremely impressed with the electronic Comm book app which makes communication super fuss free, Teachers are also very responsive to our queries and gives frequent updates on our child progress through the app and monthly newsletter!  Keep up the good work RKI! (:, Thank you raffles kidz school to provide a truly outstanding place for my children. I believe all the teachers are passion and dedication for teaching is praiseworthy.  Thanks for being a good mentor for my children as well. To guild them always motivated and inspired to do great things by great teachers like you. Thanks for inspiring my son, his confidence level has increased manifold. Indeed, it has shaped greatness into our child, more than we could have imagined.  Thank you and best regards, Hangyuu & YuuJae Mommy, This school was chosen over the few others when I was ""shopping"" for a school for my son. Chose this school because of its spaciousness and its own outdoor play area.  My son started attending the school when he was about 19 months old. The teachers there helped him settle down into the daily routines quickly and managed to calm him down whenever he cried for me (my son is a mummy's boy).  Now in his second year, my boy grows fonder of the school and he enjoys going to school every day. He especially enjoys Art and Gourmet Chef (cookery) lessons as well as outdoor fitness lessons/ playtime.  The teachers in the school are polite, patient, caring and dedicated. They also provide timely updates so that parents can work together with the teachers on the development of the child.  As a parent, I particularly like the fact that we are able to view check in/ check out process and some of the ""moments"" shared through the app that was launched this year., Very thankful for the group of wonderful and patient teachers/staff in Raffles Kidz Bukit Panjang who helped our overly shy and wary girl adapt to school. They were very supportive and reassuring. They gave us frequent updates via the app at least 3 times a day for the beginning with photos which helped with the separation anxiety that us parents experienced too! :D  And they were willing to try different methods as suggested by the parents to help with the transition. My girl now goes to school with so much confidence and we could really see a difference in her development! Many thumbs up for Teacher Lina and Chen Laoshi, and all the others who cared for our girl! :), Was attracted to the school when they launchd the mini cycling track within the school compound. I also liked the fact that they have 2 buildings and 1 big playground. That provides more space for the children to learn and play.  We transferred our boy over from another childcare center. The teachers were patient and accommodating and that helped him to settle in rather well. We have also enrolled our daughter in and the teachers have been very patient and supportive of her.  The launch of the app was very beneficial for parents as we can input into the app comm book any queries that we have. And usually the teachers reply within the day itself. I also like the function 'moment' in the app where teachers will take snapshot of what our own kid is doing in class.  Currently the curriculum is moving into montessori approach and instead of changing learning theme monthly, it will be quarterly. Personally I like as this will allow the children to learn more in depth of the theme or topic which they are learning.  I enjoy reading the monthly newsletters as it provides me a glimpse of what my children have learnt in the previous month and will be learning in the following month. I would say teacher turnover rate is low. We saw about 3 teachers leaving for the past one year.  On the whole we are pleased with what the management is doing and definitely hope they will continue to do their best to provide our children with the best learning experiences =), RKI has a team of very dedicated and attentive teachers. A special shout-out to the PN teachers - Teacher Geri, Meiyu Laoshi and assistant teachers for being extremely patient and going the extra mile for the children to make their lessons fun and time in school enjoyable. They are also very prompt and communicative with updates, making our child‚Äôs first experience in RKI extremely positive! Keep it up!, My son is a student with RKI since he was 18 months old. The teachers in RKI were all attentive, dedicated, and committed in ensuring my son feels safe, happy and cared for. I am very grateful for all that they have done for my son, especially when I had my down time, and during moments he threw his tantrum and cried badly! The teachers were all reassuring and never fail to attend to my concerns. Now, I cannot wait for my daughter to join him in RKI! Thank you so much teachers, you know who you are. :)  additionally, I have also recommended RKI to my sister and her son is thriving very well!, We sent our little one to RAffles Kidz since he was 2 years old. We like this school's environment very much, especially the nice outdoor playground. Teachers in that school are patient and supportive, always update information by school's app. My kid told me, teachers told them should love others, support friends when their need help, these words are really touched me., One of the 4 centres that belongs to a premium pre-school brand which offer quality and innovative learning environment for your kids. You can be ensure that conscientious and well-trained educators will take good care of the children. My child always enjoy going to school. This school was comprised of two landed houses with quality facilities and a private children playground. However, they usually innovate the place to make it a better place if needed. The best part is the tuition fee is really reasonable in comparison with other private  pre-schools in Singapore. Highly recommended., I enrolled my girl to RafflesKids@Bukit Panjang on a full-day program since she was 18 months. She is turning 3 in 2 more months. It has been a pleasant experience since then.  During the first month, Teachers would provide updates on my girl every now and then, took photos of her and informed us of any problem or suggestion. The Teachers are responsible, always patient to answer questions and open to suggestions. They are proactive and prompt in informing us on the wellbeing of my girl.  Along the way, we are so impressed by the amount of effort that the school put in in preparing teaching materials. For instance, a close to real size milk cow prop for the kids to experience milking. The school adopts thematic teaching and during that month it was about dairy products. Every term, we are informed of the meals menu too. From the food selection, we are again assured that our kids are being well taken care of. The teachers have also done a fantastic job in toilet training. It is really stressless for us parents! The kids are taught useful skills e.g. understand traffic light, road crossing, safety at home etc as young as 2 years old. Parents are informed of learning progress via the monthly bulletin written in bilingual.  The school also uses mobile app to maintain comms with parents, including announcement and when kids check in and out of the School with photo evidence. There is also a memory section for Teachers to take precious photos of our child and upload it on the App for our viewing. As a working Mum, bonding time with child can be very limited. Those photos really mean a lot to me at least I get to somehow witness how my child performs in school during my absence.  There is an outdoor playground within the school compound. We recognise how important it is for the kids to have space to run around! In fact we are so lucky to have this school near to where we stay in Bukit Panjang. I could see majority of the childcare or preschools here only have indoor facilities.  In terms of infection control, I would give 2 thumbs ups. The check is strict and thorough. It‚Äôs also worth noting that the school engages certified cleaning and sanitization service when needed. Overall, no regrets, I highly recommend RafflesKids!, My boy has been in Raffles kidz since he was a baby and we saw the school transform into what it is now when the current management took over from Cherie Hearts 4 years ago. I must say that a lot of effort has been put in to improve the infrastructure and bring in great teachers. My boy really enjoys going to school and I am sure he will miss his Teachers and friends dearly when he goes to P1 in two years time., Rk has very dedicated staff and teachers! My eldest one has completed her preschool years with RK bukit panjang. Kudos to all the teachers for their selfless teaching and guidance. The kids in their group all grow up happily together üòäüòä ‚Ä¶, All 3 of my children goes to RKI @ BP once they hit 18mths old. I think that in itself, says alot about the school, and how much the children and us (parents) like it.  At first, I was attracted to the school, the space, the facilities and programs. The teachers are very responsive, patient, and professional as well. Teachers to student ratios are always within recommended limits, and sometimes higher ratio for younger age groups.  Pre-covid programs/activities included water play, hands-on cookery, excursions, family days, CNY, moon cake festival etc.  School approach focuses more on learning through play + manipulatives to achieve age appropriate goals. I like that they break children into smaller focus groups to practice concepts, which is great for children to have more attention from teachers. Older children build a good foundation for primary school.  All in all, a school i would recommend to family and friends who are looking for a good preschool in the vicinity.  Only downside is that there's no sheltered walkway from the nearest bus stop, making it a logistical challenge on rainy days for family without cars., the kids are having an enjoyable time  and always looking forward to school.  teachers and vp of the sch are always ready to help and show great commitment to the kids. updates are constantly being loaded into the sch app which allows the parents to understand what the kids are learning.  will surely recommend RKI@BP to anyone who is considering presch for their kids.  Keep it up RKI@BP!, When we were scouting for a school due to a relocation (pre-covid), I was specifically looking for a school that had the same momentum as the pervious school my daughter was studying.  We were looking to register her for her K1. We had gone thru at least 3 tours in that week and the last one was Raffles Kids International Bukit Panjang. As soon as we entered, there was an assurance and warm response from the teachers (Teacher Zelle) and the principal (Dianne). We registered on the spot without hesitant.  And it is worth mentioning that the momentum never ceased all thru her education in this school and even thru the pandemic. All teachers have presented the same pace throughout and they held the space and place in tact to ensure all children and their families are safe. These are highly appreciated. And our daughter calls them heroes of the school. :), One of the best decisions we have made for our first child . He attended school when he was 26months, one thing that we noticed, he is always happy to go to school Everyday ! That itself speaks volume and the dedicadion / effort that the Principal and Teachers are putting in. We all know the draggy feeling or when the little ones cry out loud not wanting to change to into their school uniform, let alone go to school.  Teachers are always caring / courteous and smiling, the vibes and feeling given to the little school goers are right and happy mood before they even started class/lessons. Teachers are well qualified and knowledgeable (billingual).  Facilities wise , was one of our criteria as , they have their own play area / garden / playground (under the sun) within their compound (fenced), other schools are utilising public playgrounds etc so security and germs was one of our main priority . And the school will always try to organise activity or events to involve the whole family . Def will recommend anyone looking for a preschool to choose RK(BP), My son started attending Raffles Kidz 5 months ago and he loves all the teachers. Everyday we find out something new he has learned and he is always happy when we pick him up. Such a wonderful school üëçüëçüëç ‚Ä¶, This is a private child care centre which has its own outdoor play area. The dining area resides at the back of the two terrace houses that the school occupies (divider wall torn down) and the children won't be in aircon all day long (personally likes this as this lowers the chances of viruses being spread easily - as compared to being in aircon all day). The children will dine in their respective classrooms during periods such as haze.  Children are grouped into the various levels e.g. Pre-nursery & N1, N2, K1 & K2 and placed into different parts of the two terraces (classrooms). I like this arrangement so that the contact between children is minimized (apart for morning assembly and after 5pm) and this would minimize the spreading of virus too.  The teachers are patient and nice. I like how updates are provided to parents promptly so that teachers and parents could work with each other for the children's development.  The launch of the school app this year was one of the best improvements. With this app, we get updates when our children checked in and out of school and also communication is made easier between the school and parents. We are also updated via the app on our children's development.  The school made some changes to the curriculum from this quarter, introducing Montessori-style type of teaching. Hope to see greater improvement to our child's learning with this change.  We have seen great process and development in our child from the start last year. Would recommend for parents to place their children in the school. ‚ó°Ãà, We started sending our little one to RKI@Bt Pjg when he turned 31 months. The school was under renovation at that time but we saw much potential from it and was also attracted by the lovely outdoor play area. One of the practices unique to the school was they didn‚Äôt allow parents‚Äô accompaniment even on the first day. We felt really unsettled with this restriction but with the teachers assuring us how successful it had been with other children we decided to give it a try. Turned out it worked well with our child. We were especially fond of the Comm Book feature in the app on which you can communicate with the teachers directly. During the first two weeks, the attending teachers have been dedicatedly updating us with pictures and progress which gave us lots of relief. Another thing we really like from the operation aspect is, they observe stringent pupil+parent/authorised personnel check-in/check-out procedures. Although it seemed a little cumbersome, we don‚Äôt mind going through it knowing that the security of the school would never be compromised. What would be perfect is for the school to be openly showing how the curriculum is conducted. Given that our child is not yet descriptive about the activities in school, we could only depend on the weekly updates to visualise the bits and pieces of it. Although our child comes back happy and is not resistant of school everyday, we hope there could be some reasonable platforms for us to see the how the curriculum is conducted., My son join RKI Bukit Panjang beginning this year and  during these eleven months, he had shown tremendous improvement in areas like speech, colouring and buliding blocks etc. He is able to communicate with people in proper full sentence. i think the ""Show & Tell"" influence him alot and the pictures shared by the teachers is worth a thousand words., Our boy transferred over during the circuit breaker period. Thanks to the teachers and staffs, the transition was smooth and he adapted to the environment quickly. He enjoys going to school and likes playing with his teachers and friends. Thank you for taking good care of our child!, Nice school and with the new app, parents can see checkin checkout picture, daily temperature, announcement, and communicate with the teachers. the teacher are always nice and responsive.  We choose the school also because it's a landed house with a small outdoor playground, and temperature is not very low inside the room.  The school is already very popular need to check whether have vacancy., My child had a wonderful and fulfilling time during his 4 years in Bukit Panjang Raffles Kidz. Thanks to his amazing teachers, he grow and learn well., Both of my sons are enrolled at RKI, they enjoyed going to school and they have alot of fun learning while playing in school.  The teachers are responsive and attentive to the needs of the sons., Love the huge playground within the school‚Äôs compound! My children love playtime there! RI BP‚Äôs teachers are also always so friendly and helpful!, The interior of the buildings are recently renovated and they have a nice playground within their grounds.  The teachers all have very positive attitude, care and patience towards the kids., My sons has been with Raffles kids for two years and they have a wonderful time there, thanks for the teachers @ Bukit Panjang to taking good care or them., Childcare teachers have been nothing short of amazing, with the patience and amount of love they have for the children., Great school for my little ones to grow and develop their learning skills, The best child care in Sg, highly recommended, Great school for kids to start with!, Nice place for young kids to play and learn, Best childcare, my eldest (now p3) attended and graduated from RKI and had a great issue transitioning into primary school. so I wrote in to BP RKI school and management about my concern hoping that they could attend to my concern as my younger 2 children are also enrolled into the RKI BP.  to my dismay, they did not respond to my mail and they also did not provide me with a good and honest feedback about my child's academics. my 2nd child was in k1 last year but was not doing well in her phonics and this was not raised during PTM- I was only informed that my child was doing well and same par as her classmates. but when we attend classes outside of RKI, her standard was significantly lower than her peers.  not only that, they increased their price without valid justification. when concern is raised, no response or acknowledgement was given. so had to make a hard decision to withdraw my children (going to K2 and N2 in 2024) which was a really hard choice for my K2.  my children had become more vocal and independent after attending the new school (which is cheaper than RKI) for only 2 months, and they can actually come home to tell me in details on the plenty of events what they had done in school for the day. which was a vast difference compared to how they were in RKI. it seemed like they practically did nothing for the day when they were in RKI.  for the price that RKI is charging , I'm expecting them to be able to deliver results in my child's holistic growth. but sadly it seems like I had hindered my children growth and made it more difficult for them to transition to primary 1 by sending them to RKI., Children who were not good at speaking Korean successfully graduated from this kindergarten and went on to elementary school. At first, the children had a lot of trouble with English and Chinese, but looking back, I think it was an excellent choice. The teachers were friendly and I was satisfied with the overall curriculum, including English/Chinese/mathematics."
Raffles Kidz @ Punggol √¢¬Ä¬ì Best Childcare Centre and Preschool,"NEW review (Dec 2023)  Another year has passed.  Our daughter continues to be showered with love, care and support by the staff members at Raffles Kidz @ Punggol.  Special shoutouts to Principal Angie, Deputy District Manager Esther, Liu Laoshi and Teacher Ting.  The K2 graduation ceremony and end of year concert was so memorable that our daughter continues to dance to the beat till date.  Thank you sincerely for another successful year! ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- PREVIOUS review (2022)  We sent our daughter to Raffleskidz @ Punggol beginning of December.  While we didn‚Äôt know what to expect as first time parents, Gwen (Principal) and her team of staff members had kept us informed every step of the way.  The daily updates from the school, in the form of text and pictures, on our daughter during the first few weeks have put us at ease.  Special shoutout to Ting Laoshi, Teacher Nabillah, Teacher Sankare, Yan Laoshi and Chen Laoshi.  We appreciate the open communication and transparency of Raffleskidz which have given us the confidence to continue putting our daughter in school during the challenging times of Covid.  Gwen, as the Principal, is heavily involved in the operations of the school.  That‚Äôs just remarkable and admirable.  Thank you Raffleskidz @ Punggol for looking after our kids and their parents in a way!, We love the facilities and layout of the school. The compound is always kept clean and neat. However, it‚Äôs the dedication and patience of the teachers and staff members which we are most appreciative of. Seeing our son go to school happy and making many friends is a joy for us parents.  Thank you teacher Geri, ÈÇ¢ËÄÅÂ∏à, Yumi ËÄÅÂ∏à and the rest of the Raffles Kidz staff members for not only giving our son a solid start in education but also a childhood to remember :), I couldn't be happier with our experience at Raffles Kidz Punggol! Our child had a difficult start at another school, but after just six months here she not only adapted beautifully but have also blossomed into a confident little learner.  The teachers go above and beyond to keep parents in the loop, providing regular updates and insights into our child's progress. This level of involvement has put our minds at ease.  The nurturing environment and dedicated teachers have worked wonders for our little one's confidence and emotional well-being. Seeing her walk into school with a smile on her face is a testament to the supportive atmosphere that this preschool provides.  We're truly grateful for this positive experience and would wholeheartedly recommend this preschool to any parent seeking a warm, caring, and effective early learning environment for their child., I wanted to express my heartfelt gratitude for the wonderful Mid-Autumn celebration at Raffles Kidz. It was truly an enjoyable evening, and I could see the dedication and hard work put in by the teachers to make this event a success.  Moreover, I wanted to take a moment to appreciate all the teachers for their guidance and support in my child's journey. They have truly transformed her from a shy, apprehensive baby into a confident and self-assured child. The progress is evident in her ability to stand up and perform in front of everyone.  Additionally, I'd like to extend my thanks for the excellent transition into primary school for my older child who graduated from Raffles Kidz. The seamless shift is a testament to the quality of education and care provided by the teachers. Thank you, Raffles Kidz, for nurturing and guiding both of my children in such a positive way., Thankful for Raffleskidz  education system and syllabus that my son is doing very well academically for a 5 years old. He is able to do subtraction of big numbers and learning about thousands. The Montessori approach maths helps him to archive what is needed in primary school. His English and Chinese is also getting on pretty well. My son finally willing to converse with me in Chinese too. The school provide a safe place and enjoyable time for my son on an everyday basis. He respect his teacher a lot as they are very gentle with him. He get to learn cookery too. The school bus option made logistic matters so much better. Grateful for the option., My boy attended RKI Punggol for 7months, before we transferred to the YCK centre. We had a good experience here, the teachers are really warm to the kids and they showered him with so much love, especially Tr Serene, previous Chen Lao shi and Hu Lao shi. The centre is also very clean and neat and had ample outdoor play area with their own playground. Would recommend this centre! Hope they YCK centre is as good :), I sent both my kids to Raffles Kids Punggol. My kids love their teachers and look forward going to school every morning. The overall experience for us as parents is beyond our expectation, we can feel how caring and passionate the teachers there are, naturally motivated from love. We are thankful for teachers at Raffles Kids for enabling our kids to be the best of themselves. We believe the suitable early education the kids received, the teachers and curriculum they are experiencing and the schoolmates they grow up with would be one of the most influential part of their lives. A big thanks to all staffs in Raffles Kids @Punggol, and wish the school a bright future., My girl joined Raffles Kidz @ Punggol in 2022 as a K1 kid. Initially it worried me a little, whether she would adapt well or enjoy her new school‚Ä¶ The teachers were very patient and dedicated in helping her to adjust and adapt very quickly. She looks forward to going to school everyday. Teachers would greet us every morning with a chirpy tone, and consistently update us on our child‚Äôs progress. In these 2 years, she has become more confident in speaking, and will always share with us her experiences and knowledge learnt in school. From not knowing how to speak Mandarin, my girl is now conversing with us in Mandarin at home. She looks forward to having her Spellings & Âê¨ÂÜôs every week, which really helped prep her for P1! We have definitely noticed a significant improvement and her keen in learning academically. Very glad with my decision to enrol her with RKI @ Punggol, and so thankful to the teachers (& all her wonderful friends) who have been there with her through this amazing journey. :), Teachers kept close communication with parents and caregivers on child's progress and behaviours in school. They are open to feedback and would address any concerns brought up professionally. More importantly my child enjoys her time at Raffles Kidz and I have seen how she has became more eager about sharing her time in school with us at the end of the school day after joining the centre., We sent our daughter to Raffles Kidz @ Punggol since Pre Nursery class in late 2021.  She‚Äôs now enjoying herself very much at Nursery 1 class and building great relationships with her classmates, especially a few exactly same age as her. Big kudos to both Liu Laoshi (Chinese teacher) and Teacher Ting (English teacher) for their continued love, care and support toward everyone. We can feel the genuine care from every teacher, and of course Principal Esther, in our interactions. RKI is truly a place where kids could learn with fun, experience with happiness, and develop key milestone skills in encouraging and cheerful environments., Very nice environment and school.  Teachers are accommodating and patience with my child. My son loves all his teachers and loves school.  Thank you teachers for being so dedicated towards your job in order to make sure the children are save in your hand.  Happy teachers day to all teachers in raffles kidz@punggol., Great teachers but BAD management. Under staffs and failed to deliver what was promised to parents. 3 principals change and multiple teachers changes in less than 2 years. I don't understand why they are still opening new outlets when they are under staffs, and affecting the CURRENT student. Very disappointing; it's getting worst., In 2018, it was our hard decision to send our only son to childcare at 20 months old. We found RKI Punggol and selected this school, believing that our son Haemil will be in good hands. RKI school is a professional preschool and childcare, on what the claim. The program is an excellently balanced work-play schedule, teaching in bilingual, English, and Chinese. As a result, Haemil is always happy coming to school and enjoys his time with teachers and classmates. (And most of the time, he doesn't want to go home). He joined RKI Punggol from PG to K2 (10.12.2022 graduation day). We can see good development in him from year to year. The environment is essential in molding a child's attitude and behavior. A good school with a pleasant atmosphere, professional teachers, and high-standard management must be considered when selecting a preschool for your beloved one. Although I often travel abroad for work, I never worry and often see the updated activities from school apps. RKI constantly improves school programs, which are innovative for new activities, increasing child's exploration. All RKI kids are unique; they grow up well, are intelligent, love each other, and always be happy with their interests.  Furthermore, the RKI team always listens to the feedback and is transparent with the parent, improving to a higher standard each year. They also did very well during the crisis of Covid 19. We appreciated and thumbed up for the team. (from management, principal, teachers/laoshi, cleaners, and cookers).  My husband and I appreciate your care for the past five years. We thank you for being a good part of his growth from a baby to a boy: Principal Gwen, Yu Laoshi, Tr Emily, and his past teachers: Liu Laoshi, Tr Raye, Tr Jo, Tr Amina, and Han Laosi. (Also, special thanks for his Laoshi; Haemil never communicates in Chinese at home because his mummy is Thai. He learned Chinese purely from school, has very high discipline in learning Chinese, and finally, he can give a Chinese speech on graduation day!), We love raffles kids üíó. My daughter and son have spend an unforgettable time with this school. Lovely teachers, friendly staffs, and high-standard hygiene environment. They provided great childcare service and good curriculum. Highly recommended. ‚Ä¶, It's been great years with Raffles Kidz at Punggol. Teachers are so devoted to give children the best.. my both kids love their friends and teachers there. Personally i like the School environment which is indoor and outdoor while maintaining the cleanliness.. For academic, I think Montessori suits children very well. All in all, as long child is healthy and happy teachers are kind and loving, I think I am settled., My kid transfer to this school during his N2 period. He likes the new school so much ! Teachers are responsible and cheerful! He improved a lot in Chinese ( before that never learned Chinese) , mathematics and English speech. Also , gained alot new skills ,even in cooking ! That‚Äôs very lovely when he show us how to make cake , dumplings or even sandwiches! The Teachers are observant , and real talented to teach kids in many ways . My kid enjoyed a lot here. This school was highly recommended by my friends to me . Now , I‚Äôd like to recommend Raffle Kids International to all the mummy and daddy who‚Äôs seeking a Happy Good school ., Happy to have found Raffles Kidz @Punggol . We have seen great improvements in my son's enthusiasm for learning and he has picked up many social skills as well. Thanks very much to Xiong Laoshi and Teacher Jan as they are really patient, attentive and proactive communicate with parents with helpful feedbacks. I have reserved next year slot for my little girl in RK Punggol too! ‚ù§, My son has been attending RKI@punggol for about 2 years now and our experience have always been good. Thank you for the frequent updates from the teachers and our principal Ms. Lynda. I can get to know how my child is progressing and the area that he needs more attention. They have been working very hard everyday to care and to educate our children the same time. Thank you so much for all your love. Keep up the good work!, We are happy with our choice of Raffles Kidz @ Punggol as the preschool for our daughter and seen improvements since she started attending Raffles Kidz Preschool. Teachers are dedicated , creative , caring and encouraging. Thanks you to the principle. teachers , assistant teachers and helpers in school for helping to create a wonderful learning environment especially during Covid- 19 and well taken care of her !We couldn't thank you all enough!, Our daughter started attending Playground at Raffles Kidz @ Punggol since Dec 2021 and it hasnt been easy for her with this new routine and change of environment, on top of learning to cope with separation anxiety just like most kids do. However my wife and I are grateful and want to take this opportunity to thank the Principal and teachers at Raffles Kidz for their patience and guidance in making this transition as gentle as possible for her! Gwen, the Principal has been a very hands on Principal. She truly takes time to know the kids in school and to understand their needs and unique character. The teachers are all so patient, positive and kind towards her. She may not like the daily drop-offs but she certainly is enjoying school once she settle down in class. Not only so, we noticed the change in her, how she has blossomed in her own time, and impressing us with all the new stuff she learned in school! Once again, thank you to the team at Raffles Kidz @ Punggol!, RK - Punggol has a very good facility with outdoor play areas. It provides a conducive learning environment which allows more hands-on activities for my child's learning progression and growth.  He clearly enjoyed his morning workouts, cooking lessons and being with his friends.  Special thanks to Teacher Kat for being very engaging and professional.  It is great that the school emphasized on Mandarin language as one of the core-curriculum.  A short distance from our home as well, hence no doubt RK-Punggol was an ideal school of choice., My daughter joined Raffles Kidz @ Punggol mid-way through the school term after returning from abroad. We choose RKI because we wanted to ensure that she enters an academic focus foster environment, and we are glad we made the right choice. With the support and close communication from the Teachers and Principal, she settled in very quickly to her class. They encourage and cherish her accomplishment as she progresses, and tailored school materials based on her development level and the areas she needed improvement in. Beyond academic, I am also thankful that her social and emotional health are well taken care of. After a couple of months with RKI, the initial struggle and refusal to attend school were long gone. The staff of RKI have certainly done a phenomenal job in providing a nurturing and learning experience., We have enrolled our child (Pre-Nursery) since Jan 2022 and it has been a great journey. The Principal (Gwen) and Teachers were great and there was clear and open conversation throughout. It took our child about 2 weeks to settle in and soon, going to school was no longer a chore. If you child asks to go to school, you know the school must be doing something right. We also like that there is a playground within the school compound and an area to play with 'cars and bikes'. They also practice quite a bit of common sense and allow snacks to be packed for your child if you have a later pick up time.  The teachers were engaging, enthusiastic, friendly and most importantly, able to build rapport with our child quickly. This helped to ease our initial concerns and worries. Whatever our queries, we just had to input it into the e-commsbook and it would be usually answered within a day. Photos were also sent there although we would have loved more photos (what is enough is subjective though üò¨).  The curriculum has a good mix of outdoor and indoor play. We see quite a bit of arts and craft and hands on experiential learning. We can also see them trying to teach numbers and alphabets. But frankly at this age, we are just happy that she wants to go to school. There were also small thoughtful gestures like rinsing the milk bottles after use so that we will have an easier time cleaning later. A smaller centre also means a little less falling sick and more attention on your child.  The only downside is the centre's location in the middle of a private estate so when it rains, it can get quite difficult. The closest LRT station is Punggol Point and it is about a 10 mins walk in. Road closures around the Punggol Road area also means you can only access the centre by Punggol Way (Northshore).  So in summary, no complaints or issues with the school thus far. We love the passionate and caring teachers.  PS: Special shout outs to Teachers Sankare, Chen Laoshi, Serene, Kat, Yumi, Liu/Yan/Mao Laoshi, Siti, Nabillah, all whom our child often mention at home. Thank you for rendering great care to our child!, Our 2.5 yrs old girls have been with RKI for almost 9 months now, so it's about time to share our thoughts!  All their teachers are very friendly and helpful, even when they aren't their class teachers. Our girls look forward to school everyday and they often comment on the teachers helping them with this and that, and they always come home happy telling us about their indoor and outdoor (playground) activities in school. Because the school teaches in both English and Mandarin, both of them are becoming more proficient in speaking Mandarin and takes the initiative to speak in Mandarin too. They would also bring home handmade art and craft pieces. Class teachers constantly give feedback on their learning progress too, either face to face or via the app.  We would strongly recommend RKI to all parents looking for a reputable, bilingual preschool for their children., My daughter has been with RKI Punggol for close to 2 years. We are happy with the school and the interaction with the teachers. There is continuous update on the child and teachers are very receptive to the feedback provided to them. We like the different activities organised which keeps the kids happy and eager to go to school. RKI was the best decision for our girl. We want to thank all the teachers and Principal Ms Lynda for the love, care and guidance provided to our child. üíï, We knew we made the right choice to transfer our girl to Raffles Kidz @ Punggol when we saw her difference in just 4 months. There were great improvement in her fine motor, language and social skills. Teacher Nabillah and Liu Laoshi have been very patient and dedicated. Now we have enrolled our younger child for their pre-nursery class!, Happy to find Raffles Kidz @Punggol. We have seen a great increase in my son's enthusiasm for learning and he has also acquired many social skills. Many thanks to Teacher Liu Jie and Teacher Anne, who are very patient, careful and proactive in communicating with parents and providing helpful feedback, My boy just joined his sister in school this year. We have been very concerned on his learning journey as he is slower compared to the kids of the same age. Knowing our concerns, the teachers of his class have been very helpful and feedback on his progress. We are so glad to enrol our kids in Raffles Kidz., My son have been with RKI since 20months old. He is now in his Nursery 2 and teachers here are all so caring and cheerful. I really feel at eased when he is in school. This is really important for working mums like me, teachers give regular updates and send pics of my son's school life. As parents, we really need regular updates of what they do in school. I strongly recommend RKI as the preschool of choice!, Our 4 year old son has been at Raffles Kidz@Punggol since he was 18 months old. It has been a rewarding learning experience for him and us as parents. The team of teachers and staff maintain an open communication channel and this forms a better bridge of understanding of our child's learning journey. We feel most comforted and thankful when he greets us with smiles and hugs after school. We are glad that we enrolled our son in this pre-school., I am thankful to teacher Kat and teacher Mi Yu. My daughter started opening up and being the cheerful girl she is now after she met teacher Kat and Teacher MI Yu. Teachers are so enthusiastic and responsible. I feel that positive vibe whenever I talk to them. Highly recommend the school., We like the relatively private location of the school. The recently renovated centre offers a lot of privacy, making it difficult for strangers to see anything from outside. Teachers were friendly and caring and always seemed very cheerful each time we dropped and picked our kids up. Photo updates can be lacking with only one photo weekly. However, upon request, they were prompt to send updates, assuring you., My daughter has been in RKI Punggol for more than a year since pre-nursery days. Step by step i have seen her progress to become more independent and practising the things that she learnt in school. The teachers have been very patient and nurturing. Everytime there is a special occasion or an open day i can see in all their decorations and preparation the massive effort that has been put into making it a perfect experience for both parents and children. That can only be possible with a strong comaraderie  from leadership to staff. RKI is a great place to send your child for a holistic, balanced bilingual education , placed on right values, imparted by loving teachers. ‚ù§Ô∏è, Really pleased and impressed with the way the sch handles the kids. The cleanliness, the way the sch handles young kids with covid, the teachers‚Äô patience is really top notch. Not to forget the Principal Gwen, who‚Äôs very experienced and hands on. Really recommend any parents who‚Äôs looking for a pre-sch for their young kids. Also kudos to Teacher Sankare & Teacher Yan, Our daughter has been with RafflezKidz for about 2.5 years. We've seen really good growth in her in these years. The teachers are very open and partner with us well for the overall growth of the child.  The daily updates through the app helps to keeps us updated.  We're glad that we chose RafflezKidz for our daughter, We enrolled our child since she was 18mth old till 4years old. Best decision that we have ever made in enrolling her to the school! Teacher to students ratio was considered comfortable. The teachers are attentive and quick to update on things. And I adore most on how the teachers care for each child. The school principal also took time to know all the children. It's amazing how they can remember little bits of each child's character and behaviour. The effort in getting parents involve in the children school activities are also commendable as they are always very encouraging. Environment of the school was accessible via public. School curriculum includes outdoor play almost every other depending on weather, which was wonderful because we love our child to play more outdoors. They also include waterplay and cookery lessons which our daughter enjoy immensely. The have quite abit of excursions for the children that do not requires parents to take time off. I guess as working parents, although it wud have been lovely to be there to experience the journey with the children, it was nice not being pressured to take time off from work to go through all the school trips. I understand there are schools that do not allow the child to participate out of school trips if the parents are unable to join. This is good because our child still gets to experience as much out of school education despite our working hours (mind you I do 3 shifts so this was truly appreciated by me). The only few downfalls that we experienced was deductions of school fees and costs for events and trips. We had to multiple times get bounced back and fourth between the school and the bank saying that deduction was unsuccessful despite sufficient value. Ended up paying personally at school almost every month. And the cost to attend graduation concert and some of the outdoor trips is quite steep for preschoolers. All in all, if it was not for MOE kindergarten availability in a school that is 3 minutes walk from our house, we would have continued our child to complete  her pre-school journey with Raffles Kidz Punggol., When we first enrolled, our child had a pair of passionate Teachers and the previous Principal was on the ball and you can tell the effort the team puts in. But in 2021, returning after the first wave of covid, we noticed our child‚Äôs changed behaviour towards school. The melt down and rejection towards school became more intense. And we noticed that there were lesser books read and the curriculum has been reduced. The new principal‚Äôs responses lack lustre and flippant. And it‚Äôs obvious our child has been watching screens in school to fill time. Not worth your penny for the lack of activities, child engagement and even basic update from teacher was not frequent enough. Better off sending your child to Govt affiliated pre schools which has more curriculum planning. Or go for other preschools with higher fees but smaller ratio and a qualified principal., Thank you Raffles Kidz Punggol all of the teachers and staffs for organising such an awesome graduation ceremony! It is such a touching moment to see our kid grow so well with Raffles Kidz, My boy has been attending raffles kidz since 2 years old now already 5 years old.Both we love this school! The teachers are so patient and kind, i can tell they have a passion for what they do and it shows. Thank you all., The Teachers are responsive to parents query. Many fun activities were planned for he kids. The syllabus is just as strong. A very well balanced pre-school., A school with dedicated teachers with well structure lessons. My child has developed a lot since starting to attend this school since 18 mths, definitely recommend this school to every parent., All my 3 kids are in RKI Punggol branch. Love the teachers there, responsible, loving and passionate towards the children., Love the school and teachers!  My girl been there since pre nursery and she looks forward to school everyday. Kudos to all the teachers !, My kid enjoy going to school everyday., Extremely passionate team of teachers.. both our girls are blessed to have had their childhood education with Raffles Kidz!, Both of my kids are attending this school,All teachers are very nice and passion., Very good for kids. Teachers are nice and friendly. Nice The facility, A great school to send your kids for their early development education, Excellent teaching staff, clean campus, my son and I will miss the school and teachers dearly!, Nice place to learn and enjoy with other kids!!, Good environment...nice place, Good for kids, Good place"
Raffles Kidz @ Yio Chu Kang,"Two years ago, we made the decision to transfer our child from another preschool to Raffles kidz, and it's a choice we've never regretted. The school environment, curriculum, and teachers have been nothing short of exceptional. Despite the ongoing challenges posed by staff turnover in the industry, the school has adeptly navigated these transitions while still ensuring that the children have a fulfilling and enjoyable time at school. We greatly appreciate the spacious outdoor area. It's all been worth it. We wholeheartedly recommend Raffles Kidz to any parents seeking peace of mind for their children's care and comprehensive early education., I cannot express enough how delighted me and my wife are with our decision to enroll both our sons, Lukas and Markas, at Raffles Kidz Pre-School. From the moment we stepped through the doors, we knew we had made the right choice for their early education journey.  One of the standout qualities of Raffles Kidz Pre-School is its warm and inviting atmosphere. The staff and teachers genuinely care about the well-being and development of each child, and it's evident in the smiles on Lukas and Markas' faces every morning as they eagerly head to school. The nurturing environment fosters a sense of security that is crucial for young children, and it has made the transition to preschool a smooth and enjoyable experience for both of them.  The curriculum at Raffles Kidz Pre-School is nothing short of impressive. It strikes a perfect balance between structured learning and play-based exploration. Lukas and Markas come home every day excited to share what they've learned, from counting to storytelling, art projects to science experiments. The diverse and engaging activities not only stimulate their curiosity but also promote critical thinking and problem-solving skills.  We are equally impressed with the dedication and professionalism of the teaching staff. The teachers at Raffles Kidz Pre-School are not only highly qualified but also genuinely passionate about early childhood education. They take the time to understand each child's unique strengths and areas for growth, ensuring that Lukas and Markas receive personalized attention and support. It's heartwarming to see how well our sons have bonded with their teachers, creating a strong foundation for their educational journey.  Communication between the school and parents is exceptional. Regular updates, parent-teacher conferences, and informative newsletters keep us well-informed about our children's progress. This open line of communication has eased any concerns we might have had as parents, knowing that our children's needs are being met.  Raffles Kidz Pre-School also goes the extra mile to provide a range of extracurricular activities that complement the curriculum. From music and dance to outdoor exploration and field trips, our sons have had the opportunity to explore their interests and talents in a supportive and encouraging environment.  Safety is a top priority at Raffles Kidz Pre-School, which gives us peace of mind as parents. The school maintains rigorous safety protocols and ensures a clean and hygienic environment, especially given the challenges posed by recent events.  In summary, Raffles Kidz Pre-School has exceeded our expectations in every aspect. Lukas and Markas are thriving academically and socially, and we credit much of their development to the incredible teachers and staff at this school. We wholeheartedly recommend Raffles Kidz Pre-School to any parents seeking a nurturing, stimulating, and safe environment for their children's early education. It's a place where children truly blossom and build the foundation for a lifetime of learning., My son is about to graduate from Raffles Kindergarten üßë‚Äçüéìü§©. He is a happy, well balanced & diligent student, fully prepared for the adventures and challenges that await in Primary school... all thanks to his hard working & incredibly dedicated teachers! He has truly reached his highest potential with the help of Raffles and their excellent ciriculum and teachers. They have gone the extra mile to help him create a love for study and particularly, enjoy learning and speaking Chinese. Thank you to all the staff at YCK Raffles, who have helped my son in his education journey!, Our son joined Raffles kids @YCK when he was 18 months old. He enjoy attending school, the curriculum at YCK. The teachers have been caring and accomodation of each child's different needs. The huge in-house playground gives children ample space to expend energy and play with their friends. Thanks to all the teachers in the Raffles kids @YCK. Keep up the good work!, As parents of twins enrolled here for the past 2 years, we would like to commend the teachers for a job well done! Special shoutout to K1 teachers Tessa, Syafiqah, Zhu laoshi and Xing laoshi.  We chose the school primarily for its outdoor playground, bilingual Montessori and inquiry-based curriculum and all-encompassing activities included in a single school fee. We also like the fact Raffles Kidz is directly owned and not under a franchise model where profit generation could potentially be an equally or more important factor.  It certainly has been a fruitful and happy experience thus far. The teachers are very dedicated and constantly organize many different activities beyond academics to provide a well-rounded education for the children. We really appreciate and are grateful to the teachers in planning for activities such as all festive occasions, field trips and the annual concert, which we know often require time and effort outside the regular curriculum time. Teacher turnover has been relatively low for our kids' class (not an easy achievement in the early childhood industry) and we believe this familiarity sets a good foundation for a child's learning in their early years.  Our kids look forward going to school and we see marked improvement in their learning and social skills. In particular, the children love playing with their friends at the playground and the regular water play and cooking sessions. Kudos to the teachers and keep up the good work!, Raffles Kidz @ YCK is a conducive environment for my daughter to spend her pre-school years. The school curriculum supports bilingual education. There are also varied activities for her to learn through role playing, cookery and, arts and craft. She enjoys the large playground to play with her friends and the teachers like Teacher Syafiqah and Teacher Tessa have been so nurturing and supportive of her learning too. My daughter loves going to school every day., Right choice in entrusting son with Raffles Kids YCK. Teachers in N2 are all super caring, full of energy and shower him with lots of üíï. Curriculum are comprehensive and full of varieties which allows kids to develop and grow from academic to physical. Keep up the good work teachers! Thanks for taking good care of my little boy. ‚Ä¶, My little one started attending N1 at Raffles Kidz @ YCK since early this year and it hasnt been easy for him with this new change of environment and on top of experiencing separation anxiety just like most kids do. However I am grateful we have Teacher Trisha and Xu Laoshi are so gentle and extraordinary patient in helping him to adjust and adapt to new environment. Teacher Trisha and Xu Laoshi will communicate with us frequently how's the progress he can adapt to new environment and socialize with friends. They also gave us a lot of guidance and continuously checking how he is doing after school. Not forget to mention, the Principle and other teachers are also very helpful whenever needed. Sometimes he may not like the daily drop-offs but he certainly is enjoying school once he settled down in class. I also noticed the change in him how he socialized with friends, and impressing us with all the new stuff he learned in school! Appreciate and thankful to all staffs in Raffles Kids @ YCK, Our daughter has been engaged with school thoroughly since she enrolled in RCK YCK at the age of 18mths. She will be graduating this year and we would like to thank the passion and dedication of her teachers at the school for helping her develop into a more confident and enthusiastic learner! A special shout out to Teacher Kas, Ming Laoshi and Qi Laoshi., Excellent curriculum and enrichment, teachers who are loving to the children and go above and beyond, seriously nothing more we could ask for. Communication to parents was also very warm, clear, and personable. Truly a wonderful experience for us before we moved to a different area and sadly had to leave the school., Raffles Kidz YCK is a great place where children can start their learning journey. I have a daugther (N2) and a son (PN). I have seen vast improvement in thileir communication and motor skills. They are able to construct sentences, read words and articulate clearly . What impress me the most is my daugther is able to write her chinese name clearly and neatly. Special thanks to Teacher Sankare, Peng Lao shi (N2); Teacher Zana, Nud, Meng Lao Shi (PN). Will definitely recommend raffles kidz YCK., Amazing school with very loving teachers who put their heart into nurturing kids' love for learning and life skills (cooking and baking included!). We enrolled since kid was 20mths old and are very appreciative of how they've helped our kid to become a better version of himself.  Pedagogy & Curriculum - we were initially attracted to RKI YCK for its bilingual curriculum and large playground. but the school offers way more than that. The pedagogy encourages self-discovery through play, a love for learning, cultivating good life habits & values, and developing an inquisitive mindset. Food  - your kid will eat hearty, healthy balanced meals; way better than the typical office workers' meals. Our kid took a liking to fruits thanks to RKI YCK.  RKI YCK has a selective hiring process. They've got a great team who take the effort to design and deliver lessons that engage and stimulate the kids way better than tired parents can - by four, they're exposed to discussing current affairs, singing chinese tang poems and songs, and develop an understanding of complex concepts / events through decomposition into simpler ideas. Kid was definitely way less resistant to learning mandarin than I was at his age.  Facilities-wise - the school is clean and well maintained kudos to the hardworking support team of chefs and assistants disinfecting and cleaning up after the kids everyday. kids are not the most hygiene-conscious and it is a commendable effort keeping bugs at bay.  We like that kids get to enjoy a massive outdoor playground within the compound and continue to play together after school at the park next door. Community is great in RKI YCK and the surrounding neighborhood.  If you're driving this is the only school in the nearby estates with a private porch for drop-off. There's also a bus stop nearby., My daughter started attending school here in Dec 2021. The teachers are very caring and patient. In my opinion, this school offers a great balance of a (sufficiently) rigorous academic curriculum, as well as lots of play time and fun activities. There is a sizeable outdoor playground and water play every month., I am thrilled to provide an excellent review for the preschool and teachers who have guided and taught my daughter over the past years. From the moment we walked through the doors, we were welcomed with open arms and felt at home. The teachers are truly exceptional and have provided my daughter with a warm, supportive, and engaging learning environment.  Their patience, creativity, and dedication to their students is truly impressive and has not gone unnoticed. My daughter has grown and learned so much under their care, and I am grateful for the positive influence they have had on her development. The curriculum is well-planned and engaging, and the teachers are skilled at differentiating instruction to meet the needs of all students.  I would also like to highlight the exceptional support provided by the administration and staff. They are always available to address any concerns and are committed to providing a safe and nurturing environment for all students.  In short, I highly recommend this preschool and its dedicated teachers. Their commitment to providing a high-quality education and fostering a love of learning is truly unmatched. Thank you for all that you do!, Raffleskidz is a wonderful school for my children. My three kids grew with the enriching  curriculum and   their holistic Arts Enrichment experience. The school most certainly  deserves way more than 5 stars to be awarded. To all the Teachers, Principal and management team  in RKI Thank you for your hard work in supporting my kids as they develop. Your patience and commitment to support my children means a lot to us‚Äù ‚ÄúWith all your guidance, our children have developed into  confident and capable individuals., Enrolled my daughter at Raffleskidz YCK since January‚Äô21 and I have only great things to say about my experience. The teachers, staffs and principal are amazing and each child is treated with care. My daughter absolutely loves the school and the Teachers. She looks forward to attending school everyday. This school is home for our family. Thank you teachers for taking such great care of her., We transferred both our kids to RKI @ YCK 1 year ago; and have never regretted our choice. The environment, curriculum and teachers have been wonderful. Despite the ongoing pandemic and now the endemic, the school was able to manage the restrictions, and still allow the children have an enjoyable time in school. We love the huge outdoor space, the outdoor eating area and the stringent precautions the school take to ensure safety of the children. As with many other private schools we feel the school fees is a lil bit high with teachers attrition rate inevitability high as well. Nevertheless we trust the management decision and will still recommend RKI @ YCK to any parents who wants to have a peace in mind for their children care and holistic learning in their early years., Been to a few school tours before I finally decided to enroll my child here. What impressed me was the teachers, the environment and the curriculum. My child was 3 years old when we enrolled him and we were quite worried that he would take longer to adapt because he enrolled quite ""late"". However, he managed to settle in nicely and we were very impressed with the teachers. You can tell that the teachers are really passionate about what they do, which is very important for me. I feel that the environment is also conducive for learning and my child would share some of the interesting activities that he did in school. School is clean and airy and cleanliness is not an issue. Curricula wise, there is a balance of work and play with a good mix of extra curricula activities. The curriculum was recently reviewed to ensure a wholesome education. Highly recommended to schedule a tour with the school to find out more., Our son joined RKI@YCk when he was 18months old. For the past one and the half years, we have seen a positive progression and development in him. Now he will come home and share with us what happened in school during the day, he is also seen to be more independent. These are all hard work of all the teachers and principal.  The teachers are caring and patience towards our boy. It's really not easy teaching and caring for toddlers at their age. Appreciate each and everyone of all teaching staff at RKI@YCK., A very warm and family friendly oriented preschool. Throughout the 4 years the teachers showed their dedication and passion to guide and teach my daughter. Their relentless efforts and proactive approach plus their curriculum  gave me the assurance that my daughter is in good hands., We were recommended by a friend to this school after my son spend 6 months in another pre-school crying everyday dreading to go there. After we changed to Raffles Kidz@YCK, we can see immediate change to the attitude and behavior of my son. He stop crying after 1 week attending the new school and is because of the teachers, principal, facilities and clean environment. The teachers do a wonderful job of taking care of my son and now my son will sing songs that he learned from his teachers and friends. He also will tell us many things about his friends and what they did in the school. He really loves going to school now. Thanks to all the teachers in Raffles Kidz@YCK. Keep up the good work !!!, Both our kids attended Raffles Kidz @ YCK for a total of 6 years. The centre during pre-covid days was a bustling, warm and friendly environment not only for the children but the parents as well with the many organised activities.  COVID was a real downer as the centre could not organise anything, plus teachers naturally seemed a lot more distant. Coming out of the pandemic however, things have changed and I can see that the activities and warmth has come back.  Special shout out to Teacher Anishah and Li Laoshi for their longstanding service and having watched over our children well for so many years., Both my children age 6 & 3 has attended Raffles Kidz International since 18 mth old. They are very independent and displayed compassion and love towards the community and family.

Highly recommended YCK branch!, We are very happy with the teachers and the school. My girl and boy attends this school and they learned a lot. Lessons are in English and Chinese. Both teachers make a lot of effort in educating the children. My boy especially seemed to really like the Chinese lessons and even knows a lot of Chinese strokes in N2. English lesson follows the Montessori system. The school is in a corner landed house with a lot of space, environment is good and clean (school was fully renovated couple years ago) and my kids loved playing with their friends in there. There is an outdoor playground inside the school so there's a good balance of indoor and outdoor time. Next to the school there is also a public playground and park which kids can go after school. I recommend this school., My son is studying since N2 till K2. Teachers are very caring and attentive to all details. His social skill improved especially making friends outside. He interested in cookery as well especially making kebab üòÇ I can also see his improvement in academic as well. This year is his last year in RKI. He will surely miss his friends and all teachers. Thank you for all the care and love., The Teachers at Raffles Kidz YCK are very professional and passionate to the children. Our son started school 6 months ago and loves all the Teachers and school curriculums. He‚Äôs always looking forward to school everyday. We are very grateful that the Teachers are always on a look out for him, especially during his transition to be a big brother. Also, the school is newly renovated, beautiful and clean! Highly recommend for parents who are looking for a school around YCK area!, If you are looking for a school where your child receives lots of TLC and nurturance, Raffles Kidz@ Yio Chu Kang is a good place to be!

In the 5 months that our kid has been with them, we have seen lots of positive growth and development in him.  The teachers show genuine passion, commitment and interest in teaching and caring for the kids.  In addition to that, the staff shows a lot of empathy towards us as parents sending our kid to school for the first time, and they are always ready to address any concerns we have about how our kid is acclimatising to a new environment and care-givers.  Our kid is very happy, and we cannot be happier!  We have been extremely pleased with our decision to enroll our kid in Raffles Kidz International YCK!, Excellent and fabulous school enable the focus on both academic, arts, and physical activities.  My boy was with RKI  YCK for 3 years till date, he is now in K2 class. We love to see his progress, development and changes along the years with RKI.

They are able to manage and shape the kids behaviours, improve kids learning progress and provide timely feedback to parents and enable two way communications.  We will definitely missed the teachers and school after my boy graduate this year., Good management determines the right direction and philosophy for the child care center which is essential in selecting the right teachers for your child. After all, excellent and committed teachers are what make the difference in our child's developments in the child care center. Raffles Kidz teachers had played an important role in my son's development back then, believing in what he is and could be. Thank you., We enrolled our daughter here after going for a few other school tours and knew that this was definitely the right school for her. The teachers here are dedicated and passionate. They are attentive, yet encourage independence. We can see how far our daughter has come so far and I‚Äôm happy we made the right decision. She looks forward to go school and speaks highly of her teachers and activities they get to do in school. Thank you teachers!, Both of my kids attended Raffles Kidz @ Yio Chu Kang for their entire pre-school education, and they both enjoyed the days there. The teachers are attentive and caring, and the curriculum is well designed. Well done Raffles Kidz and keep it up!, My child has been attending school from he was 20 months old. He enjoys attending school, the curriculum and friends at YCK. I've seen how he progressed over the past few months, speaking loose words to having a proper chat with us now.

RK was the only school that the students stood up and greeted us (impressed!). What caught my son's attention was the in-house playground and the laughter from the kids that were playing at the playground. The school also has a huge car porch for convenient pick up & drop off, else the bus stop is just located in front of the school. Since starting school, my son we observed that he is always playing happily when we fetch him from school. Love how he has become more sociable and responsible. E.g. wiping up his own mess and taking initiative in some simple household chores. The feel of the childcare feels very homely yet systematic. The teachers and principal are very open to communications (prompt reply too). Impressed with their level of dedication and caring attitude towards the kids. The school also organise alot of excursions and in-house celebration where the kids will perform for the parents., The teachers are caring and dedicated to their work.

Raffles Kidz @ Yishun √¢¬Ä¬ì Best Childcare Centre and Preschool,Our baby is attending RKI Yishun since October 2023 as they opened the new branch there. She got adapted really fast to the school and is excited to go to school everyday. It‚Äôs like a close-knit family there as all teachers and students know each other very well. All the teachers are doing a commendable job taking care of the kids. As 1st time parents there‚Äôs nothing relieving for us than seeing our kid happily going to school and also seeing her coming back with an even happier mood. We can see a clear improvement of her overall skills after joining the school. So far we are happy with the decision we made after going through many open houses and school visits. Hope they will continue to maintain these high standards in the school.
Raffles Montessori (Aljunied) Preschool,"Raffles Montessori is a lovely boutique size pre school. Although the school is small, the environment is very clean and has a positive learning for the students.  Apart from the regular teacher to student ratio, max 1:5 / 1:6, the school strived to be child oriented and focussed. Every child is assessed individually and guided by the teachers with full attention. The teachers and principal never compare the children‚Äôs performance and progress with their peers. The teachers are very professional, patient and caring to the children. They are always willing to provide guidance to the children when they require and keeps close update to the parents on the child progress.  Raffles Montessori is an excellent pre school. When my child looks forward to school everyday, it reflects how much she loves to go to school.  Good job Teachers! Keep it up, Ms Jasmine and team!, Raffles Montessori is a wonderful school. The teachers put in lots of effort to make school fun, while ensuring the kids have a conducive environment to learn. This is evident from my son‚Äôs enthusiasm towards going to school every day. A small and close knit community, all the teachers in the school seem to have a genuine interest in the welfare of every student. This school has provided a nurturing environment for my son for almost 4 years now. I would definitely recommend Raffles Montessori to parents!, Teachers and staff are all friendly and caring to the students. They make sure that the kids are learning and having fun. Keep it up!!!, Raffles Montessori (Aljunied) is a good school that helps to shape my son to who he is right now.  1. Management, Principal and Teachers They are professional and equipped well with Montessori teaching skill and knowledge. They are observant and attentive to the students. The main difference is they guide and teach with LOVE!  2. School fee It is on the high side if compare to normal pre-school. However, the material used in Raffles Montessori prepares my son well to the next level of education. No enrichment class requires to get him ready for primary school. Most importantly, the school teaches him good values and shape him to a boy that respects time and able to focus on his task on-hands.  3. Location Convenient location, opposite Aljunied MRT and bus stops around the premises. It situated in a private building with a big piece of land on the ground floor for the outdoor activities., My son has been with Raffles Montessori (Aljunied) since he was 17 months old and will be graduating at the end of this year.  We decided on this school right after meeting the directress / owner of the school. My son could barely communicate then but the school puts our mind at ease from day 1.  Raffles Montessori is a boutique size pre school. Apart from the regular teacher to student ratio, max 1:5 / 1:6, they're child oriented. They focus on your kid individually and would never compare your child's progress with his peers. Many parents have the misconception that a Montessori is not academic driven and the child might not be able to catch up in Primary school but this is not the case for Raffles Montessori. Not only do they follow the MOE calendar and curriculum when the child turns 6, they don't stop your learning curve, above all, educators in school are excellent. They follow up closely with parents but is also aware and careful dealing with the child's emotions.  My kid is a single child, in school, he learnt independence and many soft skills that would help him in the coming years.  Thank you so much for everything!, Excellent teaching by passionate teachers who are effective in classroom management as well. Children are very engaged and enjoy learning there., Teachers are professional and attentive to the children. Kids are fully engaged and excited about what they‚Äôve learnt when they return home., Excellent kindergarten led by passionate directors & teachers &  great learning environment for the kids, Cheaper and better alternatives elsewhere. Area is bad too."
Rain Tree Montessori Schoolhouse @ Bedok,"My son was enrolled in the school since it opened, we‚Äôve been there for almost 3 years. My son had a great experience at the school. The teachers are wonderful, always smiling and cheerful, friendly and supportive to my son and always helpful to me. The environment, the classrooms, the playground and the learning materials are high quality, clean and enjoyable. The curriculum is pitched at the right level; my son always had fun, but he‚Äôs built confidence, capabilities and knowledge. We‚Äôd sincerely recommend Raintree., Our daughter was a student in the school since she was around 18 months. Already on the first day, we received photos of her classmates showing their care towards her. The mixed age grouping is very beneficial for her learning and development. She speaks and interacts well, loves school and brings back good habits from school to practice at home. The management also ensures that all their staff examplify good values towards everyone. It has been a great joy seeing our daughter grow, thanks to this excellent school environment., I'm seriously impressed with the childcare service here. The teachers are just so caring, creating an awesome atmosphere for my kid to learn and feel super fulfilled. My child really enjoys it everyday., Cosy little preschool with a great programme and amazing teachers. We also appreciate the curriculum briefings conducted for parents and find them very helpful., RTMS has been such a conducive environment for our child's development. The children in the school are well-mannered and the school's management ensure that the teachers are excellent role models for the students to follow. Our child gets sufficient outdoor time which helps in her physical growth, and the classrooms are equipped with all the resources necessary to engage her cognitively. We are so pleased to have found this gem near our home!, My child was in the school from 19m to 3yo.  Raintree has fostered his confidence, independence and self-help skills.  The daily morning individual activities has honed my child‚Äôs ability to focus, and has sharpened his problem-solving & thinking skills.  The teachers and assistants are loving and patient, and speak good English & Mandarin.  I love it that simple tools from our daily living are used to improve the child‚Äôs dexterity, and there is appreciation of the nature as well.  It is indeed an all-rounded school, and my child has enjoyed his time there., It is like a closely-knitted community where teachers and students of all level gets to interact/know each other. The teachers are kind and nurturing.  It has a very encouraging environment that does not limit my child's growth. Love how they have daily outdoor play :), I find the mixed age classrooms refreshing so children can progress at their own pace instead of being rigidly grouped by age : my girl is transitioning and joins her developmentally more advanced friends during AM and returns to her previous group during PM. She has delighted the family with songs like Êï∞ÊòüÊòü and ""Ireland‚Äò's Call"", lovely and sophisticated (for preschool I think) songs unheard to us before that opened up our horizons, older kids and adults alike! Most importantly, the main teachers are passionate, the assistant teachers polite and helpful., My daughter has been in this school over the last 8 months, and she has been enjoying herself and loving the two main teachers in her class. I have seen improvements and her gaining confidence to speak mandarin to the teachers and classmates. And also I like the open communication and regular updates from the school. I would like to see more parent-child activities if any, since we are now much open up after the long 2years+ pandemic, or parents' group communication if this is allowed., My kids are both in this school and they love the way the classes are conducted. They didn't even feel like it's learning because it's fun. My son's mandarin improved tremendously after transferring to Raintree from an international presch.  The teachers are caring, communication is always on point.  Highly recommended!, I couldn‚Äôt thank the teachers enough to make my 3 year old daughter feel so welcomed from day 1. ( CASA) I would recommend to parents that are seeking a Montessori learning experience for their kids to join RTM School.  Heres wishing all the teachers the best in their teaching and nurturing journey!, My son has been attending the school for the last 6 months and am really happy with the way he has progressed to be more confident and independent now. My son is left handed and so there is special attention required to help him during writing and craft time. Am pleased the teachers are able to provide that in this school and keep his individuality. The Principle and all the teachers are friendly and share regular updates over the app. They are very responsive to any queries over phone or app. Very happy I made the decision to send him to RTM !, We enrolled our daughter in this school even before the school commenced for operations as we saw the materials in the school and spoke with the teachers and had confidence this was an authentic montessori school.  Having been in school for the past 6 months, my daughter really enjoys going to school (she often tells me on weekends she wants to go to school). This is also one of the few schools I have visited which aligns with my parenting philosophy of positive discipline and I can tell the teachers have modelled graciousness and kindness to her as this is reflective of her mannerisms at home too.  We also love that the teachers are very responsive and attend to our queries very promptly., My son has been studying in the Raintree for almost a year, and I am happy with it. Recently, I attended the Montessori classroom observation  and was able to see how good the Montessori program is. There was a wonderful atmosphere in the classroom. All children were involved in the work. I like that the kids can do what they enjoy, and, at the same time, everyone was involved in all the subjects (English, Math, Chinese, Science). And most importantly, all children are happy, calm and very motivated to do tasks! Also, a big plus is that Raintree got their own playground and a garden. Kids play outside 2 times a day., Amazing nursery. My wife and I were looking for a long time to find a suitable nursery for our daughter which balances play and education and this is the perfect setting. The teachers are attentive and always have time for any questions. Any other review except 5 star is probably a rival nursery :), My daughter has been attending Rain Tree Montessori School for 10 months, I can see her big improvement, and she likes the teachers very much. The school is very clean, and has outdoor playground. Highly recommended!, The staff we encountered here was really rude, impolite, and impatient. Totally unprofessional behavior. Not a pleasant experience at all., Teachers are absolutely nice and good at treating kids, the environment is neat and clean. I'm happy to see my girl's speedy progress with Rain Tree Montessori., Excellent childcare centre with great teaching values. They follow through with the most authentic montessori approach I have seen and the teachers are all very high quality, My little on has been going to Raintree Montessori ever since she was 18 months old.

Facilities are new and clean, nice managementÔºå nice teachers fromÔºå my kid likes it, nice and clean outdoor playground. good teacher., Very nice teachers and good facilities., quality of service is not good, one of the best"
Rainbow Cove @ Alexandra,"Both my kids attended Rainbow Cove and I recommended to many of my friends/colleagues! Why? 1) passionate teachers who really connects with kids individually.. imagine having your kids eager to go to school everyday‚Ä¶ 2) conducive and clean learning environment‚Ä¶ very impt for my kids as they are sensitive to dust. If I have a 3rd child, she/he will go too!, Rainbow Cove at Alexandra is truly a haven for little ones! Our experience with their infant and child care services has been absolutely exceptional.  Both Maevis and Davis have thrived under the loving care of the dedicated staff at Rainbow Cove. Maevis, our eldest, began attending when she was 7 months old, while Davis joined at 2 months old. From the moment we enrolled them, we were impressed by the warmth and professionalism of the team. The children responded with smiles and giggles, and the teachers even went the extra mile to ensure we received pictures of their joyful moments.  The caregivers at Rainbow Cove are not just professionals; they are genuine caregivers who create a nurturing and safe environment for the children. Their genuine care is evident in their dedication to each child's well-being and development. One notable example is when Maevis was diagnosed with erb's palsy on her left arm at just 8 months old. I requested the teachers to perform rehabilitation exercises with her, and within a month, Maevis showed significant improvement. its clear to me that the teachers put in the effort for Maevis.  Moreover, the facility itself is well-designed and equipped with everything necessary for a child's growth and exploration. The colorful and stimulating environment fosters creativity and learning. Maevis particularly enjoyed riding the trike and playing with friends in the outdoor area.  Rainbow Cove is more than just a childcare center; it's a community that values the unique needs of each child. We are immensely grateful to the fantastic team at Rainbow Cove for providing an enriching and loving environment for Maevis and Davis.  Although we have sadly moved to another part of Singapore and are no longer with Rainbow Cove, we want to express our heartfelt gratitude to all the teachers at Rainbow Cove @ Alexandra for showering both of our children with love and attention during their time there. Thank you for all the love you gave our little ones., Love the infantcare in rainbow cove. My boy attended ifc in rainbow cove arc since he was 5 months old. He was breastfed since born and wasn't ready for bottle, the teachers were very patient and tried all ways to ensure that my boy drinks his milk. They straw fed and spoon fed him till he was 1yo and can finally take uht milk. Teachers are very attentive and caring and I definitely recommend to anyone looking for an ifc., Teachers here are nice, caring and very responsible to kids progress and feedback. Kids there are always so happy. Great environment from infant to kindergartens., I like how the infant care place is well lit with quite some natural lights from outside as it is close to the rooftop garden of the ARC. The food is cooked on site in their own kitchen. The teachers and staff seem experienced and patient. They even divide the babies to 3 sub group accordingly to their developmental stages. However, I think it will be better if they wear uniform., Our son went to Rainbow Cove for nearly 3 years. I cannot say enough positive things about the centre, he loved it and thrived in the environment. I would highly recommend., My little one spent three years at Rainbow Cove starting from infant care. The teachers are very patient and kind. The curriculum is very rich, activities ranging from art, music to outdoor activities. My little one loves to go to school everyday., My daughter was enrolled in Rainbow Cove @ Alexandra since when she was 8 months old. The teachers and staff are very friendly, caring and understanding. Ms. Jay, the teachers and staff at Rainbow Cove @ Alexandra are really wonderful. I am thankful to all of them for all the help and for taking good care of my daughter. My daughter felt so much at home there and had a very nice time. She learned a lot of things at school like dancing to music, having solid food, playing with classmates etc. Their daily updates and regular communication regarding the child's food, sleep and other activities is really helpful for the parent to feel connected to the child's growth and learning. The experience at Rainbow Cove @ Alexandra was very positive and enriching for my daughter and myself as a parent., Our boy has had wonderful time growing up in Rainbow Cove. He was given lots of freedom to develop and expressing himself in school. He learned many things from school especially dancing, our boy like music movement. Teachers did a good job, thankful to them for taking very good care to our boy, especially tr Wendy and tr Karen who taking care of him since he was just 2months old. They are very patient when dealing with our super active boy. Highly recommended Rainbow Cove to all parents, you don't need to worry to leaving your kids in their hands., I sent my elder boy to Rainbow Cove Alexandra since he was 4 months, and later my younger son too. Teachers there are very loving and caring, taking care of them very well. My boys definitely enjoyed school very much. They also made many friends there. Teachers update us with many photos and video daily to let us know how our little ones are doing in school. Big big thanks to all the Teachers there., Our baby boy started at Rainbow Cove when he was five and a half months. I worked out a transition plan with the Principal, Ms. Jay, to have his start slowly (in the end of January, before Covid)- only a couple hours a day for three days after Chinese New Year. During those days, I saw that the teachers were all very professional and, above all, they were very passionate. I could clearly witness that taking care of those babies was much more than just a job. After the second day, my new mom jitters were gone. Our baby boy always has a big smile on his face when he gets to school. It has been more than half a year now (with confinement in between) and I feel that I can‚Äôt say enough good things about our experience with Rainbow Cove. We are very thankful to all staff. As I said, every teacher, including the principal, is extremely patient, loving and caring. Our son even has a special connection with the auntie who cooks the food and always greets him with an enthusiastic ‚Äúhigh five‚Äù. Every day children do lots of interesting activities to activate the children‚Äôs minds and body. This happened even when we had the lockdown in April/ May. There were online lessons and we were sent activities that children could complete at home. In addition, we are sent pictures and videos via WhatsApp of our babies almost daily. I truly appreciate the time invested in taking those pictures and videos because they make my day at work. Having such close communication with the teachers makes us feel more involved and at ease, reassuring us that our boy is happy, and he is learning new skills with his little friends. At the end of the day when we go and pick our baby, we always get verbal updates too. We also have the daily handwritten personalized booklet to let us know how our son‚Äôs day went. Last but not least, Rainbow Cove is very clean and safe. We feel very fortunate to have our son in such environment! At Rainbow Cove our son gets the love and attention from a home daycare setting and the structure of a good school. We are happy to see our child flourish at Rainbow. I highly recommend this school to everyone!, I highly do recommend Rainbow cove Alexandra to any parent willing to put their child in a safe and secured environment, where they can learn and grow with the help of caring and loving teachers. I did put my baby boy in rainbow cove when he was only 4 months old, and since then he loves to go to school, loves the activities that are done on a daily basis, and especially enjoys sharing his new skills with us when he comes back home at the end of the day!! (nursery rhymes like wheels on the bus, painting, drawing, reading books, cooking, and so much more). It was difficult for me to put my little one, still so young, at the daycare after my maternity leave, and the teachers did a fantastic job, reassuring me, explaining the day in detail when I was picking him up after work, and last but not least, sharing pictures and videos of the highlights of the day, everyday!! :-) when you are at work and you receive this, your day brightens up and you feel so good to know you little one is doing great!! Thank you so much Rainbow Cove for everything you do, we love you!!!, Rainbow cove is wonderful! I put my 10 months baby here and the teachers are so nice, they comfort the baby so patiently. One amazing part is that they have many activities for little babies, like music class, painting, even making mooncakes! Especially for working moms and daddies, Rainbow Cove is a great choice!, As first time parents we highly recommend Rainbow cove! This not only a place to take care of infants, but also to enable them to grow their potential. We can tell our little one is happy to go to Rainbow cove, which also shows in the pictures/videos that the team is sharing privately with us almost everyday. A big thank you to the team for making our boy so joyful!, The teachers and principal keep me up to date daily through WhatsApp to show how Sienna is coping, and the activities that she has been doing. Tr Karen is very patient with Sienna to soothe her during her initial days of transitioning from a different childcare. Sienna really loves Rainbow Cove and Tr Karen to the extent that she walks right into school every morning, without batting an eyelid/ crying- I guess that speaks volume about a childcare and the teachers if the kid can be that happy going to school. There are also activities such as sensory play, book reading, and music. Sienna has since picked up alot of words, and is able to comprehend full sentences after going to school. A really great bilingual IFC/CC in this area that I highly recommend!, My child has been attending Rainbow Cove @ Alexandra since he was 4 months old. He is nearly 3 now and I must say I‚Äôm glad I made the decision to send him here. The environment is conducive and pleasant, and my child has learnt and progressed much in these years, and I feel that he has benefited so much during his time here.  The teachers have been doing a fantastic job, being very patient and helping him develop not just intellectually but in terms of imparting right values as well. I can truly feel that they really care for my child, and it is more than just a job to them. My child really enjoys going to school and looks forward to seeing his teachers and friends every day, and that‚Äôs really saying a lot about how good a job they have done. I also appreciate the very close communication they have with parents - I receive almost daily updates via WhatsApp on what my child is up to in school, and also verbal updates when I pick my child everyday. That really helps to start conversations and reinforce what my child has learnt in school.  I highly recommend Rainbow Cove @ Alexandria to anyone looking for an all rounded childcare!, i have withdrawn my daughter from Rainbow Cove since end April 2019 but have not received my deposit despite countless chasers. Would the management like to explain what is holding up the refund? Parents, please take note if you are intending to place your kid there, do beware., The ration of teacher to child is very good. They give timely updates and my child really enjoys going there which shows how they take care of him. The teachers are so friendly and caring to the children, it really shows that they care. The center is always clean and they ensure to give timely information."
Ramakrishna Mission Sarada Kindergarten,"Hello, I am Vidya and it has been quite a long time since I left Sarada, (2018 end). I still remember the lovely teachers, Ms Gladys, Teacher Shanti, Ms Abhilasha. This school is a place where fun takes place, on my last outing in Sarada, we went to the Science Centre, got to splatter everyone(including the teachers) with goo and the meal was amazing with red ruby coloured jelly for dessert. Three cheers for the hardworking teachers!, My Girl study here  ,, School with values  , teacher trying their best to root the good values and culture in kids . Good sports activities and healthy way of teaching encourages kids grows in good way ., It is great place with spiritual presence and for meditation. We had opportunity to stay there for a couple of days. What a peace in mind? A rare experience!, Very nice & right place to get peace of mind thru meditation, Child driven pedagogy with amazing educators., Attention  Hersifksfksts Yeyusgkg"
Riverlife Kindergarten,"I cannot speak highly enough about Riverlife Kindergarten. The nurturing environment, dedicated teachers, and well-rounded curriculum have made my child's early education truly exceptional. The staff's passion for fostering creativity, learning, and social development is evident every day. The facilities are excellent, providing a safe and stimulating space for kids to explore and grow. I'm grateful for the wonderful foundation they're providing for my child's future. Highly recommend Riverlife Kindergarten to any parent seeking a caring, top-notch educational experience for their little ones!, I have only great things to say about Riverlife Kindergarten under the principal, Mrs Tan, and her group of amazing and passionate teachers.  Both my sons attended this school. My elder son attended K1 and K2 whilst my younger one started when he was 3 (pre-nursery) and graduated from K2 this year. They absolutely adored their teachers. My sons looked forward to going to school each day. The teachers are professional, caring and well organised.  If you have doubts, please visit the school and speak to Mrs Tan, she will put you at ease., It‚Äôs really nice school for kids they with enjoy there a lot,Very friendly teachers and staff especially teacher Liz. Teacher Liz will Respond with in minuets to our doubts or questions and my kid used to fell very comfortable with her Principal is very friendly and nice person. Fee is also very reasonable. Surely recommended to all parents We are very happy with Riverlife Kindergarten and staff., Enrolled both my children at Riverlife and there was no turning back. Very dedicated teachers with a well-rounded program that prepared the little ones for primary school. Such fond memories whenever we think of Riverlife and I could not recommend this kindy more., My son‚Äôs 4 years of pre-school experience with Riverlife Kindergarten was wonderful. He had stories to share about school almost every day.  He was being showered with so much love and care by his teachers and principal. He also made so many good friends. Riverlife Kindergarten‚Äôs teachers are very experienced and teach the children good values. The principal is very hands-on with the children, prays for them and participates in their activities. My son always spoke fondly of his teachers and principal. I loved how tightly knitted the community is, with all staffs knowing the names of all children, even though the children are not in their classes. Everyone genuinely cares for one another. My son learnt and improved so much under the guidance of his teachers and principal, both academically and learning how to be more independent. I strongly recommend Riverlife Kindergarten for pre-school education., Great kindergarten to go for! My daughter is 2.5 when she first attending school and this is her first time go to kindergarten. We worried the so much about it. Luckily, the principle and teachers are so nice and patient. It really helps my daughter to settled in. Definitely recommend partners who are looking for a place for their little one!, My son started attending riverlife kindergarten school at 2 years old as pre nursery to n1 and we can really see the big progress. My son have become active from shy type, For a 2 year old he can easily get distracted on the environment but the teachers have patience to teach, he was able to read words which we we didn‚Äôt teach as we are busy parents. From there you can really see that the teachers are focusing on every students, not like simply teach and the rest will be on your kid. Teachers really engage the students to be active and to participate on any activities. They teach good values. One of the things that i like most are the videos/ small clips they share weekly for example cooking, reading words, writing letter, drawing, playing as a group/team and so on. These clips really help parents to get an idea on what their kids are up to, I was happy when i saw my son dancing on the videos as he don't usually do at home. As a parent you feel proud and shocked that they can do this. Hope they maintain sending those clips. Principal and teachers are really hands-on as you will notice how they interact with the parents after school. You will see them asking how are things? They even memorize all the names of all the students going in and out. They will also give small feedback / observation to your son to help you understand your kid more. At the end of the term there would be a video call to give the feedback on your kid, The positive feedback and the things to improve on, which is very good. The curriculum on this school is really advance, its like they are two level up on their current level but with no pressure off-course. I have said advance, as due to unfortunate things i needed to move house and move my son to nearby school.

Rosyth Child Care Centre,"Teachers are great in this school. My son was there since 7 months old in their infant care program. As at 2023, he is in N1 and really enjoys school.

School is prompt in addressing any concerns/ questions and even providing parents with detailed updates over the Covid situation. Keep up the good work!, Rosyth Childcare provides a well-rounded foundation for the preschool kids before they enter primary school. My son was there since he was 3 months old. Absolutely no regrets. The staff are all so approachable and friendly. The school is really responsive with updates. During Covid lockdown, the school went above and beyond just to ensure kids are still learning well during the period. As a parent, it is a joy seeing my son enjoying school everyday, learning well academically, emotionally and morally. It was such a bittersweet moment when my son graduated from Rosyth in 2022. We miss Rosyth! Keep up the awesome work!, Professional and friendly teachers who are willing to go the extra mile to ensure a happy learning journey for my child! And affordable for a private Child Care Centre too, definitely recommended if you are around the area!, Rosyth Child Care Centre gave the perfect head start for my children with their focus on well being, morale values and academic preparation.

Safari House Preschool (Sengkang),
Safari House Preschool Bishan,
Safari House Preschool Bt Batok,"My son was 1.5 years old when we enrolled him into playgroup. For 2 weeks, he has always been crying to us every single time we pick him up, just imagine the care given there. I personally saw teachers who shout at the top of their lungs at a children. Not sure if that is correct. Outcome after 2 weeks : Dramatic Behavioral change, fell incredibly sick (coughed until his whole face turned red repeatedly), I am seriously concerned about the hygiene practice in the centre. Since my son moved to another childcare centre for 2 months, he has never fallen that sick anymore. Make your call., The standard has dropped compare to 2 year ago. Poor management on this pre-school, the staff turnover is very high. The teachers are lazy and not caring. My son said some teachers like to shout at his peers. The teacher always take leave, and the kids are taken care by assistant teacher instead., Indeed the principle is blur and teacher quality has dropped vs 1-2 years ago.The staff turnover is high, the good teachers left and new teachers are less responsive. School did not inform the parent on the change of teacher too. My girl said the teacher is very fierce and she feel afraid to talk to the teacher., Very bad experience with this school. No way to communicate with teachers , no communication APP (little lives only for mark attendance) no email address provided only communication book , hotline is the only way to talk to school(admin), and  many of times can‚Äôt get through, admin email also respond very slow. After left the comments on their facebook advertisement, they delete the comment some more. After two and half months withdrawal then just receive the refund. The school required to buy sleeping cot from school only @ $130+ which only sells $85 in shoppe. Can‚Äôt company child even on the first day of school. When child get sick no temperature taken no phone call from teacher, no messages leave in communication book( the only way of communication channel). Tried to call hotline( both branch and main hotline) to inform school child will take MC, but can‚Äôt get through the branch hotline, and call back main hotline no one answer any more. It just happened on early of year 2023. After sent the feedback email to admin email, just receive the teacher‚Äôs call, and told me that they only take twice temperatures per day which are receiving time and after afternoon snack (or nap) time, and my child vomit is not within that time so no temperature take üò±(can you imagine this is the answer?) after I submit withdrawal form, no call from any higher level to follow up or understand more. Leave so many words here is hoping the school can really face the issue and  improve. I like their zoo-phonic teaching approach and musical instrument (Volin) included in the curriculum but I think child‚Äôs wellbeing is much more important than anything else. Do you agree? Hope don‚Äôt delete my review again., Agree with the previous commenter. Terrible communication with the school. Our little children are in the hands of these people but it‚Äôs been nothing short of a nightmare. Blur principal and teachers lack compassion and love for the little ones. Tiny useless blue booklet and such a backwards way of presenting the baby‚Äôs activities on a piece of paper daily., Definitely NOT recommend. Some teachers are not caring. I personally witness them shout at the children more than 1 time. Not a good environment for the child to grow."

SDM Ichiban (Yunnan) Childcare Centre,"all my kids went to this childcare when they were young. they have great teachers who impacted my kids till this day. (they are always talking about teacher sabrina and ÊùéËÄÅÂ∏à) and also terrific lessons like teaching the kids basic math and all which really helped my kids when they entered primary school. (my kids had great achievements in primary school and even went to gep). really a very good preschool to send your child to, One of the best Child care! I like the rigor they put into their curriculum."
SDM-Moriah Preschool (Greenwich) Pte Ltd,"Nice teachers and principal they have a great set up. However, it‚Äôs not recommended for children who are not Mandarin speaking . My friends child was in Nursery/playgroup and because the class was small so instead of having a English speaking main teacher and a mandarin speaking teacher for mandarin classes as the school originally communicated when signing up , the school had engaged the mandarin teacher to be the main teacher who could not speak a word of English(not even good morning)and this was not communicated to the parents . Unfortunately the parents only noticed this 3-6months in when the child started to show signs of fright to speak because the poor child felt no one understands him in school. The child is now in another school with an English main teacher and the child‚Äôs progression in speaking has since improved very well with additional help from enrichment classes to help over come the fear to speak. I believe other upper classes with more students have English main teachers and should have a balance curriculum with both English and mandarin speaking teachers. Just be sure to reiterate  the main teachers English speaking when  enrolling the child to be able to communicate with your child, as this may cause the child trauma especially at a very young age when they feel no one understands them in school.  I hope the school takes this feedback constructive and starts to be transparent on their communication, please be conscious of children in different ethnicities as parents leave their hearts in your trusted hands., Principal Caroline is always all smiles üíêand enthusiastic to answer any enquiries.  I am sure everyone is very busy with the children at the school, but the teachers look very steady and professional. Most of the teachers are chinese and they have many years of working experience. School environment is great and well-planned with lots of consideration for fine details.  Highly recommend this school if you stay near this area. Our child was in another school for more than 2 years before we made the switch. He is saying he likes this new school much more üòç."
Sengkang Methodist Preschool,"My children love school, thanks to SKMPS nurturing and caring teachers and all staff.

Serangoon Garden Methodist Preschool,
Seventh-day Adventist Conference (Singapore) - Adventist Schoolhouse,"My kids love going to Adventist Schoolhouse, always excited to tell me what they did in class.. Both my kids started from playgroup and another one joining next year. They have alot of activities and hands on skills for the kids which is important when I choose a school. The teachers are also caring and approachable and give regular updates., Adventist Schoolhouse had been like a second home for us. The teachers at Adventist schoolhouse have played a pivotal role in the formative years of our son. The teachers at the school are experienced & create a nurturing & enriching environment for the children. The amenities & the food at the school along with a specially curated routine for the children make it comforting for them to go through a normal day with enthusiasm. Our gratitude to everyone at ASH for contributing & making our journey at ASH a memorable one., My children goes to Adventist schoolhouse and the teachers are really warm and friendly. They treat the children with genuine love and care and I must say the children are really close to the teachers. The children also develop according to their interests and explore in a myriad of environments. My children love the little garden in the school too., We have been very fortunate to find this school for our daughter. The teachers, support staff as well as admin were brilliant and were always eager to lend support. My daughter learnt a lot in a very practical way and we made some everlasting memories. I highly recommend this school for early education., Positive learning experience,  conducive school environment and caring teachers  ASH has had many amazing teachers coming in through internship programmes.  One such teacher is Teacher Joey whom my daughter had the opportunity to interact with when she was in playgroup. Teacher Joey eventually became her form teacher a year later and it amazes me that as an intern teacher, one would have no obligations to focus on any particular child yet she took the effort to connect with my daughter and could still remember small things like my daughter's favourite cartoon character from a year ago(in playgroup)  I am sure probably other children in class would share similar heartening experiences as well pertaining to her attentiveness to details. Teacher Joey has a big heart and has so much love and care for her class children. I am grateful and blessed to have partnered her in my daughter's learning journey in PN., My daughter, Rachel, has a lovely time at Seventh Day Adventist Schoolhouse. The school adopts a very creative and naturalistic approach to learning which ensures students gain a lot of knowledge in a fun way.

Two months after entering school, the child's English has improved significantly, and his personality has become more and more lively. I hope this school will get better and better, and I hope more children will come here to study happily."
SGM Murni,"The teachers and principal don't seem to focus on the hygiene and safety of the children.  You could see them sunning the toys they have washed on the bushes. The gates of the centre are wide open which might allow strangers from entering the centre or children leaving the centre. And, by doing so, they are obstructing the residents using the common areas.  The teachers and/or principal will block the common area while walking the children from one classroom to another and would not give way to residents using the common area.  The teachers and staffs don't have basic civic manners where they would ask the elderly to walk close to the drain as they placed kid's toy along the corridor. On many occasions, the teacher would ask the elderly, even those with walking difficulties, to walk near the drain as they are blocking the entire passage way.  If the principal, teachers, and staffs behave in a less than adequate manner, it does set bad examples for the pupils as the children would follow the footprints of the staff.  You could also see parents with bicycles hogging on the passage way. Parents too block the passage way without any slight consideration for other users.  To staffs of SGM MURNI and the parents of the children, please be considerate as you are what the children look upon to."

Shaws CDLC @ Braddell Heights Pte Ltd,"The principal and teachers at this school are very understanding and supportive. Knowing that my son had a bad first experience at another school, the principal and her team of teachers made an extra effort to help him adjust better. With their help, he took to school very quickly. They also update us parents very frequently which puts us very much at ease., Shaws Braddell Heights is a very ideal pre-school for kids. It has large playgrounds- spacious running n playing ground for children.  The weekly water activities also provide kids a good opportunity to explore. I love the outdoor activities of this school.  My kids learned a lot here. Teachers are patient and helpful., My daughter had a really good experience at Shaws. The school is in a one storey bungalow with a large garden used as a playground and area for the children to do outdoor activities. The curriculum offers a good balance of learning to read/write, social skills and exposure to sports. As my daughter did not nap, their no nap program allowed her to do activities and learn instead of being forced to lie down for two hours. The principal and teachers are all very experienced and caring to the children. My daughter still has very fond memories even after leaving the school., My son has a great time at Shaws! The teachers are very welcoming to the kids and parents, they pay attention to each kids needs. Shaws has a play based learning approach and this is a great approach to make sure the kids get to play, be creative and learn at the same time. We have already seen impressive development since our son started just 3 months ago! The school has fun and educational initiatives such as different theme weeks (environment, vegetables, etc), sports days, celebrations of different cultures festivals, etc. The teachers do an amazing job to plan and lead these activities. As a mom, I feel great dropping off at Shaws in the morning knowing that the teachers will take good care of my son. I highly recommend Shaws!, We love Shaws! I was first drawn to Shaws Braddell Heights with its play-based/inquiry-based curriculum, large open field, messy/water play and emphasis on sports/nature. Indeed, these are the highlights of the school but there's also much more. The school environment is warm and caring, the principal/teachers know each child by name/face, and parents are actively involved in school events and activities (So many fun days like Pyjama Day, Crazy Hat Day etc!) Both my children attend Shaws and they adapted quickly. My youngest looks forward to messy/water play and nature time, and my oldest enjoys his lessons and PlayClub - lunchtime activities for kids who don't nap. But it's not all play too, in K2 there's a lot more focus on academics (perhaps more than I'd like but I understand the school is trying to prepare the kids for P1). It's a lovely environment and I know I'll miss the Shaws' culture when it's time for my kids to move on to primary school., The teachers and staff in Shaws @ Braddell are all very loving and patient in guiding and teaching the children. Shaws play based learning approach through sports lessons, messy play, excursion etc has made learning fun. My son enjoys going to school everyday!, It has been 1.5 years since my toddler joined Shaws @ Braddell Heights right after infant care and he has had a ball of a time in school! The school provides an extensive range of fun activities including messy play, show and tell, outdoor classes, sports lessons, mini cooking classes, and excursions! My toddler has learnt and grown so much under the team of experienced, caring and dedicated teachers. It is apparent that the staff in the school is like a family who love what they do and derive great joy from nurturing the children. We especially love how positive, diverse and inclusive the school culture is! These learning experiences and daily interactions have provided my toddler with authentic ways to develop values, acquire skills, and learn about the world. The toddler's baby brother will soon join him at school in a couple of weeks, and we can't wait to discover more wonderful things they will be together! To the family of educators at Shaws @ Braddell Heights, thank you for your passion and dedication. We appreciate you very much!, My family loves Shaw‚Äôs at Bradell! My older son when there for 4.5years and the youngest is following suit! They really build in the love for learning and playing and truly live the ‚Äòplay based learning‚Äô approach!! The teachers and the whole team  are really loving, supportive and responsive! It‚Äôs been a pleasure to work with them on my child‚Äôs journey!, Both our children went to Shaws Braddell Nursery and they absolutely loved it! Such a caring and dynamic environment to explore through so many activities! The laoshi and teachers are amazing. Best way for a baby to become a fun and kind kid, best way for parents to let them grow in love and safety ! Thank you Shaws Braddell team !!, Our elder son spent happy years at Shaws, and when the younger one turned 3, we just couldn‚Äôt wait to send him to the same school. We like the philosophy that children learn by sensing and playing. We also love the outdoor playground that allow kids to get some vitamin D every day., Shaws Preschool @ Braddell Heights has been nothing but wonderful! The educators and staff are highly proficient and have always been pre-emptive and attentive to my child's needs. We love how Shaws integrate play into making learning fun and exciting! More importantly, I would like to commend the school for its inclusivity and welcoming my child, who has mobility needs, with great warmth. A big THANK YOU to Liane and lqlimah for paving the way towards inclusivity and giving such a golden opportunity for my child to thrive and enjoy going to school! Ms Lina, Ms Ali and Rong Lao Shi and all the teachers and staff at Braddell Heights - thank you for being so amazing to the kids! Go SHAWS!!, A warm and caring kindergarten-childcare. My daughter went to Shaws Braddell Height from K1 to K2. She loved going to school everyday and had a wonderful time there. The principal, the teachers and staff, were wonderful, approachable, caring and fun. My daughter learned a lot when she was there and she learned while having fun. She always had stories about her day. The school has balanced indoor/outdoor learning program and activities, in their garden and outdoor playground, such as messy play day, swimming CCA (at lorong chuan branch), little league. The school would arrange fun activities like field trips, bake sale, sports carnival, picnics, etc., This is a really good school with nice teachers and responsive principal. When my girl first attended PG class, she cried and the principal, Ms IQ,  step in to comfort my child and make her enjoy school. Similarly when her PG teacher, Ms Ash first joined the sch, she quickly make the class of toddlers warm up towards her.. we have fond memories of the school. But we have to change sch as we moved to our new house., Warm and nurturing teachers who will go the extra mile to make sure the kids settle well. The Shaws curriculum also ensures adequate outdoor play which the kids really enjoy., Our son Koa had a wonderful time during his time at Shaw Braddle. I can only recommend it to any new parent in town. Thank you to the whole team. A great establishment for the wellbeing of our children., Shaws is the best pre school around the areas and I say this with lot of confidence after seeing the love and care the teachers and care givers provide to the kids.. We are happy to be part of Shaws!, Patient and friendly teachers, attentive and responsible administrators, friendly and reliable environment, and balanced and relevant curriculum that will matter to the kids.  Both my kids went here and would highly recommend it to others., A school that seems to really let the kids have some fun with emphasis on outdoor education and sports!! Principal is great, open and receptive to feedback. My kid likes going to school:))), High teacher turnover, unsafe premises, lack of transparency of management, unprofessional practices‚Ä¶DO NOT RECOMMEND, Really good place to nurture the kids on their growth and well rounded development., Not long after we came to Singapore, our child was new to the park and was emotionally unstable. The teachers were very friendly and patient, including the physical education teacher, a lovely teacher. They were all very good. The child has gradually entered a normal state in such an atmosphere. Thank you everyone!"
Shaws CDLC @ Mountbatten Pte Ltd (Mountbatten Road),"I‚Äôve never regretted sending my daughter to Shaws. She enjoys every single day going to school!

Little league multisports is greatly enjoyed., Shaws Mountbatten has the most awesome group of teachers!Ive been there for 7 years and I can vouch for it.Keep it up ladies!"
Shaws Preschool @ Katong Post,"Amazing pre-school if you're looking for one in the neighborhood. Great set of teachers that care a lot for the kids. Do not be deceived by the small exterior, you will be amazed at all the space the kids can use for playtime & learnings inside!, Teaching staff are all nice, patient and caring. Kids can learn through playing and they love to go to school! Highly recommended!"
Sheffield Kidsworld (St Anne) Pte Ltd,
Singapore Hokkien Huay Kuan Pre-School,"Kids here enjoy the spacious environment through their living skills programme: home simulated room and living garden! They even have an indoor sports hall so be it rain or shine, there is always ample place for children to exercise and enjoy.  Personally witnessed a few international kids who doesn't speak Chinese at all would start expressing themselves in Chinese after a few months later.  I believe that the Chinese speaking environment really helps to develop children's interest in picking up the language!, Great principal who cares for each and every child, ensuring they are well physically and mentally. Their curated syllables cover an entire spectrum of learning and children can speak well in Mandarin and express themselves confidently., Nice environment for preschoolers to learn Chinese and English and most importantly, moral values., A very inspiring bicultural learning space for pre-schooling kids"
Skool4Kidz Campus @ Fernvale,"I am compelled to share my concerns about Skool4kidz Fernvale Campus, particularly regarding their inconsistent rules and practices in comparison to other campuses.  There are notable disparities in rules and practices compared to other campuses like Yishun and Punggol, which allow parents to celebrate birthdays with their children in class. Unfortunately, Fernvale's management lacks consideration for children's well-being by excluding parents from birthday celebrations.  This exclusion extends beyond birthdays, as the management seems narrow-minded regarding events and new student inclusion. A recent example was a carnival planned for December 9th, where new students were initially overlooked until I raised the issue. The last-minute RSVP demand by 5  the day of notification is impractical for working parents, showcasing a disregard for their schedules.  Moreover, the school's lack of support for breastfeeding mothers is questionable and contradicts government encouragement. Conflicting information about a separate fridge designated for breast milk and medicine storage adds to the confusion. The staff's refusal to assist with one feeding per day due to resource constraints raises concerns and contradicts both government recommendations and the child's well-being.  Additionally, misinformation during orientation, lack of timely updates, and administrative inefficiencies, including a staff causing inconvenience with uniform promotions, contribute to an overall unpleasant experience. The campus administration's dismissive attitude towards feedback further adds to the frustration.  Overall, my experience with Fernvale Campus has been marked by disappointment and a lack of consideration for the well-being of both students and parents. I hope these issues can be addressed for the benefit of all involved in terms of the school's communication, inclusivity, and support for parents and their children's well-being., Couldn‚Äôt rave enough about the teachers at Infant Bay B. They are caring, cheerful, and very thoughtful to the children in class.  Also liked that the teachers would take the effort to debrief me about what was interesting about the day. Special thanks in particular to teacher Nor. A lot to learn about caregiving from her!  Am also impressed that the security guards, admin staff and the principals know almost every child‚Äôs name.  Grateful that the teachers at Infant Bay B were a part of my child‚Äôs development, and was quite sad when she graduated from infanthood!  Yet to see how playgroup is like, though initial impressions are that while teachers are also thoughtful, class space is a little packed., Management team could be checking infants‚Äô well-being more often and the cleanliness of the infant bay, we observed that our crawling stage baby came back home with visible dirt on his clothes (although there is a saying that dirt is good for baby to be exposed to build immunity) üôè ‚Ä¶, A bad front counter service or admin execs will make me as a parent not want to have any connection with the school. Even if the school has good teachers. Admin is supposed to be first point of contact for parents, yet they displayed such lousy customer service. Lacking professionalism, very defensive in answering queries, not reassuring for parents at all., When my grandson have join Skool4Kidz campus he has change to be discipline and the environment is healthy for kid. All stuff are polite and helpful toward parents. I want to thanks Cindy Wong , Nick Leong, Xu Shan , Zi Ying to all the  stuff they play a very great role., Sheltered carpark and pickup, spacious. Purpose built building for childcare., My daughter study here since early 2021, the management is getting good, if you are not sure, then you should join and try, SCHOOL FOR KIDS MADE MY BROTHER SICK SO BADLY NOW HE IS SO SICK UR SERVICE IS NOT GOOD U DO NOT DESERVED TO OWN THIS PLACE!"
Skool4Kidz Campus @ One Punggol,We chose Skool4Kids@OnePunggol after taking the tour of the school campus. We were pleased by the infrastructure and the warm interaction with the school staff. Our son has been enjoying his time and always excited to go to school in the morning. He is learning very quickly and surprises us by speaking new words and singing new rhymes every week. The teachers are very supportive and really helped him to get comfortable to be away from family for such long hours. The school also organises events regularly where parents could participate and there is constant feedback from teachers on the progress of my son. It has been a great journey for us so far and we are glad for our son to have an extended family at school.
Skool4Kidz Campus @ Sengkang Riverside Park,"I shall not involve d curriculum nor teachers. This will be about the facility around the place.  I have been to many different childcare centres and this has got to be one of the best places to be at. A mini garden right in front of the school, a river that has lots of water sports activities, isolated play areas and more.  If i was a kid, i would love to learn and play here. There are lots of various plants to learn abouy and a playground to have fun once done. And wen all else fails, there is even a sandpit to dig in and build a sandcastle.  With lots of things to see and do, this is a great place to hang out with your kids. Im pretty sure, even if u r not enrolled in the classes here, parents know do know ur plants, can impart ur knowledge to ur kids.  Some of the plants you may identify: Lady's Finger, Corn, Papaya and such.. there were also caterpillars developing into their other life cycles. So ya, i shant go into indepth information, else il be creating spoilers for others..  Come on down n see for urslf, cheers!!  #famwithsten #sengkang #sengkangriversidepark #plants #playground #walkinthepark, Bad management. Don't have the courtesy to inform applicants that their child is not enrolled into the school. Called the centre so many times, but only told to wait for their call, Don't be fooled by the beautiful facade. The management is terrible. Customer service is horrible. They don't reply to emails and need to send multiple chasers.  It's 2023 and the school still uses Covid as an excuse to exclude parents'involvement whereas other Skool4Kids branches have no issue with that.  It's like the school deliberately avoid conversations with parents., One of the worse customer service from their admin. Very incompetent and not professional. I wanted to change the admission date for my son from January to February instead as my son need to serve his one month notice in his old school. I asked politely if they can help me change the month of admission as according to Admin Staff Sharon, cannot come in mid of the month, which I fully understand. Hence, I requested for my son to start school Feb instead of Jan. Admin Sharon responded with, ‚ÄúHaiya.‚Äù When I asked again if she is able to assist me with this, she just ‚ÄúUh.‚Äù Then ended the call. Not even a reassurance or even a bye. When I called back to inform her that that kind of tone was unacceptable and I do not deserve that, she just , ‚ÄúOh okay sorry Mummy.‚Äù Definitely did not sound remorseful or sincere in her apology. When checking  my email, just found out that this Staff Sharon, is a Customer Service Executive. So is this how you treat your ‚Äúcustomers‚Äù? Unacceptable seriously., 1.email>called up>talking>discussing about N2 enrollment, but end up the school tour was wrongly arranged with 2 groups of N1 2.told us no cctv but comfort us that is claimable under insurance? 3.told us detail rules and regulations will only release and sign up after the trial period? 4.told us check in/out just using individual qr code. no photo taking or at least physical checking if is parent/guardian?  based on today tour, we doubt and disappointed the safety, responsibility and duty of care issues; some more at last told us no slot for N2?!, always long queue, but the teacher complain kid come in late..., EXTREMELY Incompetent, Insensitive towards children's needs and some even Prejudiced towards the less favoured or more active ones. Singling out kids & treating and making them feel like an Outcast are NO ways to teach. Emotional damage at a young age IS IRRIVERSIBLE. This branch HAD BETTER STEP UP in their QUALITY OF TEACHERS & CHILDREN'S SAFETY OR risk shut down., very bad experience, whereby teacher told the childrens that ""they should listen to instruction because they are children, not animals"". and teacher don't care for my kid and let him play with tap water thru out the half day., Hi, the recent review here it seems legit.  First impression after convo with the elderly lady in the admin office is already unpleasant., Staff attitude are bad especially the one with tattoos on the legs. No confident to leave kids there, Worst place no need to elaborate can check the other reviews and im sure its legit. Very unwelcoming., If you care about your infant, please avoid this school. Bad experience felt by few parents., Green building.  Very unique"
Skool4Kidz Campus @ Yishun,"We would like to give a shout out to the S4K's team (VP, AJ, Ms Shina and Ding L«éoshƒ´ and all staff) for their excellent care and tutelage. The teachers really go out of their way to provide regular feedback. Our daughter has slowly got more comfortable and excited with school, thanks to their amiable nature.

He was a special needs child. But not once did any teacher / parent / classmate made him feel like he was the odd one out. Special thanks to Teacher Pamela who understood his strengths and guided him throughout. Knowing that parents would like receiving updates on their children, she will go to great lengths to ensure effective communication between parents and teachers. Principal Ms Malar is also very friendly, approachable and helpful. It's been really a good 2 years with them all. Will really recommend their branch to all parents. I think their teachings are great! Oh and did I mention - we stay in Seng Kang but travel all the way to Edgefield Plains for the past 2 years ü§≠"

Skool4Kidz Preschool @ Tampines GreenRidges,"One of the centre higher ups, which is an indian lady is very rude and obnoxious. This centre is always changing principals or have no principals. I don't think this is right. Parents pay so much but the higher ups are always so rude and unfriendly to parents and there is always no principals. Management should look into this seriously and reevaluate what kind of centre leaders and what kind of image is this company reflecting."

Small Wonder @ Jurong East,"Well I think the Center is great. My son has been to the Center for a year, he likes the activities and staff there. The Principal is nice and approachable, Teacher Sara is so lively and encouraging. Of course improvements can be made here and there, but I'm sure that applies for other centers., Used to be one of the best reviewed centre in Jurong East, now no longer this case. Many parents withdrew their kids from the centre due to poor management by current principal. Parent's feedback were brushed aside and children's interest sadly no longer their focus., The parents who gave 5 stars here years ago are ratings for Just Kids @ Jurong and not Small Wonder. The rating now is poor. The new principal ang senior teacher are facing complaints from parents. Alot children left too., The curriculum for the term is shared to parents. Many photos of activities are also shared on the app. All the teachers are very good, I GIVE JUST KIDS 5 STARS. JUST KIDS!, JUST KIDS WAS MY OLD PRESCHOOL I GROW UP THERE"
Small Wonder @ Jurong West,"Very touched by the staff and teachers, esp teacher Irene, aunty Teng and aunty Yap. My son, Aidan, was so well taken care of that when I transferred him to another childcare ctr due to our relocation, I had to 'quarantine' him at home for the last 2 weeks so that he wont be traumatised when he goes to his new childcare ctr. N thanks aunty Teng for your farewell gift to him. Thx alot!"
Small Wonder @ Nee Soon,"Thrilled with our experience at Small Wonder. The dedicated staff, including Ms. Anna, Ms Doreen,  Tr. Mavis, Tr Vicky, Tr Khalesah , Chen Laoshi and all the teachers create a warm and nurturing environment. Our child is thriving here, and we appreciate the commitment to quality education and care. Highly recommend!, My daughter attended Small Wonder Nee Soon (Used to be Just Kids) since Playgroup. Teachers and Admin staffs were amazing as my girl cried for a long time when she first started and at times she will still cried when going to childcare due to her timid and shy personality. However all her teachers and Admin staff Ms Anna and Ms Doreen were always patient with her. Even the ex principal Ms Aisha would always come out to attend to my girl when she saw her crying. No words to describe the service of Small Wonders Nee Soon (Justkids) Overall my girl enjoyed her learning journey at Small Wonders Nee Soon(Just kids), My girls loves going to school ever since they made the transition to Small Wonders, was known as Just Kidz then. It warms my heart when my 2nd born since PG till now N1 whenever she sees her teachers especially Li Laoshi,Teacher Khalisah and Teacher Vicky,she will asked to be carried. I would also like to say thank you to Teacher Ernie & Teacher Jasmine for putting in so much effort on the lessons plan that my eldest enjoys going to school and would be upset if she has to miss class. All the staffs and teachers there are so friendly and loveable towards the kids., My daughter attended since she was 18 months old. She have been under the care of Teacher Vicky, Teacher Khalesah and Teacher Zai. Teacher Tee have followed her through since PG.  She have flourished under every single one of them. They are so attentive, kind and gentle with the children. The principal is also very hands on and seems to have great camaraderie with the teachers. Happy Teachers, Happy Children ü•∞, This preschool is well maintained and w gd teachers.  Both my kids are with small wonder @ nee soon, staffs there are friendly and approachable. Sch also offered a number of enrichment programmes for kids to enrich themselves.  I would recommend this preschool to parents out there., Small wonder is such a holistic and cohesive place for our young one to grow and develop. Teacher Zai in particular has a wonderful strategic way of teaching which my husband and I appreciate very much. It is essential that a teacher is both firm and kind and teacher Zai embody these qualities. Her motherly disposition and confident command in the classroom ensures a disciplined yet enjoyable learning experience., Justkids@yishun has been rebrand into smaller wonder@ nee soon. The cirriculum are really great, they are introduced to different sports, a wide variety of enrichment offers. Highly recommend with their great admin staff Ms Anna, Ms Doreen & Teacher Jasmine,  Shi Lao Shi, Teacher Ernie, Teacher Tan, Teacher Tee and many more! Happy my 2 kids attended this pre school!, my 2 kids with them and the school conduct the curriculum in fun and interactive way that my kids enjoy to go school., To: Just Kids @Yishun (posted in Skoopedia 4 months ago)  Some of the staff (attitude & treatment) towards my son & I were different. I had given my feedback in the annual surveys but nothing is done yet. Some of the parents seemed to have a prejudice against my son., The admin staff Anna was so rude, giving sigh remarks and putting me on hold when I am keen to put my son in just kids school. Told me there is still slots for n1, after correcting her on the deposits and registration fee, i asked for an appointment date and she told me there is only one slot left at the end of the call and said that there is already someone else coming today for 2021 n1 registration. It is so hard to communicate with her since she keep giving me so many wrong information., Great place for my children staff are professional., Very good child care. Competent and creative teachers, good enrichment programs."
Small Wonder Changkat,
Small Wonder Preschool (Nordcom II),"My daughter love school and there are many facilities such as art cove, indoor playground, fit and fun room, music room available which provide ample space for them to explore, learn and have fun., My daughter has been in small wonder nordcom since 18 months for 1year+ now. Its a school that deserve to be complimented on the effort from both principal and teachers. Even the check in teacher at door is always professional and check each kid thoroughly to be fair to others. I always share with my friends that the most expensive school doesnt mean its the best. To me, small wonder is best for my child because of the sincere teachers, especially in this centre., Thus far, my daughter has been having pleasant experiences learning in small wonder. I can see the school putting in alot of effort to make sure the day to day running of the Center is at it's top piority. Alot fun activities for children to be engaged. Learning is fun and meaningful. Teachers are concern towards the children well being., My son enjoy to go to school. Always talk about his friends and his day in school. The staff are very friendly!, Lovely environment, friendly teachers. The only concern is the location, many cars along the road, narrow path for people to walk in. I find it quite intimidating everytime I cross the road with my child., Well trained teachers and big childcare centre with playgroundüëç ‚Ä¶"
Small Wonder Preschool (Punggol),"Personal experience with the school is horrible. We have our four month old infant enrolled to the school and on the first day of reporting the school teacher informed us that they are not aware of my child being enrolled on the day. Despite multiple email communication with school on the registration process and all payment has been done, the school is not informed of my kid‚Äôs first day. So what they suggested is to come back the next day so they can have enough manpower to ‚Äúsort things out‚Äù. this is crazy beyond imagination., Has been queueing and waiting for 5 years but no vacancy is given to me yet. And I just live beside their school, the vicinity isn‚Äôt one of their considerations for enrolments. Their staffs kept saying the priority all goes to those who elder siblings. That‚Äôs being so unfair for those with 1 child only like me, we will never get a chance to enrol our child in this sense! It‚Äôs a ridiculous rule.  The worst thing ever is I have never ever once receive a call from them asking me if I am still interested or letting me know if I am still under their waiting list or not. I cannot even bother to call them up to enquire as I think they are totally not interested and they cannot be bothered with someone like my case who has only 1 kid. Very disappointed to know this preschool is popular yet very irresponsible and unreliable!!!  Now my child is entering P1 soon but still no SINGLE CALL BACK from Small Wonder Punggol, very lousy & irresponsible preschool!, a good place with well trained teachers and good syllabus, This used to be my kindergarten I love the teachers and some of my friends from kindergarten is still in the same school as me, The teachers very knowledgeable and caring towards the children., Cannot make it school! Teachers not responsible! Sch lead failed!"
Small Wonder Preschool (Serangoon),"Small Wonder @ Serangoon North (and as a whole Busybees) is very well organised and clear in their instructions. They do the right thing and provide timely and encouraging updates where required. Facilities at Serangoon North are very clean and tidy, it is also very engaging. Seeing all the teachers‚Äô hard work and efforts to put up all the engaging materials such as Three Little Pig‚Äôs houses, changing across themes, it‚Äôs very heartwarming to see such efforts! Teachers are also very well trained and observant to inform us even about small knocks and scratches, thankful! Thank you so much Small Wonder as always. Great teachers, leaders and support staff!, We have had the absolute pleasure of sending our two-year-old to Small Wonder at Serangoon North and we cannot express enough how thrilled we are with the experience. From the moment we stepped foot inside the school, we knew it was the perfect place for our little one's early education.  First and foremost, the teachers and staff are incredible. They are warm, nurturing, and genuinely care about each child's well-being. Their dedication to fostering a positive and engaging learning environment is evident in everything they do. Our child has developed strong bonds with their teachers, who go above and beyond to make them feel safe, loved, and excited to come to school every day.  The curriculum is outstanding. It strikes a perfect balance between structured learning and play-based activities. Our little one has thrived in this environment, acquiring essential skills while having a ton of fun. We have witnessed tremendous growth in their cognitive, social, and emotional development during their time at the preschool. The teachers use creative and innovative teaching methods to make learning enjoyable, and we are amazed at how much our child has learned in such a short period.  The classrooms are bright, spacious, and thoughtfully designed to stimulate young minds. The outdoor play areas are fantastic, providing ample space for exploration and physical activity. We appreciate the school's commitment to safety and cleanliness, ensuring that our child is in a healthy environment at all times.  Communication with the preschool has been exceptional. The staff maintains open lines of communication with parents, keeping us informed about our child's progress, daily activities, and any special events. They are always available to address our concerns or answer any questions we may have. This level of involvement and transparency is reassuring as a parent.  Finally, the sense of community is remarkable. The school organizes various events and parent involvement activities that promote a strong bond between families and staff. We have had the opportunity to connect with other parents and build lasting friendships, creating a support system that extends beyond the classroom walls.  In conclusion, we wholeheartedly recommend Small Wonder at Serangoon North to any parent seeking a nurturing and enriching environment for their child. The dedicated teachers, exceptional curriculum, excellent facilities, open communication, and vibrant community make it a truly outstanding preschool. Our child's time has been an incredible journey of learning and growth, and we are immensely grateful for the positive impact it has had on their early years., Sent my first son since PG time and going to send his siblings ! The teachers here are all very dedicated . I can see how the way they love and interact with my kids since their first day of school . My son always update me what he do each day. I could see how excited to see his classmates along the corridor while on the way to school. The Teachers can also remember their name even though they never teach them . Haha . They really check through the kids temperature and hand/foot / mouth everyday without fail.  I truly feel they enjoy study in their school ! Thank you!, The Principal & teachers are very sincere and passionate.. Also the environment & culture assured me that my child is in a safe place.., Very dedicated teachers and friendly staff, who make adults feel welcome and kids feel happy to go to school to learn everyday. My kid always come home saying and sharing ‚ÄúI love my school and I am happy at school today, because ‚Ä¶‚Äù., School is receptive towards parents' feedback. Teachers and parents have good communication. Environment and cleanliness of school is good., Love the school ! Thanks to the dedicate and patient teachers. I can go to work in peace. The admin responds fast and the principal knows the name of my child! I rarely pick my child up and the closing teacher, who have not seen me before would triple check before releasing my child to me.  The teachers really check my child thoroughly and they are very strict on the health checks and they really don't compromise on health and safety aspect.  I love the regular updates on little lives and also the termly updates. The updates on little lives are so personalise and the termly updates are very accurate, my 2 year old often come home singing, counting and talking about things taught in class as per described on the termly updates.  My child have been with them since infancy the teacher to child ratio is fabulous and thanks to the bus service my toddler can go to school! She is very well engaged, at two, she speaks well and is always excited to go to school! Highly recommended! They have very good reviews on a couple of forums too., Small Wonder @ SN has been very consistent in providing a high level of ‚Äúcustomer‚Äù experience while still keeping prices affordable. Large value, low prices! Teachers are very dedicated, directions & instructions are very clear and organised, low turnover compared to other schools. I also love the in-house enrichment camps provided by LH, as well as the enrichment programs in-house by LH.. it allows our children to be enriched without burning out our weekends. My children LOVE going to school so much, thank you Small Wonder @ SN!, This is the right school for you and your child ! The school environment is amazing and the teacher is wonderful. My son loves to go to school and he will walk in on his own without crying. The principal, teacher and staff treat all the kids like their own child. During Children‚Äôs Day and Lantern Festival they go extra miles to decorate outside the school with balloon arch üòçüòç, Great school! Sent both my kids there!  They have very attentive teachers and my kids leave with a big smile on their faces!  Thank you small wonder!, My elder boy had graduated from Small wonder last year. I have to say I love this school so much and had recommended so many other children into this school! The principal, teachers and staffs were very patient and helpful. And also very cheerful! We always know taking care of children can be very draining... And the teachers can really keep their moods up all the way! Thank you so much!  Now my younger boy is in Small Wonder now. He has delayed development condition, so when he enter schoo,  he couldnt walk very stable yet... And also he is still not able converse yet, but the principal, Miss Karen and his teachers have been very patient with him. They accept who he is and also treat him the same like others. I can feel that every bit of nuturing heart the teachers Celeste and Li xin ËÄÅÂ∏à put in.  And also every morning, he will always looking forward to go to school. The kids are always greeted by very lively teachers. The school is very big and food served are good. They recently also have an award for their food.  Basically, every morning when we put them thru the door, we will rest our mind to Continue our work or life because they are in great hands! üòä  If you want your child to be in a happy and positive environment to learn, small wonder serangoon North is the place! The best best school i encountered after hoping from another 2 preschools. Its a choice I never regret.  Thank you Small Wonder! And wonderful place for the wondrous mind!!!! üòä üòä üòä, That‚Äôs a great pre-school in Singapore. The school environment is very good and clean. The teachers are very friendly and have a complete syllabus and schedule.  The food is also suitable for my children. The school is located near an industrial area, and the tuition is much cheaper than other private schools. Very happy with this school., Principal Karen, teachers and staff and exceed my expectations. School is kept clean, in-house kitchen cooks delicious meals for my daughter and she enjoys going to school everyday!  My daughter also shares with me what they learn in school, the curriculum is not only holistic but the teachers also play a part in nurturing their character.  Thank you Small Wonder!, Love this centre at first sight -The HUGE indoor playground, the conducive environment, and the BIG space for the kids to grow and spend their full day makes me soooo excited when I first visited the centre in 2015.  We decided to move 3 of our kids from a childcare centre right below our blk to Small Wonder @ SN as we know that they will love going to school and be as excited as me if they were to see this exciting place. From the curriculum to the daily healthy menu plus the indoor playground which is as big as a HDB 5-room flat (Yes, I'm not kidding!), what more can we ask for when we are looking for a full day centre for our little kiddos?  When HFMD was rising in numbers, the school made a firm decision to stop all parents from entering the centre and adopted drop-off at entrance. This has caused much inconvenience to the school as they are highly shorthanded and teachers are supposed to be in the class with their students. I applaud them to go the extra mile just to ensure that the HFMD numbers are controlled to create that safe environment for the kiddos.  When I had my #4, I know straight away where to send her to. The infant teachers gave us daily updates via a booklet on meals, diaper change, nap and activities of my baby - and even allow me to breastfeed my baby as and when I need (during non-covid days). Every morning when I send my 8 months old baby in, the assurance the teachers gave me allows me to stay focus on my work.  A few dedicated teachers along the way has tear with us when we face some problems with the kids and walk through the changes with us. I can still remember how Karen (current centre principal) walks through with me when I am emotionally shaken with my twin boy who cannot stay focus in class. They never give up on any child and Karen spent a good few hours talking and listening to me while I pour my concern to her. Another incident was during the first few days of school, my eldest was still not familiar with the new faces and was crying before entering school. Shortly after I reached office (still thinking if she can cope), Karen whatsapp me with photos of my child playing happily with her friends in class. I am actually taken by surprise when I received the whatsapp pic as I'm not expecting any school to give real time updates to parents as they have too many kids to look after. Of course after seeing that photo, I can focus more @ work. Teachers who don't teaches our kids takes the effort to remember our kids by their names which makes the kids comfortable when they enter the school every morning.  During Circuit Breaker Days, most of our friends' childcare has no HBL and kids are just given random worksheets to work on for the 2 months. But in SW, the teachers did up the HBL curriculum to engage the kids within a very short time frame. From reading to singing and experimental crafts, we were amazed on how fast they get to turnaround this whole episode to engage the kids. Not to mention that there was even a courier arranged to deliver some books to the kids as part of the engagement. This allows the kids to stay engaged with their teachers and peers, and has no fear on returning back to school when school reopens.  My eldest had graduated in SW in 2018 - but each time when she fetches the younger siblings with us, the teachers still hug and call out to her and Children's day present was given to her through her younger siblings every year without fail. My twins will be graduating this year (2020). Afterwhich, I will have my youngest who will be graduating in 2022. All in all, we had spent a good 5 years with Small Wonder @ SN and still counting on.  Generally, my kids love school and now says 'bye mummy' to me every morning. Small Wonder had taken away my biggest worry on daycare for my kids and this is exactly what we need as parents. We are glad that we had found this school and met all the dedicated teachers and principal along the way. When my youngest graduate in 2022, we are definitely going to miss this childcare., My child has been enrolled in this branch for almost 2 years since infant and now he is nearing end of N1. The teachers I had encountered with are patient, caring and committed.  Every morning, I see different class teachers and their Admin doing temperature taking, checking for hfmd and sanitization. It seem like the teachers are rotated to the duties. Some teachers could even remember my son, despite not teaching him before. (maybe my son was to naughty?)  Whenever there is sickness out break, the senior teacher or principal would send email updating us on the condition till the outbreak ended.  My child normally arrived at 7.30am, he will be gathered in a room with the other early arrivals. I will see 1 or 2 teachers taking care of them. My son enjoy that moment as he got to interact with his buddy. At around 8am, his form teacher will fetch him n classmates to class.  Via their little lives platform, I could see my son weekly activities like painting, exploring snails, reading, presenting his toy, story telling etc etc.... This gives me some knowledge of what he had learnt in school. He could even share with me or sing the songs.  Recently they implemented student card for parents to fetch their child/children . Without the card, they will not release the child. One child has 2 student card. Despite this is a good implementation, but I think the card can be easily duplicated at home. Maybe having barcode or QR code to identify the child will be better?  There was a period of time, when my son was constantly misbehaving and restless, his class teacher (yang Laoshi)  called me to check on him. She gave me some suggestions on handling him at home and it works. After a period of time, she would follow up and feedback if there is any improvement. I appreciate her commitment and helpfulness. Comparing with my friends children's teacher from other school, they never experienced as such.  I told the teacher to try ensuring my son drinks at least 2 bottle of water a day. They did it by judging from the empty water bottle and my son health. If he didn't drink enough, he will start to cough and his dry lip. However there are times where the teacher couldn't, she would honestly inform me when I fetch him. I appreciate her integrity. To be honest, I felt exhausted just taking care of 1 child and the teachers are taking care of about 15 children per class so how can I blame them for overlooking such trival matter.  To me, their principal, Karen is experienced and clear on the objectives of children learning. When I spoke to her on an incident of my son, she could analyze the situation by bringing me to see the full picture and giving me suggestions on what they can commit to avoid the incidents. She is confident in her words that convinced me. I am particular in leader behaviors and attitude where Karen had shown the positive side. I believe a good leader will develop good soldiers. Needn't to say, her suggestion works.  My overall experience with the school has been positive. Their way of teaching suit my son well. After all this is a pre-school, I would not expect my son to be sitting on the chair listening and doing homework all day (9hrs?) It will be fun when they learn thru play, presenting their favorite toys to friends etc.. It develop their confidence thru interest.  I will recommend friends to this school and it's team. üëç, The teachers are very caring and my son really enjoys school. I really like the events the teachers plan for the children., Pros: New  Cons:  Lacking in innovation and un-inclusive; When asked about why parent circulars are only in Mandarin without English translations, the Principal Karen mentioned that that‚Äôs how they do it in Learning Vision. Processes and systems are followed religiously even when they do not improve the service standards.  Curriculum hours are only about 2-3 hrs per day; a lot of time spent on non learning activities.  Poor staff allocation; the main teacher only comes in at 8.30am, and the second teacher at 9.30am. If you drop your child off at 7.30am, he/she will be left very much unattended till 8.30am as the other 2 admin staff tend to them whilst juggling the temperature taking/sanitizing of in-coming kids.  Hygiene; management not pro-active, unlike Pat's School House that sends parents the certificate of sanitatization by vendor after HMFD outbreaks, SM does not have such a practice., The school is well maintain. Staff & Teachers are attentive to childrens need. Parent are well informed of what is happening in the school..., The school have a Wonderful team of teacher who shower their love and care for my boys. No regret and love the school environment to the max!!, This school has had HMFD for 4 months of HMFD consecutively since September 2017. Is messy and disorganised. The teachers bring out wrong students very often., Horrible hygiene  standards. Looks clean but is not. They were also blacklisted for hfmd  outbreak, Awesome school with attentive caring teachers!, nice for your children"

Small Wonder Yishun Central (formerly Eager Beaver Preschool),"I have a long story to tell and my conclusion is sending any kids to this centre is as good as sending them to a cold prison, cut off from family and relatives. Your child might pick up independence BUT along with indifference in such an inflexible centre that enforces 'military like' rules. Come on, spare those young minds. They need a healthy heart and mind to grow up. This is the first time I witness such a indifferent childcare centre and it's scary to imagine how a young child would be negatively affected seeing how some adults there behave and how rules are being enforced there. To give u some examples of their way of managing the centre:no visitors other than parents allowed(not even for a young kid who needs much adjustment to the new environment. Even parents, the director Sharon told me strictly 3visits per week allowed), cold attitudes towards visitors including grand parents, young sister of the child and caregivers. All parents and caregivers, when you hear your child crying for help in such a centre by behaving strangely at home after school, who could you ask for help from? I bet no one other than to rethink your decision to send your child there coz I believe there are many better ones out there. Much better ones., A good childcare center!"
Small Wonder Zoophonics Nordcom I,"Made the best choice at the beginning of 2021 to transfer my son from his previous preschool. He joined the k2 class for 2021 and had since made tremendous progress. He fell in love with Chinese language and writing within months! He made many new friends and most importantly the team of principal and teachers in Canberra Preschool (sembawang) , they really helped with the transition so smoothly with great support and communication. Never regret my choice. Thank you so much.  - Mummy of Kaius(k2)"

Star Learners @ Bedok Pte Ltd,"My boy has been here since he was 18 months old - he is already 6 this year and approaching graduation. Star Learners has been a huge part of his growth educationally and morally with the best teachers guiding him every step of the way. Announcements are always given in a timely fashion, and new amenities (e.g. Aircon) are constantly implemented to ensure the comfort and safety of our children., I sent my son to Star Learner's childcare center based on a friend's referral when he was just 18 months old, and it turned out to be the best decision I ever made. We relocated to the Bedok area when he was nearing the end of K1, and we transferred him to Star Learner's at Bedok. I am delighted to share that my son had a fantastic experience at Star Learner's at Yio Chu Kang, and he was warmly welcomed by the new principal, teachers, friends, and the caring staff at Star Learner's at Bedok.  One of the aspects that impressed me about Star Learner's is their approach to teaching. They have a monthly theme that is incorporated into the main books and accompanying materials. Through these themed activities, the children explore and grasp important concepts. Additionally, Star Learner's emphasizes discipline and instills the values of courage, integrity, and grit in preschoolers. It's not just about academics; the children also learn valuable social skills and the importance of giving back and being responsible citizens.  I cannot speak highly enough of the teachers at Star Learner's. They are dedicated and passionate about their work, and their commitment to the children's well-being is evident. The principal, lunch staff, and cleaning staff are all courteous and show genuine care for the kids. It's clear that they have a customer-centric attitude, making the experience even more pleasant for both parents and children.  The highlight of the year for K2 graduates is the Graduation concert, which showcases the children's growth and achievements. It's a wonderful celebration that creates lasting memories for the children and their families.  In conclusion, I wholeheartedly recommend Star Learner's at Bedok to any parents who genuinely care about their children's future. The center provides a nurturing and stimulating environment where children not only excel academically but also develop important life skills. My son's time at Star Learner's has been nothing short of exceptional, and I am grateful for the care and dedication shown by the entire team., My kid love the school and the teachers are always on the look out for the children. The activities from the school is enjoyable and most of all the kid is growing with fun and joy., It‚Äôs great to have a graduation at school. The children are more comfortable with the environment.

Star Learners @ Sengkang Sports Centre | Preschool & Childcare,"Yu Laoshi and Ms Clair really took good care of my elder boy. Even he's now in primary 1, he still insist to go and pick up his younger brother who is still at star learners so that he has an opportunity to see the teachers there, I would like to compliment both Meng and Yu Lao Shi for their dedication and commitment to care for all the kids.  My daughter had some difficulties adjusting to the school and Meng Laoshi, though not her teacher, was very caring towards her needs and helped her cope in class. She provided reassurance to worried parents as well. Yu laoshi checks on my daughter often and updates us timely on her progress as well as of any updates for parents..they both show kindness and empathy, hence I always feel safe to leave my kid in their care.  Both the laoshis are my girl's favourite teachers despite the language not being our mother tongue. I would like to compliment the Centre Principal Ms Diana as well. She has been a supportive and approachable principal, and goes the extra mile in ensuring the operations of the center run smoothly.., Sengkang sport team has been so supportive and welcoming since we started there. It's great to see all the learning and fun the kids have each day especially the extra efforts they planned ie excursion. Food is nutritious and center is clean.Thank you the team for going extra miles and care for the kids., I would like to compliment all the teachers and staffs in Star Learners @ Sengkang Sports Centre on their wonderful teaching skills and all care they gave to the children. All the contribution from them lead to the wonderful improvement in my children's performance during the years.  Principal Mrs Diana always keeps a very positive direction for the school which provided educational and interesting activities for both parents and children. The activities were not only simple interesting but also very meaningful.  Children visited the Singapore Health Board to learn how to have a healthy habit in their daily life, they went to the Peranakan Museum to explore different culture and they went to Air Base Museum to have hands on experience to the airplanes.   The school also organised many parents-child activities. For example, the Father‚Äôs Day celebration were held always in a form of sports competition and activities. It was not only making the father and children closer, but also reminds the importance of health. For Mother‚Äôs Day, centre also organised very meaningful talks for mothers and grandmothers, such as ‚ÄúHow important is regular gynaecological check-up‚Äù. The activities were not only help to widen children‚Äôs knowledge, but also show great care to the parents.  The teachers in the school are very knowledgeable and responsible to all the children, for both academic results and their daily life. My daugher is a quiet girl and always shy to speak out. With Teacher Nasreen and Xiao Lao Shi‚Äôs teach and help, she is now much more confident than previous. She got great improvement in academic performance in English, Math and Chinese. She has also acquired deep interest in the above subjects with teachers‚Äô encouragement. My son is always too active and sometime naughty. However, with the care from Yu Lao Shi and Teacher Liza, he learnt how to behave himself well and how to be a polite and nice boy.  Both also received care from all the teachers and staffs in the centre. Aunty Yati helps to provide a clean environment to them and Aunty Toh always prepares healthy and delicious food for them. As working parents, we can leave children with Star Learners without any worry.  My girl is graduating this year, and the brother will have another 2 years with Star Learners. Star Learners is more like a family to my children. I would like to say thank you to all of you in Star Learners @ Sengkang Sports Centre for providing such a nice environment and great learning journeys for the children., As parents, we might have given them some hard time from time to time, but these teachers from Sengkang Sport have performed outstandingly well in our opinion. We would like to highlight their strength and give thanks to teachers of N2 for the effort that they have put forth this year.  Teacher Liza ============= This year we manage to see Teacher Liza on a more prominent role as the N2 English teacher. As parents we are very happy on how she manages the class. She is firm when needed, as N2 class is more discipline and in order when going on excursion and also gentle when students needed her. As our daughter easily get bored and learn fast on certain situation, Teacher Liza will at times teach her some new songs and also learn basic math calculation while waiting for the kids' turn to go to the toilet, making learning fun by using elements around the environment. From my understanding it is not part of the curriculum at the point of time, and we are much appreciated that Teacher Liza have taken the initiative to do so, to keep our daughter engaging and make learning fun for her. our daugther will always come home waiting to learn to count more stuff and even teach us parents new songs. At time Teacher Liza has try to follow up on how daugther is doing at home to understand our daugther character more in dept. We truely appreciate her effort and care for our daughter.  Yu Liaoshi =========== Last year we were really impressed with Yu Liaoshi. And this year is no different. We truly appreciate Yu Liaoshi patient for teaching our daughter Chinese. Our daugther will come home excited to tell us all the beautiful Chinese words to practise and dance. Coming from a non-chinnese speaking family, at times it is very hard to follow up with our daugther's Chinese language. Yu Liaoshi have been very helpful explaining to us parents on what our daugther have learn in school and also show us books during previous PTC on our daugther favourite Chinese book in class and share abit about the book story. As parents we love to follow up with our daugther after school and Yu Liaoshi have gone her way to write down the han-yu pi-yin on the home activities for Syafiqah, making it possible for us to do so. We truely appreciate that she have gone out of her way to assist us and be very patient on teaching our daughter.  N2 Teachers ============ For the past 2 years, our daughter had to deal with teacher from her class leaving the school. And at times we are worried for our daughter development as she could get very attached to a teacher one day and suddenly her favourite teacher leaving the other day. We are very happy that Teacher Liza and Yu Liaoshi have been around for the whole of this year to guide our daugther development. Both of them are excellence teachers and work in sync with each other. Making our experience with the school engaging, interactive and worry free as we know our daugther is in good hands. As parents we would love to see both Teacher Liza and Yu Liaoshi be guiding our daugther through K1, as some of her friends (Best friends included) will be leaving school for MOE kindergarten next year. And having both Teacher Liza and Yu Liaoshi will really help our daugther go true these hard times.  School Development =================== This year we saw much of the school rebranding and we parents really welcome and appreciate the school effort to make things easy for us parents and teachers. There were bugs in the school app in the beginning, which was expected for any new software. At times bugs like not receiving app notification, not receiving invoices and etc happen and the school principle and teachers have been very helpful in relaying information to parents, to bridge in the gap.  We are happy that the app has made things easy and more secure for parents to view school activities photos, invoices, e-consent, buying of uniform and much much more., My girl has been with the centre since 2015 and graduating this year. My boy is now in PG. Teachers came and left, and each one of them had always left a deep impression on my children, especially Nayli, who is graduating this year. The smiles that the teachers put on every morning, greeting the children when they are dropped at school, makes it so welcoming for the children. To us parents, who might always look like we are in a rush to drop them off so that we can run off to work, seeing the smiles and the cheery ""Good morning!"" or ""Zhao an!"" never fails to uplift my mood for the start of the day. The staff were truly accommodating, especially in ensuring that Zuhaily is being managed better in the school, which at times will mean that Nayli has to be taken out of her class to reassure Zuhaily that everything will be alright. The staff have always been prompt in updating the goods and bads that happened in the centre albeit I cannot deny the fact that my heart jumps everytime I receive a call from the centre. However, deep down inside I know that the teachers are trying their best to do as much as they can. The occasional video updates given to me. It just reassures me that I made the right choice enrolling my kids into Star Learners. Zuhaily had a new English teacher this year, Ms Gill. Her addition to the centre was a nice complement to the centre as well. Zuhaily comes back and will excitedly share the things that he did in school, and most importantly, he remembers what has been done. He will make it a point to get us to read the personalised Children's Day card that Ms Gill has written for him. The occasional updates written about Zuhaily in the comm book is also much appreciated. Thank you Ms Gill! The teachers adore Zuhaily so much and I am so thankful that he is given so much love. What heartens me the most is when Nayli took so much time and effort to write a personalised message for each of the teachers on her cards for Teachers' Day. That is just a reflection of how much of an impression the teachers have left on her, does not matter whethere they are in direct contact with her or not. And enrolling Ms Siti into her Kids' Club? That sounds very exclusive. The Chinese teachers, namely Xiao LaoShi, Yu LaoShi, Zhang LaoShi and Meng LaoShi have been doing such a good job in teaching Mandarin in a fun way, given that Mandarin is not our Mother Tongue. Occasionally, Zuhaily will break into Mandarin at home when we are playing or reading. It has also been useful for both Nayli and Zuhaily to engage with our elderly neighbour who only communicates in Mandarin. Ms Nasreen has done such a wonderful job in preparing Nayli for Primary 1. It is highly engaging and teaching them and preparing them for the real life cum next year. I appreciate the time when she was trying to educate Nayli the importance of being humble. Thankiew Ms Gan for loving Zuhaily so much. He will always remember his pet name, Ali Baba. :) Thankiew Ms Siti for being such a comfort to Zuhaily, knowing that you are someone whom he can turn to when he feels insecure in school. In fact, you have such a warm personality that both my children can attest to that. Ms Zilla is also a teacher who makes effort to make things fun for the children, and i feel that she can totally let loose just to ensure that the children listen and enjoy their learning. Thankiew Ms Liza for teaching fun dance moves to the children during the special events in school. And Mrs Diana, thank you for always being attentive to the needs of the parents and the children, and as a principal of the centre, i am truly impressed that you take time to connect with the children and remembers all their names as well! :) I have never regretted my decision to put my children in Star Learners @ North East., My Daughter had switched from another childcare centre to Starlearners@SK Sports Centre in January 2018 as N2. And for my Son had started schooling as N1 this year January 2019.  We have no regrets to place both of our kids in Starlearners Sports Centre branch, because we can see their growth!  Most importantly, they love their teachers Ms Sitti, Ms Zhang, Ms Zila, Ms Meng and Teacher Assistant Ms Gan very much!  I can tell that they love the Principal, Aunty Toh and Aunty Yati too, because whenever my kids talk about them, they are always so happy!  Under the tremendous care and concern given by the School's Staffs, we as parents, are absolutely very happy to see our children are well-taken care of and they enjoy going to the school.  ====================================  Beginning of¬†this year 2019, I am very worried about my Daughter's phonics because alot of my surrounding friends sent their kids for external Phonics class. I didn't send my girl to any external enrichment class, as I do not want to stress my kid.  So, I had called up Ms Sitti to have a talk with her & get her advices. With her assurance, I had told my hubby to give our daughter some time. And at home, I will try to recap her phonics and what she had learnt from school.  Sometimes, my girl will tell me,"" Ms Sitti said this is a magic word!""¬† I guess she is learning Phonics well in a fun way.  Indeed, we had seen progression in our Daughter's phonics along the way. Many thanks to Ms Sitti's way of teaching Phonics to her.  As for my Son's 2nd day of school, he cried badly when I walked away and hide myself during his naptime. Ms Zhang is very patient in handling him and manage to coax him to sleep. He kept crying and do not want to school in Jan and Feb. However, Ms Meng Or Ms Zhang will always help to calm him down. Slowly, my boy had started to adapt himself and love going to school.  Apart from that, his communication in English had improved too..Thank u, Ms Zila for teaching him English! At times, our Son do catch my hubby and me in surprise, when he speaks English. =)  All these efforts are really worth complimenting for...  ====================================  Lastly, I must take this chance to thank the Principal Mrs Diana! She is a very passionate and dedicated Principal!  Take for recent case about the long overdue referral fee that I had brought up to her. It was supposed to be my friend's child Centre Principal's job to settle it, but Mrs Diana made an attempt to followup closely and reminded that Centre Principal about it. I really appreciate her effort for making the extra miles.  Cheers to Mrs Diana's great mentorship, Passionate Teachers and Caring Support Staffs, who make me totally feel no regrets in placing both of my kids there! =)  Thank u for all the love to my children! ‚ù§, The teachers are terrific in reinforcing the school values and impacting the children with life skills. Thank you for all that you do., Excellence childcare centre and dedicated teachers with meticulous cares. üëçüèªüëçüèªüëçüèªü•≥ü•≥ü•≥ ‚Ä¶"

Star Learners @ Tampines East Pte Ltd,"My daughter, LK, started her preschool days with Star Learners Tampines East since PG and has since experienced the most enjoyable 5 years! All the staff, Teachers and aunties alike, have shown her warmth and love. They make learning fun for the children and she has definitely shown progress in character, attitude, motor skills and her academics. She loves going to school so much that she always requests to attend school on Saturdays as well! I‚Äôm very grateful to all the Teachers for their patience, love and understanding. Will definitely recommend anyone who is looking for a great preschool experience to attend Star Learners Tampines East!, My son went to Star ‚≠êÔ∏è Learner Tampines East when his N1, nowadays is K1.  He loves the teachers and friends there.  Although he is very naughty, the teacher always says that he always likes to disturb other friends, so I tell him that if you are naughty again, I will transfer you to another school.  He was so frightened that he said no no no,tears rolling, showing how much he loves ‚≠êÔ∏è Star LearnersüòÜüòÜ .  The Teachers are very patient, and they are very reassured that the children are learning and growing in it. Grateful to have them‚ù§Ô∏è, Our child is a student at Star Learners @ Tampines East and we highly appreciate how dedicated, professional and thoughtful the staff are; from the principal, to the teachers as well as  as the cook and cleanliness attendants! The care and concern is not only towards our child but for us parents and grandparents too.  There is strong home-school partnership and my son is developing well with all the opportunities and experiences provided by the school. We love the awesome regular field trips organised by the school the most! Thank you to all the staff at SL@TE for giving our family memories that will last a lifetime., Awesome Teachers, exemplary leadership and super dedicated staffs! This sums up why we love Starlearners Tampines East! This is the final year for our boy at SL and we couldn‚Äôt be happier and more grateful for the growth we have seen in him. Special shout out to Ms Siti & Cheng Laoshi for their passion & enthusiasm in teaching! Thank you!, Both my children graduated from Star Learners @ Tampines East respectively in 2018 and 2021. My elder one was only exposed to Star Learners' curriculum for 4 months before graduation whilst my younger one underwent the full-day programme for 3+ years. I can see huge difference in my children's development. I must say that their Starbeam framework is incredibly amazing and all teachers at Star Learners @ Tampines East especially Ms Wani, Cheng Laoshi and He Laoshi are fabulous. My younger one is still missing his pre-school days now although he already left for 5 months., The Teachers in Star Learners are attentive, dedicated and professional. There are periodical meet the parent sessions to update child‚Äôs progress in school and there are many educational & enriching activities which can engage and let the children learn and have fun at the same time. There are some spellings tests in K2 (but lesser words than primary school‚Äôs) which can help prepare my child for primary school‚Äôs curriculum. Great job done!, My son has learned so much from this preschool and really appreciate the teachers for the teachings. My son looks up to the teachers and will do what he is required to, not lazy at all,looking forward to going school everyday. The best thing is, whenever parents feedback something, they react promptly and making sure everything is great. Definitely recommend to every parents! Especially this Tampines East outlet!, My daughter have been with Tampines East Star Learners since she was in playgroup. Everyone there was so nice and friendly, including cooking auntie, cleaners too. My daughter always looking forward to go to the centre everyday! Now my daughter already in P1, still asking me to bring her go back see all of them! Thank you, Teachers., Amazing staff with so much heart and a caring mindset. It‚Äôs wonderful seeing our son get excited about going to school every day. The teachers really make an effort to engage the kids and develop them in a very individualized way. He comes home every day talking about his friends and what he learned that day. He seems more interested in learning than ever before. I‚Äôm sure that‚Äôs because of his Teachers. My elder son was from SL too. His transition to Primary 1 was smooth and easy all thanks to SL curriculums. The management is really committed to providing a safe, fun, and loving environment. We‚Äôre very thankful to Ms. Siti and Cheng Laoshi. Not forgetting the whole team at SL @ Tampines East., Since my son was 18months old,he has been with the school. Whenever he is in school,my mind is at ease knowing that he is in good hands. The school's approach is a wholistic one,not just academic,but also character building. And it is a 2 way street between the teachers and parents. They give us parents input and they take in parents input seriously. I am glad we choose starlearner for our son's kinder education., My both children had attended Star Leaners@Tampines blk 297 and graduated in 2020 and 2021 respectively. Both enjoyed their childcare experience, the curriculum and the teachers there! My boy, YX is quite an active boy while my girl, YJ has quite a temper. But the teachers are able to manage my children and also taught them well with values. Special thanks to ‰ΩïËÄÅÂ∏àÔºåÈôàËÄÅÂ∏àÔºåMs Janice and Ms Wani ü•≥üòÑ, Teachers and carers at this center teach and care for my boys with all their hearts. They showed empathy and passion and are also good with young children. They are inclusive, patient and accepting with my boy with some needs. My 1 star less was because Malay language was still not taught in the center, in which i hope they can offer soon., The teachers at this centre are great at handling kids! Having seen how my nephew was taught and treated made me confident about enrolling my own son here as well - and i do not regret it! The curriculum is also well-rounded. Highly recommended :), Both of my kids are in SL Tampines East  and till this day, they love going to school. The staff there have been amazing and the school stood out with their warm and homey environment. I definitely recommend to anyone that is looking for quality care for their child., My son is Aung Moe Khaing. Attended since play group. He is very happy to go to school. All the teachers are taking care of children. Sharing with others is most significant improvement for my boy. Thank you Star Learners principle, teachers and the group., My child has learnt a lot in this childcare. The phonics taught has enabled my child to read independently without much help from the parents. The teachers are caring too."
Star Learners @ Tampines West | Preschool & Childcare,"Star Learners have done a great job in caring for my son. The school structure of learning was efficient as i see my son improve in his social skills, his speech became more clear. Thank you Star Learners"
Star Learners @ Tanjong Pagar Pte Ltd,"My child most of the time cried before entering in the morning. Not sure what is the kids experience inside, but the behavior is so much different after I move to another child care., Very well organise for the graduation ceremony"
Star Learners @ Telok Blangah Pte Ltd,"I would like to share my experience with Star learners Telok Blangah branch. My son was 2.5 years old and he could barely speak anything. As I had enrolled him to the full day care program of the school, I noticed he is more eager to go to the daycare and enjoys his time more. I like that they send me photos and videos of his daily activities so I feel that I know more about his day. I noticed his character is developing quickly. Also, the teachers are very friendly, communicating and take extra care of each child as I got the same feedback from other parents as well.I believe it is one of the best daycares a parent can choose for their child. So, if you are in Telok Blangah area close your eyes and choose this centre for your child. You will see your child growing with versatility., The school puts the children's well being first,  it is a happy and safe environment and the children build a strong relationship with their teachers.  The range of subjects taught and the different projects done is outstanding"
Star Learners @ Telok Kurau | Preschool & Childcare,"Principal and teachers are friendly and attentive. My kids has grown up so much the past year positively being here. Highly recommended as a childcare and kindergarten, I had an incredibly positive experience with Star Learners @ Telok Kurau and would highly recommend it to any parent looking for a safe and nurturing environment for their child.  My son attended Star Learners @ Telok Kurau for 8 months and during that time, he formed strong bonds with his teachers and classmates. The teachers at the center are truly exceptional - they are warm, caring, and always went above and beyond to ensure that my son felt comfortable and supported.  I was also very impressed with the quality of the curriculum. The center offers a well-rounded program that incorporates both academic and social-emotional learning. My son was exposed to a range of activities and experiences that helped him develop his cognitive, motor, and social skills.  The facilities are also top-notch. The center is bright, clean, and filled with age-appropriate toys and materials. The outdoor play area is also great - my son loved running around and playing with his friends in the fresh air.  Finally, I appreciated the open communication between the staff and parents. The teachers were always available to answer my questions and provide updates on my son's progress.  Overall, I can't say enough good things about Star Learners @ Telok Kurau. The staff, curriculum, and facilities are all top-notch, and I'm grateful for the positive impact that the center had on my son's early development., Terrible 'school'. It was apparent to us in our short time there that the centre is a business and not a school that cares for children.  The school principal Ms V was unprofessional and seemed disinterested in the well-being of the children. Shady and avoidant responses were frequently given. She constantly dismiss our concerns.  The facilities are dirty and not well-maintained. Children's feet are black during pick up and the shoes area stink. There were several sickness outbreak incidents that were not handled promptly. We caught HFMD AND covid within our first month there. Let alone other viruses. School staff pushes the blame to viruses in our home environment.  The communication from the school was poor. I was never informed of any important events or issues let alone daily updates regarding my child. The list goes on...  After asking around, we learned from other families that they do not particularly know why they still remain in the school and their children didn't thrive in this centre. See shocking text messages circulating in the community below. School principal Ms V does not seem to care.  While I can appreciate each individual teacher and helper at the school, the staff as a whole seemed overwhelmed and unable to provide sufficient support to the children. I worried about the quality of care provided to my child on a daily basis. It was an exhausting period for us and I would not recommend this child care center to any parent. We are now happy in a new centre for over a year and can say that in comparison, Star Learners @ Telok Kurau falls far short of adequate. Whichever family is content with the school is not paying enough attention to their children's well-being., A very good school with dedicated and patient teachers who foster a warm, personable and homely feel for the children. Recommended 200%., A school that operates as a living system for the well-being of your child. The key of a living system are the teachers and the principal who operate as one team, ever responsive to the child's needs, parent's queries, and changing environment in the post Covid years. Every teacher knew my child and engaged with me in the short time of picking and dropping off my child to a safe and nurturing environment.  My child would share positive comments shared by her Chinese and English teachers, glowing and growing as children do from PG to N1. I was satisfied by the detailed reports, face to face interaction, and zoom meetings in understanding the strengths and challenges faced by my child. We explored ways to partner as a parent with the teachers for optimum results. The teachers are open to learning too from feedback given. I have learnt from them as well as a parent.  Wishing the school the very best to continue to learn, to grow, and to deepen the purposeful work as a living system., Has a very hands on principal and very caring teachers. Teachers are detailed in knowing your children and they know the names and parents of all the kids - not just the ones they teach.  I decided to give this review after i saw there was a 1 star review from someone who called the school 5 times and couldnt get through.  This is a PRESCHOOL not a customer call centre. Yes there would be times the staff is busy, to give a school a low review for not picking up your calls is highly unfair.  They should be rated on their teachers and how they teach and care for the children., The teachers were very kind and it could be seen that they spent much time for the graduation ceremony., After 5 calls, nobody has ever picked up the phone!"
Star Learners @ Upper Bukit Timah | Preschool & Childcare,"It Was the best Decision We‚Äôve made to enrol our daughter into Starlearners @ UPT last year when she was N1. We‚Äôre so thankful to meet Principal Wendy who‚Äôs dedicated to her role. She‚Äôs responsible and Her responsiveness assured us that our daughter is in good hands. The teachers whom our daughter meets here are wonderful too! She‚Äôs well taken care of and she looks forward to going school everyday! We believe in the quality of curriculum provided in this school as We can see great improvements in our daughter‚Äôs education and she‚Äôs definitely growing up well. Thank you Starlearners @ UPT! We are grateful!, My daughter will be graduating from star learners @ upper bukit timah this week. My heartfelt thanks to the principal Ms Wendy, Teacher Lixin, Ma Lao shi and shan shan Lao shi. They have made such a positive impression throughout the past 4 years and one month. We especially like the school curriculum as my daughter learned not only through book but also through experiment and play. That's why my daughter enjoy every single day in school and in fact she look forward to return to school after holiday. The most amazing thing is early this year, my daughter came home asking me about the Ukraine war!. Only then I realize my daughter also learn about the world news and she actually learned and display empathy to the kids in Ukraine. We are glad that she wanted us to do donation and see what we can help the kids in Ukraine. At the same time, I manage to teach her about the importance of army in Singapore Enrolling her in upper bukit timah branch is the best decision that we have made. Throughout the past 4 years, the teacher turnover rate is low which is good for student. If I remember correct, teacher lixin has been with us for for the past 3 years. Whenever I fetch my daughter, I can see that every teachers is genuinely caring towards all kids. The action from the teachers can be seen and felt. Besides that if the teacher turnover rate is low, that mean the principal and the work environment should be great too. When teachers are happy, they will produce happy students. To summarize, star learners @ upper bukit timah deserve the five stars !, We are very lucky to enroll our child in Star Learner at Upper Bukit Timah. The Principal and teachers are professional, with so much heart and caring mindset.  They are very responsive to parents' needs and will do their best to meet our expectations. This school provides relatively good quality of toys and books for children. They also have their own playground facilities, children don't have to go to public playground to play.  There are also many fun activites in school which help children to learn faster and better. Role play, drama, story telling etc...make learning so much more interesting ! In K2 , children will learn more about Maths, writing words and short sentences in English and Chinese. All these helps in preparation for Primary 1. My child loves going to school, everyday she would come home and tell me what she does in school and how she much she loves the fun activites. Very grateful to these amazing staff especially the Principal, she is very thoughtful, kind, helpful and easy to talk to. Whenever we need help, she is always there. This makes us feel safe to put our child in school. So thankful to the whole team at Upper Bukit Timah Star Learner!! You have done a great job!, Excellent day care center and kindergarten. Teachers are caring and attentive. Environment is quiet, nice and clean. My kids love going there., Excellent daycare. Very caring and professional teachers and principal. Very responsive to all parents' queries and concerns. Five stars!, Nice and caring teacher, really appreciate the time and effort taken for the my boy. Thank you !!"
Star Learners @ Woodlands 888 Pte Ltd,
Star Learners @ Yio Chu Kang Pte Ltd,"It‚Äôs about time someone update the review here. The school is a ground zero for any kinds of plague. My daughter was sick 40-50% of the time when she was enrolled here,she got stomach flu, HFMD, random viral fever etc. Imagine paying monthly school fees for her to only attend classes 50% of the time and you have to see the doctor every month. While the teachers and the principal try doing their best to maintain some form of cleanliness but the parents are the main culprits. Sneaking sick children to school and trying to pass them off as healthy.  You see grandparents hiding their kids‚Äô runny nose behind the masks and acting blur upon entry. When they get caught, they kick up a big fuss and cause inconvenience to everyone. High staff turnover at the centre resulting in kids not learning anything. It‚Äôs only when we change schools then we see a huge difference in education quality and hygiene., Im truly glad my kids are enrolled into this school, the teachers and staff of this school are patient and dedicated. Their well being and milestones are updated to me on a regular basis and have worked with me on how to work on my kids weakness and strength.Thanks to their commitment towards the children I can go out/work with a peace of mind everyday.  A big shout out to all staff of Star Learners YCK! Thank you!!, Upon reaching this centre uninvited, the windows are open to outside, so anyone can see what's going on from the outside, what I see everyday is the children are lively and happy, which is what I'm looking for.  After 6 months with the centre, I think I need to put a review for their distinguish effort in taking care and updating the child everyday activities, where we parents and teachers gotta work hand in hand.  Not only that, they are extremely patient in getting my daughter to wear mask during covid despite her reluctance and temperamental.  Also the centre made extra effort beginning of covid in accommodating my kid as we are both under essential, 1 and only kid in the centre at that point of time.  Overall 10 stars for them üëçüèª, The teachers of the centre are caring towards the children. To add on, they are dedicated and passionate individual who ensure the safety, well being and learning of the children while I am at work.  Thankful for the team of teachers in the centre that allows me to have a peace of mind while I am at work., Thumbs up to the Star Learners principal, teachers and aunties for the attentiveness they give to all the kids. All of them are very caring to the children. It feels more like a home than a school. Never regretted my choice. :), good"
Star Learners @ Yung Ho Pte Ltd,"Centre is big and spacious which we feel is good for kids. Teachers are kind and loving. Our kids love the teachers very much and they enjoy going to school everyday to meet their friends. There are many learning opportunity and exposures to little kids like excursion and year end StarConcert., Would not recommend Star Learners @ Yung Ho  We placed our 15mth old boy in the school into its infant care class in May this year as we wanted him to have time to condition himself against all sickness/build immunity as per advice from parents around us before he attend pre-school. We were originally pleasantly surprised that the school had slots for infant care when infant care slots were typically the hardest to get. We thought we got lucky. We really thought. If only we knew what we got ourselves into.  True enough he started to have cough, running nose and all after he started. But what was unacceptable for us was that he contracted HFMD twice in a spam of 2 months. This was when all the signs pointed to the hygiene of the pre-school being pretty shabby. Some things we noted. 1. His pacifier was not cased up, probably for convenience, but this also meant the pacifier could be dragged on the floor wherever he went. 2. His cheeks was full of dried mucus when receiving him and then the teacher became conscious to help and wipe him. What's the point? If it is that dry, it means it's been there the whole time, not being wiped off. 3. The Aircon of the pre school doesn't seem to be appropriate. If it is 25-27 degrees, I shouldnt be slight shivering when I receive him. So imagine kids, they shower and are dried in this kind of Aircon, how not to have flu?  Honestly I don't blame the teachers, but I blame the management. Obviously they are overwhelmed. I am not going to go into the whole story abt the shortage of pre school teachers. What I am appalled at is that, the management is not helping us as parents. The 2nd HFMD was the last straw. Prior to that anytime the boy was sick, it is hard on us as parents to take leave and care for him. When we notified the school we were withdrawing the child for his well-being, instead of being understanding. They could still pull out the company policy and tell us that we had to serve 1.5 notice because our notice came in after the start of the month and as such the last day had to be the end of next month. So while we nurse the boy back to recovery and search for another pre school, we can't start him as we are held back by this pre school and its company policy which is probably just to make another month worth of fees before releasing us. Totally no exceptions considered and given to our circumstances. Even towards the end, they were still trying their best to mitigate our withdrawal. But our minds were set.  Sometimes we wonder if we have made a mistake. If we could turn back time, perhaps we should have just sent him at 18mths, perhaps also to be a better school with a more human management.  Just our luck to have met this pre-school which has drained out my husband MC as well as his infant care leaves for the whole year because he needs to support the child while he is unwell. I don't see any school policy that compensates my time and even my own health while we trust them to care for our children. It's easy to pull out the handbook when things happen but perhaps a little more compassion would help.  Parents you have been warned., both of my kids love their teachers and friends, loving and warm"
Sunflower Baby House & Preschool,"Our little girl has been here since 3 month old (alas I have to work and work is part of life too) and she has had an amazing time, made so many friends and grown so much since. We are first time parents and it was not easy finding a safe and accommodating place to ease our minds - Sunflower baby house took superb care of her, gave us daily briefings and shared so many tips and experiences with us. We love the school and the teachers from the bottom of our hearts. Of course babies fall sick from time to time but it has always been a collective effort to ride through every high and hiccups. Being able to trust the staffs of sunflower has been the greatest joy and relief we had in these 2 years. Thank you so much Sunflower baby house! Our daughter and our joyous experience with you has been a special and memorable one to be carried for life! ‚ù§Ô∏è, When we were expecting our first child, we were not sure whether we would hire a nanny or enroll to an infant care. Not convinced by the first option, we visited over twenty infant cares before coming accross Sunflower Baby House. We liked that it was a good size school, not too big, not too small, with kids from different background and nationalities. Ms Angela and her caring team made us feel reassured and confident about the school before joining and since Day 1 after we did. We‚Äôve never looked back and love how the team had always been so loving with our children. Being foreigners, we had no family support and having our kids at Sunflower enabled us to juggle between work and the family with the peace of the mind. The school feels like a little family thanks to its great caring team and the parents we became friends with. The teachers always took the time to engage and discuss with us, whenever we had any question or concern, they would always address them. Aside from that, what stood out is the Chinese level. It is very impressive compared to other schools that claim to be ‚Äúbilingual‚Äù. Our kids loved learning Chinese thanks to the laoshi they had who have been at Sunflower for decades. All in all, for families looking for a nurturing environment for their child(ren), please consider Sunflower baby house on your list and have a look! A Big Thanks to Angela and the Sunflower Baby House team for always going the extra mile and building beautiful memories for and with our 2 kids ‚ô•Ô∏è, We chose Sunflower for our older boy (now P3) when he was 9 months old primarily because there used to be a branch less than 5 minutes' drive from our place. When that branch had to close we were too lazy to find a new childcare centre so we moved to the (original) Grandstand branch. Our younger one followed when he was 3.5 months. We don't have a helper and my husband and I both work FT, so finding an infantcare centre we could trust was important.  I didn't feel the need in the past 8 years to be overly concerned about how they were doing in infantcare, then PG, nursery and kindergarten; they were always happy, thriving, and well taken care of physically and emotionally by the teachers. They enjoyed a range of enrichment activities provided by the centre, and - this is important - were adequately prepared through Sunflower's Chinese programme for SAP school life. Notwithstanding there being no Âê¨ÂÜô (that I knew of anyway, lol). We didn't send either of them for Chinese enrichment or tuition before P1 and have managed to hold out pretty well to now, we'll see how P3 goes.  The boys enjoyed their time with Sunflower, and we were very blessed to have met some wonderful parents and children as well. As with all things, your experience and perception may vary from mine, but I think there's generally no real need to be too uptight about nursery/kindergarten life. Our children, like us before them, will grow up and become their own persons in spite of whatever their parents do or don't do. Sunflower was good for parents like us because we really didn't have to bother much about how the boys were doing - they did well.  All the best to Angela, Dennis, and the rest of the team!, Our boy has been with Sunflower since 4 months (now 16 months). The care is immaculate and we have had no issues with the school. Infant care teachers are caring and our boy had definitely learnt a lot from his time in school. he is able to express himself (though simple words and sign language that school taught). School has also handled all the Covid measures well and we have utmost confidence in the staff.  we definitely recommend and will have Sunflower in mind always., My daughter enjoyed her experience at Sunflower from PG to K2. Everyone from the teachers to the support staff were warm and friendly and she also made strong friendships with her classmates. Ms Angela and the principal Mrs Patrick also gave us alot of parenting tips., Chanced upon sunflower babyhouse while looking for an infantcare for our son at a short notice. We did not have a good experience at the previous school and was cautious but we were impressed at sunflower's facilities and the brightness and cheerfulness of the school. Angela was also able to answer our worries and her confidence in her teachers gave us the reassurance we needed. On top of that the students and babies look so happy and that got us convinced. Our son developed into a cheerful and happy boy under guidance of the teachers in Sunflower. üòòüòòüòòüòòüòò, We brought our young twins at 6 months old to Sunflower Babyhouse when we couldn‚Äôt cope with them any longer even with grandparents help- they were stagnant in weight growth and the sunflower team with care and concern brought them up and they began gaining weight again. Their teachers really care for them and put in tons of effort to apply moisturiser for their eczema, a constant battle for us. They helped give medicines when baby J had prematurity conditions. We bought cakes and recorded a thank you video for all of them. The mark of good teachers is their love for the children and they have this in spades (hearts). We‚Äôll miss them loads, We searched quite abit for a suitable infant care and chanced upon SFBH. Seamless enrolment, estimated waiting time for enrolment was accurate. We have such confidence when dropping off our girl - thanks to the lovely infant care teachers, sch principal and sch owner ms Angela. Truly appreciate their timely updates and effort to help our girl acclimatise to school. We notice that our girl also comes home happy, fed and changed promptly. These may be small things, but they matter so much when selecting a school for your tiny human ‚ò∫Ô∏è ‚ò∫Ô∏è, Lovely school with great teachers who took wonderful care of my kid in IFC. The center us well kept, organized and spacious which made it easy to trust my child in their hands. Center Manager really has genuine interest in the growth of the children and IFC teachers are well experienced and so loving. Would have stayed with the school longer if I could!, Great infant care with attentive staff, high level of care and knowledge of how to handle children with patience., My daughter attended infant care at Sunflower Baby House. She enjoys going to school and is very comfortable with the teachers there!"

Sunflower Preschool @ Bedok Reservoir,"Most students did not stay beyond a year. Bullying was not properly managed, leading to high profile child abuse complaints.  Concerns by affected parents were not taken seriously, leaving many no choice but to seek redress from ECDA.  TVs and screen time were commonplace until ECDA stepped in following the complaints.  It is such a pity as some teachers were really passionate, the school charged reasonable fees and is in a convenient location with sheltered access to the bus stop.  Having said that, these happened over a year ago, and a lot of positive changes should have been made by now."

I wholeheartedly recommend this school!, Teacher Mei in Sunflower@sembawang is responsible and cares for anxiety parents like us who has no prior experience. She has been updating us ever since we registered our son. Due to the Covid restrictions, she took extra effort to call us and postponed our enrolment to a week later so that we can accompanied our son to school.  Teacher Annie is warm and welcoming. Even the gardener is friendly and took the initiative to welcome us and makes us feel at home. The centre has a private playground and garden which my son really enjoy. Airy indoor environment and aircon will be on during afternoon nap time. Highly recommended!, We felt at home as soon as we walked in. We love the spaciousness of the outdoor play area and airy environment inside the school. The emphasis on nature (gardening) and play-based learning were important to us as well. It was great to have a responsive centre manager who was so patient in answering our queries. Highly recommended!, My granddaughter studies here, we like the environment and teachers are extremely thoughtful and professional."
Sunflower Preschool @ Siglap Pte Ltd,"My son has been attending Sunflower Preschool @ Siglap since July 2023 and we are very happy with how everything has been. As a fellow educator, I am beyond impressed with the activities and curriculum that have been thoughtfully designed and planned to engage the little ones throughout the day. The teachers and Centre Manager, Ms Charissa, have always been very warm, loving and kind towards our son and family. We also love the community feel especially when there are events organised to get parents involved. The school is also very newly renovated and it is clean with beautiful outdoor spaces for outdoor fun. My son absolutely loves going to school (especially on water play Fridays!) and we are so thankful and grateful to have found this gem! Thank you so much to all the amazing staff for your dedication and hard work towards the kids., We are very impressed and satisfied with this school - Very caring teachers, practical and new facilities & simply the best programs for my son each week. I am looking forward to update this review with more positive comments about this school!"
Sunflower Preschool @ Teck Ghee Pte Ltd,"To be honest, when we first toured the school we did not like it very much but still decided to give it a chance. Contrary to the tour we had with the prev sch where the teachers tried to engage, smiles and talk to my son, the teachers at Sunflower Preschool did not bother to engage or talk. (This was on a Saturday)  The Principal does not seem to know what she was talking about and when asked questions, the answers she gives were uncertain. I think this is where we should have caught the signs and not enroll him.  On the first day of school, one of the parents will be allowed to sit in for an hour to let the child adapt. I witness a few things in the school and was straightaway uncomfortable with putting my son in the care of the teachers there.  The list are as follows: 1. One of the teacher wearing a mask kissed another infant (Honestly, i can understand if sometimes teachers very sayang the baby then they wanna hug them or cuddle and kiss them. However, there are a lot of germs on the mask.) 2. During shower, the teacher look frustrated when showering my son as he was no familiar with the place and kept crying. ( You can tell from the mannerism) 3. During milk feeding time, the teacher vigorously shakes the bottle while the bottle was in my son‚Äôs mouth to make him drink the milk. 4. The school strictly limits milk for my then 11 MONTH OLD son at 1PM & 4PM only. This is actually my dealbreaker. There is not flexibility whatsoever. I have called the principal to discuss this however she was firm and would not give any leeway. Her reason being - they are at the age where they have to train their motor skill (?) Something along the line. I have checked with other schools and there is no such policies or rules in their IFC. 5. I don‚Äôt believe the school was honest. In the school app, the school always input that my son finishes his milk. My son always have a problem w drinking his milk and there will alw be leftover. Even in the previous school, he hd an issue with milk intake and the teacher will feedback in the school app accordingly. 6. On his first day of school, HALF DAY. I trusted my son in their care and he came back w a bruise on his face. Usually i would be OK with this kind of injury as they are learning how to walk and are crawling around. But it is the first day of school and he was there for only 3 hours without my supervision. You would think that the teachers will pay more attention to the new infant attending a new school but it does not seem to be the case. I completely understand that accidents can happen but not when it is the first day of school and they are most definitely not short-handed if they are a ratio of 1:3. 7. The school is an air-conditioned facility. After showering they will put the baby in the play area where the FAN is blowing directly at them. 8. My son fall sick 3 times in the less than one month he was there. The first time was runny nose, second and third was back to back stomach flu. He had ongoing runny nose for few weeks. I had to take a lot of AL and CCL due to these. There was no notification from the school of related cases. I believe this is negligence from the school part. 9. The principal is really clueless. The school app does not allow teachers to communicate w the parents directly and only the principal has access to the school communication app. During the first day, when i asked the principal about the access for the school app, she merely said,‚Äù er, you should have access w the app cause same as prev school.‚Äù She obviously doesnt know what she was talking about. I checked w the admin afterwards. 10. We told the school that we would like to withdraw our son on the third day. However, we have to serve a month notice else our deposit will be forfeited. He cried everyday he attended school. It was heartbreaking.  In view of the above reasons, if they dared behave like this infront of the parent. I wonder how they are like behind closed curtains. (The curtains are always closed)  Please send you child to Sunflower Preschool @ Teck Ghee at your own risk., My 13months old child has been in this IFC since 3 months old. What I like about the center is the very low turnover rate. Since my child started school, the core team of full time teachers has not changed at all except for one who had to leave due to medical reason. This helps with establishing consistent routines for my child such as nap routines. And I think having low turnover helps in building relationship with my child, allowing her to feel safe and secure with the familiar adults. This is very evident every morning at drop offs when she is happy to go school, she baobao the teacher spontaneously.  In terms of communication with parents, they used an app but it's to update on the day activities (without picture) of the child (e.g. nap start and end time, milk feed volume, diaper change time). Then every two weeks, the P would send a one page file, usually with two pictures, of what my child has done for the two weeks. In short, dont expect a lot of photo updates. I'm actually very happy with this arrangement because it means the teachers' phone usage time is very low. They can really focus on the children. Anyway they update me every time at pick up and drop off so I think that's good enough for me.  Overall, the P and teachers are very assuring and always work collaboratively with us. Once in a while, the teachers will advise me to work on certain skills which I found really helpful.  ‚Äî  Add on:  With regards to feeding, based on my little one‚Äôs experience in the school (but please check in with school), before they go on solids, the milk schedule is individualised. We have to key in the app the last feed we gave to our baby before sending to school so that they know what time to give the next feed. In fact there was once I forgot to key and teacher had to call me.  Then when my little one is able to sit well on a chair (usually around 7months), they will be given oats at 10am (replace a milk feed) - you can either choose to eat the one given by school or you provide. Then when she was promoted to mobile side, usually around 10-11months when they can stand, the oats was replaced with porridge and there is also a tea break (most of the time are fruits) at about 3pm.  After one year old, there‚Äôs also breakfast at 8am. I find the teachers really understanding because they tried replacing the 8am milk feed with the breakfast provided but my girl kept crying despite consuming a lot of the breakfast. They updated me at pick up on the same day and told me most likely she couldn‚Äôt adapt to the change (for breakfast only, she was ok with the rest of the solids at other timings that were introduced much earlier) and suggested to continue to give her a little milk in school and then they will give her a reduced portion of breakfast after that. We agreed, the teachers tried and it worked! So I would say there is flexibility when there is a need to!, had to say something after seeing a 1-star review of the IFC, which our daughter is in since when she was only 2+months. She has been with the IFC for 10+ months now.  Overall, we are very pleased to have found this rare gem at such a price point.  WHY?  1. the IFC has its own dedicated space and does not cluster-congregate with PG, N1 & N2. There was a sofa within for teachers to 'rest' and feed the babies.  2. the teachers, mostly mandarin speaking, really care of the babies. will there be accidents? yes, my daughter hit her head a couple of times, but hey, try taking care of 3 babies concurrently. what I appreciate is that the teachers were transparent and share during dismissal without sweeping under the carpet.  3. the principal often pops over and will personally cover any shortfall in manpower / MC. Have seen her doing so a few times. because afterall, everyone knows taking care of babies are not easy because they are more vulnerable.  4. There is regular teacher-parents meet with parents. This tickled us previously because honestly, what is there to update for babies? and also, they already updated us weekly and also biweekly over the app. The principal works on Sunday and send parents the biweekly update on Sunday. if this isn't dedication, I don't know what is.  5. when our baby girl had eczema, the IFC teachers were very willing to help with the cream application because they were truly concerned. They also spent the effort to 'troubleshoot' with us initially on what might be the cause, changing bath lotion and body cream.  6. when my baby was transiting to solids, I was very worried because she had a couple of episodes vomiting in her sleep midnight. The Principal and IFC teachers worked hand-in-glove with us to help tide through this phase, sharing in full details of their meals / ingredients and even calling me personally to address my worries.  Did I ever think of pulling my baby out and changing centres?  Being a first time parent, yes, I did. Because she kept falling sick every 2 ~ 3 weeks initially. but after reading some parents' forum, I realised it is the rite of passage for all babies/children, even for IFCs which charge $2+K per month. Further, babies do develop awareness over time. It is traumatic for babies to change schools and change carers. Hence, I dropped the idea completely. Glad I did.  and yes, I do recommend this IFC as long as it is the same Principal and the same IFC teachers. :), Had to share my experience after seeing the 1 star review & feels that somehow things doesn't add up here.  Sent my first child there since he was 4 months old & 2nd child also managed to enroll in the school, both receive lots of love & affection from all teachers.  Communication has always been a breeze with the school teachers & principle, in the initial phase when the app wasn't available yet & also now, with the usage of the app. They will usually give an informal short update when we pick the kids up as well.  The team has always been very transparent with the kids activities, be it good or bad. This gives us the confidence that they are actually bother about the wellbeing & growth of our kids.  Feed scheduling: I left this to the experts as they are trying to establish a feed routine for the kids & in the long term it will make life easier for everyone, parents included, since the kids will want to feed at a fixed timing, making it easier to plan around them.  Injuries: refer to top.. Very transparent about all incidents thus far. They will call us if it is too serious but hey whats growing up without a few bumps & bruises?  With regards to the kids falling sick while in school, it is a known fact that this will happen no matter which pre-school they are sent to. Probably the only way to skip this is to bubble wrap them in a clean room environment, i guess.  No issue with the communication over the app or what so ever. They have a hotline & whatsapp number for emergency contact, in case you need them for whatever reasons.  Curtians.... Hmm, given the location of the school beside a common walkway from a busstop, I can understand why curtains are needed. Certian level of privacy should be given to the occupants of the school, be it the teachers or the kids.  Send with confidence!"

Sunflower Preschool @ West Terra Pte Ltd,"Bad experience with the principal during the school tour. She comes across as someone that parents would love as she knows the words to say to ease parents' worries but she doesn't give me the confidence she will do what she promises. The tour session is like a ranting session by the principal - ranting about the ex-principal, her staff, incidents in her centre. During the tour, the words that the principal used were unprofessional and reveals discriminatory practices."

Sunshine Kids Care Centre @ Punggol Pte Ltd,"My boy Jonah had joined the playgroup and he's gonna to P1 soon. Principal Christina was his PG teacher, she was really joyful, helpful and understanding. A big thanks to all the teachers and Staffs for taking good care of my three children! ‚ù§Ô∏è, Both of my child are enrolled with sunshine during their early years and had since graduated. I strongly like the way they educate our boys, to be independent. Early childhood education is important. And Clara is very friendly and takes in our feedback. This review comes a bit late but still, till today, I will still recommend sunshine to my friends., Sunshine kids is one of the neighbourhood schools whose principal (Christina) puts in efforts to organize events to engage parents in understanding more about the school cirriculum and to provide parenting tips, given most of us are first or second time parents. Events like these are not easy to organize and the efforts are very much appreciated. Our kids have been there only a few months and while the centre does not utilize ""high tech"" solutions like other preschools to communicate with parents, generally we've been receiving consistent feedback and communication from the school with regards to our children's wellbeing and upcoming activities  Generally we feel that sunshine kids is a good neighbourhood preschool, albeit a little bit on the older side, but with good friendly teachers and a great principal, Review on Punggol branch My first born Nicole who is now 19 years old in NUS currently was from Sunshine. Surprisingly there are quite a few of her kindergarden ex class friends in VJC during that year. We are quite impress on the early childhood influence. Some things must have done right.  My 2nd born Kendric graduated this year 2023 from K2.. overall this is a great neighbourhood school who the management spend great effort . Infant care is a new section so no comments as my son was  not from this infant care. He joined in play group and progress along. Teachers overall are fine with some exception ones .. there are ups and down moments especially During covid period. We can see great effort from the principal. The gradulation concert was well planned and great entertaining which leave good memories for all of us.  Thank you Sunshine for leaving positive memories for my kids., I have the most amazing experience to share. My son is diagnosed as 2e (twice exceptional) gifted child with autism + dyslexia. Since infancy, he has problems attending several prestigious childcare centres in town area. He is now in K2, 5 months to Primary 1. I have decided to look for a childcare with a good review of the principal. I told the Principal Ruth truthfully that I need help to integrate him for school readiness, and I am entrusting my son in her hands. TADAH! All my 5 years of worries and struggles are non-existent in this centre! My son fits in readily and happily! REJOICE! It is also our great blessing that his K2 Teacher Maria is special needs trained. For the first time in his life, my son is willing to attend a school outing without me! And wakes up for it! Thank you Principal Ruth, Teacher Maria and Centre Team! If you seek a loving and supportive team, this is where the heart is. BIG THANKS from a very appreciative mum. (first posted 4 months ago)  Update My Kayden has graduated! Super thankful to Principal Ruth, Teacher Maria and Fang Laoshi(Chinese language teacher) for putting in so much effort and love to prepare such a good concert! I would never believed my son could go up the stage and posed like he did. He has grown up so much in his short time at the Sunshine Kids Care Centre (Punggol Field) and I am sooooooooooo proud of him overcoming his fear of big crowd. The performance of the young children was amazing (evident of Class Teachers' training effort) Attached is his graduation photo.  Thank you to all the teachers and the kitchen auntie for taking such care of him too., I would like to express my deep concerns regarding the quality of education and care at Sunshine Kids Care Centre. My child attended the school for a brief period, and I was extremely disappointed with the level of service provided.  One of the most alarming issues I observed was the chronic shortage of teachers. Despite being a well-known neighbourhood preschool, they are continuously understaffed, which results in the children not receiving the appropriate attention they require. I noticed that the turnover rate of teachers was quite high, which further worsened the situation. The lack of continuity in the teaching staff made it difficult for my child to settle in and establish a stable learning routine.  Furthermore, the children's turnover rate was also high, which was a cause for concern. The frequent comings and goings of students resulted in a disruptive and unsettling atmosphere for the children. The children require a stable environment to develop their social and learning skills, which the preschool failed to provide.  I would advise parents to think twice before enrolling their children at Sunshine Kids Care Centre. The chronic shortage of teachers, high turnover rates, and disruptive atmosphere can have detrimental effects on children's development. I urge the school's management to address these issues promptly to ensure that the children receive the education and care they deserve., My boy had joined the infant care group since he was 4 mths old, and he's gonna transit to the playgroup class pretty soon. Principal Ruth was really helpful, understanding and active in communicating with us about my boy's status whenever required. Grateful and a big thanks to all the Staffs(including the Teachers and helper aunties) that had taken great care of my boy in the centre. My 2nd boy is coming soon and had already registered our interest to place him with the infant care group as well! Feel  assured and confident of their professionalism in taking care of my precious ones, big thumbs up for the centre! Please continue to nurture our future generations on the very first few steps of their learning journey!, My 1st born is one of the first few infant that joined the infant care at Punggol when they started the infant care service. She was 3 months plus when she joined and is 18 months now. Through out the 15 months there, we are happy with her development and thankful to Ms. Ruth (Principal) and the teachers there who showered her with care and love.  Over the 15 months, there were some minor scratches sustained but nothing serious. And we were always informed of such scratches by Ms Ruth or the teachers. Occasionally, we would notice diaper rashes and would feedback to the teachers/Principal and the teachers there would take extra care to change the diaper more frequently throughout the day.  All in all, I think being a neighbourhood childcare and infant care, they had done an excellent job in taking care of my daughter and contributed to her development. The centre also organizes events during festive period and invite the parents to participate which I think it's a good initiative to allow parents to have a glimpse of how the centre culture is like.  We have already booked a place for our 1st born to join the Playgroup and also plan to register our soon to arrive 2nd baby for the infant care as well., My son attended the Punggol Sunshine Kids infant care since he was 11 months old. I could see that he enjoyed the school, and learnt so much from it. The teachers are caring and love the children. They are also accountable and will report to the parent if anything. They even called and asked if my son allergic to certain food (e.g. eggs) before giving to him. Now he is turning 18 months old, he will be going to the Sunshine Kids childcare. Hope he will adjust well and will continue to grow and flourish there. I am sure he will miss his teachers at IFC :') Thank you Principal Ruth, fellow IFC teachers and kitchen aunties!, My wife and I were told by principal that the infant care school teachers to babies ratio are 1:3. But from my wife's observations, the ratio was usually 1:8. Our baby looked sad every time we fetch in evening. I saw good reviews of the school but most reviewers only have a few reviews under thier profiles. How can we trust those reviews ?, Thank you to the staff of K2 class of 2022, Sunshine Kids @Punggol for guiding our children not only to be a great performer on stage for their graduation concert but also in guiding them in terms of what to expect in their lives moving forward into the new adventure of Primary School environment and learning. Tq so much all for the effort! Especially Tr Maria! And Fang Laoshi. Not forgetting the 5yrs running emcee Tr Christina! :) keep it up guys! G.o.o.D.j.o.b Good Job Good job üé∂, My review here is for the sunshine infant care centre. My baby has suffered for 3 months in this centre with a serious cut on the head which became a permenent scar. The school teachers did not inform me immediately. When my wife and i fetched our baby, we noticed the cut and the teacher lied that it was due to our baby to pull the helmet of other baby. We knew that there are CCTV cameras installed on the center and we asked principal for an explanation. After a long delay, the principal told us that it was likely due to a circular teaching tool which had sharp edges and that the babies were not well seated on chairs and the tool was passed around among the babies. In addition to the cut, we noticed that almost all babies cried when a china teacher carried them. Upon further enquiry with a former teacher, we found out that the teacher scolds the babies everyday and we also saw that she shook an infant violently when the infant cried. We had to change school to let our baby leave this horrible place., My girl joined K1 class nearly year end, and she not able to follow the syllabus. However, teachers patiently guide her and encourage her all the time., My 2 kids are from Sunshine Kids from year 2015 to 2021. They enjoyed their times there. Great teachers great principal. üëçüèº ‚Ä¶, Cosy heartlander child care unlike those mega centres that are so commercialized now. This is what I want for my child - a community where he can grow up knowing everybody‚Äôs name and vice versa, not just another face lost in the crowd. Two thumbs up for the management and teachers!, Teachers and non teaching staff with the Management are very caring and hands on. They are encouraging and brings out the best in every child"

Super Talent Childcare Ltd (MacPherson 122),"I've been associated with SuperTalent for a total of 7 years (it was formerly known as Moral Childcare) since Dec 2012 for my daughter's enrolment into N1 and subsequently my son's enrolment into PG in Jun 2014 (Many thanks to Ms Chong for the reservation of place, despite running almost full capacity).  I'm very pleased with the holistic learning & training approach for both of my kids. The phonics, speech & drama, reading programs and various outings (kidzania and zoo) broadens their learning out of the usual curriculum.  These set a strong foundation for transitioning to the main stream primary school environment.   The centre is located in Macpherson, an aging mature estate which also taught the kids to care and be compassion to the elderly in the regular activities at the senior activity centre.  The strong partnership fostered between the staff members (Principal & Teachers) and the parents allows for regular communication on school programs and child's development progress/status.  I've no qualms to refer anyone to this centre.  It may be natural ventilated without any air-conditioning system, but it creates a great start to my kid's lifelong learning journey !, A review which is long overdue. Rude principal and inattentive staff. Not recommended."
Super Talent Childcare Ltd (Membina),"The teachers are very caring and takes really good care of my children. Am really glad that my children are in good hands.

The management has put safety guidelines and measures to ensure the area is COVID safe. Going inside, there are different play areas or sections within the premise. Each play area is unique and allows both teachers and learners to interact with each other using different props and toys. The interior of the school is painted with cartoon animals and play objects, which makes the atmosphere very lively and visually appealing to kids. We can say that the management has put great effort into making an environment conducive to learning and supportive of the well-being of young learners. Our daughter is currently taking up weekly phonics enrichment classes. Each morning, we can see how excited she is to learn and go to this school. After class, she is very eager to show us what she learned thru the learning materials they did in class.

We always like to ask him if he prefer this school or his previous. He always says this current school., Enrolled my 3 years old daughter for Phonics class. Teacher was excellent and my daughter really enjoyed the classes. The lessons were very interesting and useful, helped to widen her skills. Also the management was very flexible and responsive., Sent our son to the infant class when he was 6 months old and now he‚Äôs 16 months. The teachers have been taking very good care of our son ever since. They taught him baby basics - crawl, walk, speak, do things independently and also cultivate many of his good habits. As first time parents, we have learnt a lot from the teachers on how to take care and discipline our son, we are thankful for that., This school is great for my son who has autism. They are very understanding of his needs and helps with his learning too. Small class is good as the kids won't be too distracted and teachers are very attentive to them too. Very good location and easy access., My daughter enjoys going to school everyday. She likes all the teachers and enjoys learning in the school.  Thanks to teachers effort, my daughter has been progressing well in her education and character building till today., The Teachers are very understanding, patience and full with heart when teaching and caring for my kid. They are very responsible and helpful when it comes to developing and nurturing the children. I am very much appreciated for being able to find this pre-school and enrolling my kid here. Well done and bravo to the Teachers there., Super Amazing Curriculum. One of its kind in SG where every lesson is a fulfilling enrichment. Student get to be co-creators of knowledge, explorers etc. They conducted scientific experiments and acquire science knowledge in the process, make their own games, learn how to prepare even their own meals (culinary, motor skills, cultivate independence etc), learn a musical instruments including even parts of a ukulele all without extra costs. For such solid enrichment, most preschools will require additional payment to be made under enrichment which can be quite hefty for working parents but at SuperGenius, every lesson is as fulfilling as it can be. Impressive, Enrolled my daughter in infant care. I love that her teacher always give me feedbacks and communicate to me about her well being and progress in school every day. Photos and videos shared assure me of her development and nurturing experience she‚Äôs having in school., Enrolled my son in infant care. Infant educarers are genuinely enthusiastic in providing the best bespoke care, especially in learning development. Centre is located on the ground floor of Heartbeat and beside a playground. Centre has a nice scandi interior design and is fully air-conditioned, which projects a warm and welcoming feel. Stroller can be parked inside the centre. Fees are on the higher side, but commensurates with the service provided., My foster son has ADD. He is socially awkward and quiet because he has pronunciations problem. I was very pleased when the teacher, Mr Othman assured me that the speech and drama program  I enrolled him in will help improve all that. The fees was high but no regrets. He gained confidence only after his 5th lesson. He loves stories, is now an avid reader and talks almost non-stop, oblivious to his still funny pronunciation. He even corrected me when I make sound mistakes. He is now an enjoyable companion coz we communicate so much with each other . Oh yes, he has acquired a great sense of humor too. A few days ago, he proudly claimed that his brain has grown and he's  no longer in special classes for 'not so good' (clever students). So proud and happy for him. Thanks Teacher 'O'., My daughter language skill improved a lot after enrolling in Phonics & Reading. Thanks to Teacher Poni, she is very experienced and she provides a constructive feedback which helped to focus on the improvement., I would highly recommend this preschool to anyone looking for high quality infant care! Though the infant care fee seems to be a bit higher than average, it is a great investment in consideration of the professional & caring teachers, optimized staff-child ratio, clean & spacious classroom, interesting curriculum design and the convenient location., Have enrolled my child since she was 2 months old. Great environment, teacher will update school activities and event. The infant's teachers are well trained and professional., Like other first-time parents, I was hesitant to send my child to infant care at the end of my maternity leave. Now I am glad about my decision to choose this preschool because I can feel that the teachers really care about my child & keep me posted on his learning & development., There is an obvious improvement on the followings:  Confidence in my grand daughter's speech especially in area of pronunciation.  Expressing self  Sudden interest in story telling., the teachers are well train in teaching children. kudos to teacher denise, pony and O for being there with my children during their growing years.., Great school!

Superland Pre-School (100 AM) Pte Ltd,"Our daughter started Superland Montessori 100AM at 18 month and we are now completing the 20th month attendance  The school is modern but very cozy and extremely clean. Staff, teachers and principal are making a special effort to create a very pleasant and happy atmosphere. The kids menu is tasty and healthy. Food is prepared daily in the school kitchen which takes care of any special dietary requirements  The schedule is filled with a variety of learning activities, art, drama classes and baby yoga.  The school bus ride, supervised by a friendly teacher , is very reliable.  A what‚Äôs up chat keeps us constantly updated with our daughter learning progress and news.  There are several additional activities such as excursions,  theatres and other celebration  Our kid loves the school and have created a special bond with the teachers.  We are grateful to the teachers for taking such good care of our daughter and for  contributing to her growth and mental development., Our kids have been attending the Superland Pre-school 100AM from its opening in 2019 to the date of this review. It is a Montessori-inspired curriculum (not a full-on Montessori school) and our kids have thoroughly enjoyed the school and really liked their teachers. In addition to immersive Chinese class daily, they also offer Japanese and French classes - our kids really enjoyed both Chinese and Japanese classes!! I feel the curriculum is diverse and fun, lots of hands-on activities and very engaging for the kids while also preparing them well for classroom style education. The teachers have always been so thoughtful and creative, and put in lots of efforts to engage both kids and parents. Even during the last two challenging years of COVID-19, the teachers quickly picked up teaching online and tried their best to show parents kids' progress - nice, fun videos too!  A few teachers have changed but usually only at the end of the school year. And as an ex-teacher myself, I know that means the school is a relatively enjoyable working environment so that the teachers were all very considerate when leaving the school; happy teachers = happy kids!! The administration team keeps the parents well informed.  One of our favorite thing about the school is its space - it has lots of natural lighting and relatively high ceiling (both rarely found in the CBD area!). Even though has a bit of echo and aircon is quite cold, it feels spacious and has enough space to play. It also has an outdoor field upstairs but due to COVID-19, they have stopped going up -- hopefully it will restart soon!! Another thing that my kids have told me is that they enjoy their meals at school - a small but important thing to note! :) The administration team upkeeps the school very well and communicates with parents regularly - all parents also have direct communication with teachers via an app.  We deeply appreciate the wonderful teachers and staff Teacher Abby, Teacher Clarie, Teacher Si, Wang Laoshi, Liu Laoshi, Kaori-sensei and Principal Wahila and Ms. Nisa for supporting our kids through their early education for the past few years!, Son recently graduated from the 100AM campus. He was in the pioneer cohort, stayed w the school since day1 , been a memorable and wonderful 4 years for our family. We didn‚Äôt switch schools even after we moved u see our son had grown attached to his friends , his teachers n the environment‚Ä¶ If ur looking for the above attributes for your kiddo in a centrally located preschool- this is it. Helmed by principal Wahila together w her team of quality, enthusiastic teachers Clarie, Abby, Diana, Si, Wang and admin Nisa, u‚Äôll find your kids in the wonderland of preschool - be prepared for creative presentations of curriculum, lots of engagement and they come home talking smarter than u. I recced several preschools before selecting this campus so save yourself these trips and thank me later :), Teachers are caring, curriculum is all-rounded, environment is welcoming. Many fond memories for the kids."

Would definitely recommend it !, My daughter has had a wonderful 1.5-year journey from Infant Care to N1 with Superland Bukit Timah and as parents we could not have been happier to find this school from day one. It gave us a positive vibe visiting this school from day one till now. The bright, beautiful space and colorfully decorated, clean classrooms made us feel reassured that this was a safe, hygienic and cheerful environment for children. Both the teaching and non-teaching staff are very warm and friendly towards children and know them by their names! My child is happy at drop-offs and comes out cheerful at pick-ups which makes us feel very comforted as parents that she has a good time at school. The curriculum structure as well as activities towards building social, language and gross motor skills have laid a sound early foundation. Her teachers are very caring and very responsive to questions/requests. We also receive regular photos and updates/reports of the ongoing learning and play activities via the app and that is always nice to see as parents. We are especially thankful to Tr. Fari, Tr. Janna, Tr. Patricia who were her main carers in IC, PG and N1 for all their warmth and hard work in making our child feel cared for, as well as Tr. Joey, Tr. Jenny, Tr. Ying, Tr. Vicky, Tr.

The teachers and management regularly communicated with the parents and were very approachable. Thank you Superland, for giving our sons a lovely preschool experience!, My boy is taken care by Teacher Fari and Wang Laoshi from Superland Bukit Timah. Both are caring teachers -- they are attentive. I am always happy seeing surprises from my son when he shows what he learned from pre-school that I haven't expose him to from home., My son has been going to Superland‚Äôs infant care for 10 months now. We are very happy with the school! My son enjoys himself in school, judging from the photos that the school shares. The teachers are very warm and caring, which is evident during drop-off (no matter which teacher). My son is very close to Teacher Janna in particular; I think that attests to how well she takes care of him! Also appreciate teacher Janna‚Äôs honest sharing as it helps us to adjust our child caring positively (:, Truly thankful for a good school with both caring teachers and non-teaching staff who provide support to us parents.  My daughter has been with the school for coming 2 years, and I have noticed first-hand that she is more independent and sociable these days.

Special mention to Teacher Eileen, we appreciate your timely updates and being such a good teacher to our daughter!  As for my son, he has been with the school for almost 4 months now, attending the infant care programme. We are truly thankful for Teacher Janna who is his main carer. She does such a good job and we feel so reassured when our boy is in school with her.  My husband and I appreciate the teachers for their professionalism and patience while our kids transited from home to school care. There is also an app for communications between parents and teachers and we are thankful for the constant updates about our little ones. Another plus point is that the campus is so well-built! We love the high ceilings and brightly lit space!  Superland BT has provided a safe space for my kids to grow and explore. Would recommend Superland BT to parents looking for a school! üòä, My child has been attending this school for about 6 months now and Overall Satisfied with what this school has to offer.

Whenever we passed by the school, she would tell others excitedly that ""That's my school!"" The staff did a great job maintaining frequent communication to parents via an app and also via email (kudos to Teacher Joey and Teacher Jenny!). My daughter kept mentioning how much she loved her teachers, who are very patience and loving.  Teacher Ash is particularly good., My husband and I count our blessings daily when we drop our kid off to Superland Bukit Timah. From the incredible campus, endless free space, indoor and outdoor play areas - it is incomparable to the incredibly committed teachers that care for our child. They go beyond the call of duty to ensure my child is well fed - both nutrition wise and education wise. Their smiley demeanours and creativity really is boundless. We especially want to thank Teacher Joey, Jenny, Ms Kim, Teacher Faz, and our ABSOLUTE MVP FAVOURITE TEACHER MS SAVITA. Who is the main factor that gets Owen out of the door daily to go to school. Thank you for being so incredible!!, Superland Bukit Timah is the chosen school for our daughter despite the location being quite a distance from where we live because of our great experience during the school tour.  Joey was the staff bringing us around back then and her honesty and professionalism were commendable. She is equipped with knowledge about the school‚Äôs operations and have remained very friendly to us.  Our little one has been there since she was 7 months and is almost there for a year now, and we are still very satisfied with the school. We like the app that the school uses for communications. Teachers are responsive with replies and we receive regular updates about her.  The teachers are all very patient and caring. We feel very at ease sending our daughter there., We had to switch our daughter to Superland due to a home move and during COVID restrictions which meant neither of us are allowed to accompany her to ease her into the new environment.  Our worries were unfounded though, as the team at Superland made her feel really comfortable, so much so that when she was down with COVID in isolation, she was asking to go to school.  The school environment is great, light-filled and there is a dedicated playground for the kids too.  The teachers update the communication app regularly and it is always reassuring to see photos of our daughter enjoying the activities in school.  The school engages parents on a regular basis as well. In the 9 months our daughter joined the school, we have had 2 parent-teacher meetings, 1 art exhibition and a school excursion.  Overall we are extremely glad to have chosen Superland Bukit Timah for our daugher., I visited a few preschools before deciding on Superland Bukit Timah and I've been super happy with my decision.  The teachers are warm, caring and patient. They know exactly how to handle toddlers and separation anxiety.  My daughter is in the playgroup class and lessons are interesting and comprehensive. Her vocabulary seems to have exploded since attending school!  Communication with parents is also very good through the app and I love the photo updates.  The school grounds are clean and well maintained.  My daughter loves going to Superland and asks for her teachers, friends and school regularly., My son has been at Superland for 7months now and we only have great things to say about this school. The classroom environments are light and well set up and the teachers and staff are always kind and considerate.

It's a truly great school and we're so happy we chose it for our son., My baby went to infant care Superland Bukit Timah and got settled quite quickly. The teachers are very kind and gave us proper attention and support. They respected his routine and he was very happy there!, My son , LZW, has been at Superland ever since their opening days and although these are our first experience sending our boy to preschool, we couldn‚Äôt have been more pleased with the hospitality, care, serious loving joyful face of all the teacher‚Äôs there for their warm and always energetic ways of greeting us ! special thanks to Joey, the principal, which i always amazed by how she can remember hundreds of kids names by her heart , also been super accomodating and helpful from day-1 till now.

You guys are what makes Superland ‚ÄúSuper‚Äù . Thank You !!, It is an amazing school, please look for teacher Joey for school information Super friendly lady. My boys enjoyed it a lot especially the outdoor playground! Elder one came back with a lot of stories and the fun he had in school:)  I just happen to see the review below parent post regarding to the poor management and bad teaching quality of this school. I could not agree any of these. Below are my responses: 1) Teacher to Student Ratio-It is 10plus to 2 teachers in our N1 class. And in K2 my boy class there is only 10 kids in total. 2)There is an online portal where I am able to communicate anything real time to my boys' teachers and even school admin. they normally respond in one hour. 3)Joey is by far the most responsive teacher I have ever encounter, she works later and replies messages after working hour. 4)I choose this school because of the amazing environment and so far, my boys' class there are no teacher change yet., Our kids love this school. The teachers are caring and kind and go way above and beyond to address parent concerns on the odd occasion where something goes wrong. The commitment to the kids and the hours they put in (including responding to messages on weekends or late nights) is better than I could have ever expected., The school is full of joy and caring with amazing facilities. My son truly loved the school and his classmates. Daily program has good combination of indoor/outdoor play time and diverse learning activities. Plus, Korean language class as 2nd language was exceptional!! Highly recommend!, Our daughter has been attending Superland BT for 1 month and she loves going to school. The centre is clean, bright and well-lit. Ms Joey is very helpful and responsive dealing with administrative matters. The teachers update the parents via the app so we know what‚Äôs going on during school time. They have lots of hands on activities and outdoor play, and organise big celebrations for Children‚Äôs Day and Halloween. Our daughter loved it! We highly recommend Superland BT., Ms Joey is awesome and super responsive. We went down for a visit in Oct 2021 after seeing all the amazing reviews about the school. She was super responsive and manage to slot us in for a Sat tour on the same day.  Ms Zara was also very good and assuring from the start and made the transition for our son super smooth. I love how they focus on the positive of each child and often assure them and made them feel confident.  The centre is bright and big with both indoor and outdoor playground.  Our little one has been there for almost 5 months and he enjoys himself everyday.  What we loved most was the transparency and how they handle HFMD, Covid, Stomach flu etc, they will give parents first hand information and we appreciate that a lot.  My little one is in N1 and Ms Ash and all the assistant teachers, Chinese teachers are amazing. He picked up so many words in the last few months and he is exposed to so many different experiences, language, ballet etc (the additional language is also part of the curriculum)  Highly recommend ( and this is coming from parents who tried 3 preschools before this), Was looking for a school for my 1st born to attend. After visiting and comparing a few schools, I've decided to enroll her into Superland bukit timah. Thank god my decision was right! Am really happy and glad that Ive choose this school. Best decision made. Love the interior and deco of the school, really love at first sight. (Please go down for a school tour, you will know what I meant.) Super friendly and well trained teachers and staff. (Trust me. They are really very nice!) I'm really impressed how they can remember every single kids name in the school from different levels and classes. Love the morning vibes and greetings from them! Constantly updating my girl's progress and well being, attending to my queries and troubles. Im really glad that my girl got used to school life very fast after sending her to school. Through photos sent by her teachers, I know my girl really enjoying her school life. She will come home singing new songs and saying new words/sentences learnt from school. And at times, me and my husband were impressed by her. Now with my 2nd born, I can't wait for him to attend school like his sister, because I know both of them will be in good hands. Really superb school. Keep up the fantastic work!, Dedicated teachers & staff team,  well trained to handle kids, paying detailed attention to individual child needs, and yet being able to also attend to many neverending parents‚Äô requests with so much patience and understanding. Thanks Superland BT team! My toddler daughter adjusted well at the school all thanks to Superland BT teachers‚Äô patience and love showered upon her! We also appreciate the parent-teacher portal for all communication needed, fast & efficient. Their Montessori styled education also allowed my daughter to discover and express her own individualism, talent and character. We are happy with how she has integrated well in school, she is often sharing her happy times with us when she returns home from school., My wife and I made the decision to enroll our son into this pre-school immediately after the tour. We love how principal Joey is prompt and clear with her responses. Shoutout to teacher Anisa too for being super caring and pro-active in updating us on how our boy is doing in school. This school is definitely filled with people who love doing what they do with their well rounded curriculum.  We also love that they constantly keep close contact with us and are open to our feedbacks to solve any problems.  Last but not least, we love the cleanliness of the place and how they take health protocol precautions to make the school a safer place for the kids!, I am so impressed with  Joey! Moving to Singapore was a big change for us and was hesitant about where would be best for our son. I was given a tour by Joey and my son instantly formed a bond with her. We came back 2 weeks later and Joey remembered both of us by name. Her loving and caring nature was exactly what i was looking for. We were made to feel very welcome on both occasions and never pressured to make a decision. My son is very happy at Superland and i am so grateful to Joey for being so approachable and caring. We have truly been made to feel  very welcomed. I would recommend Superland, I sent my daughter when she was 16 months to Superland Bukit Timah and she has been there for 4 months since. My experience has been great and I have recommended this school to my peers. The space is huge, well lit, clean and very organised. The Teachers and Principal (Joie) have been very supportive, trustworthy and reliable.   I always feel at ease after dropping my daughter at the school. My daughter has picked up social skills and started to develop into her own confident lady. She was a very picky eater but after going to school, now feeding is easy for us., My husband and I enrolled our child on the spot after visiting the school - it was exactly what we were looking for - great curriculum with a perfect balance of academics, fun, art and music etc., a clean and neat environment full of natural lighting, and a welcoming team of teachers and principal. This school is very different from all the other 4 we had visited. Joey had been very helpful with the enrolment process and it's the small things she does that we appreciated (she has superb memory when it comes to remembering adults and kids she meet, even if it's a brief encounter), and was very responsive to every question we had throughout - thank you! Teachers are super patient and we can see that our child has smoothly transitioned into this school after a couple of weeks, and most of all, he enjoys himself a lot. Highly recommend Superland @ Bukit Timah., My daughter has been at Superland Bukit Timah for a week. It's a new experience for her to attend a preschool. The staffs are very caring and experienced. They settled her down fast and encouraged her to participate in activities. My daughter is happy with the school now. I would also like to thank to Joey. She is very responsible. She communicates with us well whenever we have questions. So far my experience there is very positive. I highly recommend you to consider Superland Bukit timah as your children's future school, Superland Pre-School at Bukit Timah is definitely a hidden gem. We are immediately overwhelmed by the beautifully designed yet functional campus the moment we stepped in. Joey has been there since the very first day and we are so grateful that we've met her. She has been very engaging, patient, professional and transparent over all the processes and activities at Superland (BT). We are sincerely thankful for that and glad that our child has such a delightful place to learn and grow. It is without a doubt, this is the happiest and most fun preschool environment for a child. The school focuses on positive learning, time management, grace, common courtesy and social skills. Its a definitely a wonderful balance. The teachers and staff really love their work and all of the children are incredibly engaged in the classroom (Thank you for the beautiful pictures). Lastly, not forgetting Zehzeh Teacher Rashelle at the door, thank you so much for everything and your kindness. Anyone looking for a preschool? Look no further. Joey is ready to speak to you. =), BEST DECISION EVER to enroll our kids into Superland Bukit Timah!  The team of teachers are superb, communicative and professional. Regardless of the massive number of competing schools in this area, Superland stands out as the best in terms of a holistic curriculum and price point (Deep Value).  The school is super clean, neat and bright which provides our kids with a good environment for their growth and education.  Our son was fairly young (18 months) and we were very uncertain about getting him used to the idea of pre school. Thankfully the team at Superland were very attentive to him and was able to settle him down fairly quickly. We get regular updates through an app and are happy to learn about how he is doing for the day, week and month.  For parents who are afraid of HFMD or Covid clusters etc., FEAR NOT! Breakouts are contained fairly quickly as the kid is quickly isolated away in a safe area while the parents are informed within minutes to take their child home. Cluster updates are also given daily to ensure parents that the kids in school are safe.  A shoutout to the team of teachers, Joey, Rachele, Ryna and many more!, We moved to this area and for convenience, picked the school nearest to us with an available slot for our then 18 month-old. This was a brave move for me (I'm a teacher myself) as I usually do a ton of research on anything. But when we saw the space and met Joey and Teacher Puteri, we decided that this was the school for us. Now, 6 months on, we're still loving the school.  The space is really, really beautiful. The warm tones sit well with me because it doesn't overwhelm the children, but that's just aesthetic, right? The ones who really make a true difference are the teachers.  Every morning, we are greeted with Joey's amazing enthusiasm and my daughter went from crying at the door to walking in confidently, in just a matter of weeks. We are kept in constant update on what's going on in school and we can be sure that Joey is ever-present in her communication with us.  Just this morning, there was a crazy thunderstorm and when the teacher saw us parking, she ran out with a giant umbrella so that we'd stay dry. What more could we want? :)  Thanks Superland and all you amazing teachers who deserve so much more love and credit than you're ever given. xoxo, My child has been attending Superland (BT) since she was 13 months old and so far the experience with the school has been a very pleasant and enjoyable one! My child learnt so much from the school - signing please and thank you, dancing and recognising to songs that were played in school. The school has made me discovered the sides of my child that I never knew, i.e. bravery! I look forward to all the many updates from school via the app.  It warms my heart to see the way my child looks at her teachers (teacher Joey, teacher Liana, teacher Pat) - that is when I knew my child is very well taken care of :')  So many good things to share about the school:  - On admission, enquiries and school tour arrangements were handled very promptly. - Passionate teachers, helps to ease my child into school - The older kids at school are also all so welcoming and warm to the younger child - The school takes actions on feedback - School's environment is so pretty (bright, spacious and airy!) and good cleanliness - Strong sense of responsibility and accountability - The teachers around the drop off area are always cheery. - teachers always spare time to speak with the parents at pick up - The responses with the school is always VERY PROMPT, even on weekends!?  Depending on the route you take, the downside could probably be that it requires a little walking if you were to get to the school by public transport. Also, the school is not a partner or anchor operator - so the school fees are expected to be higher than the schools who are!  I am so grateful to have chosen Superland!, My boy has been labelled in his previous school as autism even before his has been checked by the doctors. He was ostracized and deprived of learning by his teachers and principle in his previous school. We were only informed by the teacher assistant of such acts. We immediately pulled him out from that school and involved him in school selection by bringing him with us to school visits. He finally picked Superland Pre-school. He was unable to speak properly before however 2 weeks into Superland, he came home able to articulate properly, he showed signs of confidence in doing things himself and he was happy to go to school everyday! I would like to shout out a BIG THANK YOU to Joey, she has made the transition of changing school a breeze and she constantly update and communicate with us on his progression. Joey is a passionate & professional educator whom always reassuring and making us feel that our boy is in a safe and happy environment for learning. THANK YOU JOEY! Can't thank you enough!, My son attended Superland Bukit Timah and he absolutely loved it. Caring and loving teachers and staff, he made great friends and he would come home singing the songs and talking about what he did. He also enjoyed a wide variety of celebrations in his short time there - Mid Autumn Festival, Children‚Äôs Day, Halloween and Deepavali. I‚Äôm sure the unique diversity of teachers and students contributed to the enjoyment of these activities, and exposed him to embrace this diversity! Apart from the photo updates, there were frequent bi-weekly updates with pictures from his class Teachers summarising what they learnt the past fortnight. I appreciate the effort they put into this. It was a good way to see what they learnt at school and how much they enjoyed it!  During the time he was there, I experienced how the school navigated through a COVID-19 and HMFD outbreak‚Ä¶ communication was clear, calm and frequent, and I am assured they did their utmost best for everyone‚Äôs safety and a quick and smooth transition back to normalcy., My son loves to attend lessons at this pre-school! Everyday he would be asking me "" Mama, can I go to school?"" The teachers there are very friendly and would always update me with photos of his school life. I am very appreciative of them and to be honest, I am very rest assured whenever my son is in school., I should start the review by saying I never wanted to share this to selfishly keep the herds from coming in but that‚Äôs not fair so here goes!  Our beloved preschool closed some months ago and in choosing a new place, I wanted to join a preschool that was communicative and focussed on play! It was also important to me that the principal was proactive and vested and thankfully, we had the pleasure of encountering Joey and her team at the new super land at Bukit Timah. Apart from the impressive premises that comprises an in house chef, multi language programs and a super cute library for the kids, what convinced me was the communication, effort and friendliness of Joey.  She knew all the kids in the school, was quick to attend to any needs or questions, and went out of her way to make me and boy feel comfortable about the transition. Throughout the many school disruptions due to covid, Joey and team were proactive in getting home packs done and are always checking in to see how the kids are going.  Now that my boy has been there for months, the Teachers have been patient in attending to his needs even the arduous process of potty training and Joey in particular has reached out to ensure everything including the birth of my second child was a smooth one for me and my boy!  The school has lovely Teachers who are responsive and communication is always quick and transparent. The only downer is covid which has restricted outdoor and excursions and I hope that can resume soon!  The disclaimer is this review is for nursery and I cannot judge the academics of kindy yet!, Superland made it to the top of our list. Aside from the Montessori and theatrical based curriculum, the facilities are inviting with cozy and bright classrooms. I had a school tour with Joey and it was pleasant. She was informative, accommodating to answer all questions (regarding both Superland Bukit Timah and Tanglin branch) and the tour didn‚Äôt feel rushed at all even though we came to our appointment 15 mins late. Follow ups have been great too., My son lovea attending school! Staff who greeted us at check-in are always warm, cheerful and full of energy! The bright, spacious and clean premises also exude a positive vibe which I really like.  Will definitely recommend the school!, The unique design of the building that this pre-school is located in makes for a bright, spacious, and clean feel to the place. There are also mini indoor and outdoor playgrounds, as well as different classes that cater for English, as well as a choice of up to 2 mother tongue classes each week. Definitely a good, all-rounded choice for the little ones., Really nice environment and lovely teachers :) friendly and warm community, Amazing school with ultra friendly teachers who know how to handle children and bring out the best in them. Principal Joey + teacher Rashelle have been some of the most understanding people we have dealt with despite putting in a lot of scheduling and admin demands on them and their team.  That being said, it‚Äôs hilarious to see pathetic attempts to slam this school. If you are bothering to read reviews in such detail, then kindly disregard the single bad 1-star review left by hater parents such as ‚Äúanon ymous‚Äù. Ashamed to leave a review with their real identity, such parents expect the universe to be delivered to their child. Every point they have brought up can easily be refuted. Instead, their condemnation highlights more insecurities about the reviewing parents‚Äô inadequate parenting style than anything else. Every other parent has posted gleaming 5-start reviews that are well deserving and I think that is where a prospective parent‚Äôs thoughts should eventually gravitate towards., A special thanks to all the team at Superland Bukit Timah - we enroled our son when he was 12 months old and was difficult for us to part with him at such a young age. But he was made to feel so comfortable and welcome by everyone, and we were kept uptodate with his progress through regular photos and communication. They are also very accomodating if you have any preferences or needs for your child...again, thank you so much and it was great to see Finley's development from attending. 5 star rating!, When we moved house, we moved our son from Superland UE Square to Superland Bukit Timah.  It was a wise decision.  The teachers and staff are patient, genuinely caring to the kids and show great empathy to us struggling parents!  I've seen so many times, teachers at Superland Bukit Timah going out of their way to help parents.  Fetching umbrellas, lugging strollers and once, even helping to change a punctured car tyre!  There really isn't enough awareness and recognition of the effort that pre-school teachers have to put in everyday for what would be the children's first taste of school life.  Well done to all pre-school teachers and staff @ Superland Bukit Timah!, - Improper guidance and poor understanding of children‚Äôs milestones and development. - Bad teacher to student ratio - Lack of Teacher parent communication - Centre manager Joey is extremely unprofessional in her conduct and delivery - Messy environment with extremely high staff turnover, reflecting poor management - We have since taken our child out of school and are utterly disappointed with Superland and will be following up accordingly with ECDA, What an impressive nursery. Teachers are engaging and friendly Class rooms and bright and modern Regular updates on childs health Nutritious lunches Fully recommend, My son was on this superland unit for about a year, he was very happy during his stay at the school. Their staff is very dedicated and well prepared., The Teacher is very nice and patience. The school is also quite new and bright. The kids are willing to go school everyday, We have been with superland for more than one year. Initially our experience was not good, after speaking with the center manager Joey, things get improved and our concern has been addressed., My kids have been going there since June this year and they love it! Bright and cheery environment with great teachers to keep the kids engaged all day. They love it!, All three of my children have attended Superland pre-school. The personalised loving service and value for money are the best in Singapore., the kindergarten is light, big and beautiful. There are 2 playgrounds (one indoor and one outdoor). The children and staff wear a mask all times, My son was able to eat on his own just after 1 week of school! Very happy and impressed with the teachers. Thanks for looking after my son., They got back to us the same day of our enquiry and even gave us a same-day tour! Bright and friendly staff, and what seems to be an excellent program., Teachers Nurul and Joey are great., Lovely & very pleasant pre-sch environment, Nice teacher and classroom! Strongly recommend!, good and securey, Our joined daughter superland BT when she was 18months until we relocated recently. All classrooms are very bright, cozy and clean, international teachers and children. My daughter loves all of the teachers and her classmates very much! Full of nurturing teachers and friendly helpful staff.  My daughter took care of me from 18 months to a year and a half. Compared to neighboring gardens, the spacious and bright windows and new facilities were very attractive. Although we live in an area where there are not many Japanese people, there was a 30-minute Japanese class taught by a Japanese teacher every day, and we had them create various events, songs, and productions for each season.  Since we were picking up and dropping off by car, it was nice that the park had plenty of parking space!"
Superland Pre-School (Ganges),"Principal Ms.Isabelle and all PG teachers are always smiling, friendly and approachable to children and parents, my gaughter loves to go school daily. Teacher Haidah and Siew ling are passionate and intelligent. Thank you all staff for taking such great care of our child., Excellent service by Teacher Amanda and would definitely recommend this place to my friends and colleagues, For the service I would give Zero star if i can . they got a very rude & poorly trained staff Amanda, Experienced teachers and engaging environment!"
Superland Preschool (Kreta Ayer),
Superland Pre-School (Outram),"Enrolled my 9 months old boy since 2020 with Jenna as the school principal. Infant care to playgroup experience was fine until we noticed he often came home with big mosquito bites mainly due to the school allowing the children to eat outdoors which have higher exposure to mosquitoes. Poor hygiene issues mainly also arise from the fact that they don‚Äôt shower the children after outdoor play. They only change clothes after play and the children sleeps sweaty. All the above issues caused ill health to my toddler. We withdrew our boy due to an incident of negligence whereby our boy was allowed to wear socks in the music room and he bumped his head with big bruises on the forehead. Our heart broke, and when we went to pick him up from Superland Outram, it was highlighted to us he have many ulcers at the back of his mouth again. This was the 3rd time our boy caught HFMD from Superland Outram. The doctor we visited suggested us changing the preschool after hearing our story. To conclude, I think the teachers here are fine but the school policies lacked proper supervision and maintenance. Hygiene and safety was a MAJOR reason why we pulled out. We were informed that the new principal is only working on part time basis. Our child‚Äôs attendance only met 5 to 7 days out of 25 days as the rest of the days are spent on us taking leave to look after a sick child. We requested for refund of deposit since 1st September 2022 and we have yet heard back from the school since. Post written on 19 October 2022. Good luck parents enrolling your child here., Pros: 1. The infant care teachers are caring and loving, my child loves to go school. I can leave my babe with teachers with no worries. 2. love the everyday outdoor play parts, children have the opportunity to explore under the sun and fresh air, and they have water play and sands play. 3. like the plenty of activities for the infants, like story telling, dancing, music, arts and crafts. 4. the teacher send the photos through apps quite frequently, it is very precious for parents to see what their kids are doing in the school. 5. like the personal touch with the teachers, you can feel the teachers really love the kids. Cons: 1. Infant care teachers turnover quite high, although I met few good teachers, my child always have to adapt to new teachers, school management shall pay more attention to keep the good teachers. 2. there are times i spotted big ants in the infant area, it might due to there is forest behind the school premise., Superland Outrum is a great school with loving teachers and principal. My son was in the school since 4 month old and was well taken care by his infant class teachers. I could go to work without worry. He then move on to PG and adapted well to the new class. His PG teachers are very loving, patient and fun. He blossom into an independent toddler and full of curiousity. He started singing and talking alot which I knew he leant from his teachers. He loves his teachers and friends. I especially loves the outdoor element in the school where my son gets lots of sunshine and play. Overall the school is good in their communication with parents and great teachers. We have to withdraw my son to join his elder sister in another school for more easier logistics. Would recommend this school to future parents., Just want to share my experience and raise awareness to whoever considering to send their children to this school.  I enrolled my Daughter to this school 2 years ago and within this time span, I moved her to a total of 4 different outlets hoping that they may be better but I was so wrong.  To think that sending your children to a private preschool may bring you more value, learning and development for your child, think again for this school as my child was mostly playing all the time and could not even get her basics right. It gets worse.  The Montessori is just a gimmick to earn more money for the school. I am not sure if the teachers are even properly trained as I feel they are very unprofessional and clueless, wonder how are they even qualified to be Teachers in the first place?  I had even witnessed an incident where officers came down for certain checks, and a few classes were brought elsewhere out of the office to ‚Äúhide‚Äù. Believe they could be unlicensed or had no carts. This was my last straw, to have a school doing such acts and shortchanging my child.  Isabelle and Danielle (owner and principal of the school) had always tried comforting me by saying that my child was in good hands, my foot. Just trying to make easy money is what both of them are good at. They are salespeople, the kinds you meet when engaging an ID or buying a secondhand car. All promises are made beforehand, and until you have made your purchase, that‚Äôs when your worst nightmare comes.  Conclusion, if you want to bring your children here, think twice. For the fees you are paying, I believe there are better schools out there. Even government schools are better in my opinion. Anyone has the same thoughts, feel the strong need to share this to everyone., Superland was the local neighborhood school, we used to love. We started our baby girl in Outram location and since moved to the Tiong Bahru Community Club location. Our baby girl is now K1 and we have seen the expansion of this once admirable school. The pursuit of profit takes a toll on teachers. Safety standards have been dropped. Our girl came back with a big bruise because the playground was not properly padded. They covered the cement with fake grass, that is it, no padding. This location is super secretive. They do not allow parents to enter and poke around. They don't even have a doorbell.  Education standards have also been dropped. Chinese curriculum is low. My girl tells me that she does drawings during Chinese lesson. The English teacher is part time and is balancing her schedule between two schools. We thought that the owner and principal care about the children. Now, I'm not so sure. She is likely to kick our kids out of the school for writing this. She thinks parent is the problem, whenever there is a dispute. However, I felt that parents have the right to know and participate in their child's education. This school is no longer transparent and dangerous, both on safety and education standards, sadly., My sons go to this pre-school.  I can take them to this pre-school with no worries.  Teaches are gentle and kind.  My sons enjoy pre-school life., Very happy so far with the facility and staff, excellent communications and we feel it‚Äôs a friendly place for kids, wonderful pre-school and teachers, One of the good choice, Children attend. When my child first started kindergarten, the teacher would send photos and messages to give me detailed information about my child's progress, which made me feel very at ease. We have many events, and recently we have started P.E classes and art classes, and the children seem to be having even more fun."
Superland Pre-School (Radin Mas),
Superland Pre-school (River valley),"Nice building and facilities but we only found out later how the teachers here treated the kids. My kids were scared of other schools‚Äô teachers because they thought all teachers would be the same and tell them off for everything. My son felt afraid to speak up in his new class because he thought his teachers would embarrass him just like they did in superland. During the parent teacher meetings I got little or no feedback - teachers seemed totally uninterested and didn‚Äôt really give me anything to take away. The facilities are great but they need proper teachers here not staff who are just killing time., This school continues to impress us as parents of a child in their infant care program. Although we joined in Covid times, the staff have helped our child gain confidence, learnt how to trust others and ultimately have become part of our support network. As parents we always feel well informed from diaper changes/ meal times notifications to health and safely protocols with Covid. Our child‚Äôs development has definitely improved as they are exposed to a creative environment which they wouldn‚Äôt necessarily get at home. Thank you for taking such great care of our child."
Superland Pre-School (Tanglin),
Superland Pre-school (TBCC),
Superland Pre-School (UE Square) Pte Ltd,"Grateful to have wonderful teachers like Zhao lao shi, Teacher Irenney and Teacher Jen as our daughter's teachers in PG class. They pay attention to her and provide feedback for us to help her at home. Consistency is key and I am also glad that we have similar views as to how best to help our daughter. Thank you xoxo, Our son has been attending Superland since he was 18 months old and we have been very happy with the teachers, facilities and the learning environment. The teachers do a wonderful job of taking care of the children while providing a safe and structured learning environment with lot's of opportunity for creativity and play. Superland has been a great choice for our son and I would highly recommend it to anyone looking for a Montessori school for their child., We had an excellent experience with Superland UE Square for both my son and daughter, who attended for several years.  It is a warm, professional and diverse environment with great care shown for the students.  My children are quite different in personality and both thrived there.  Thank you!, Our son has been at Superland since he was 20 months and has loved his experience. As parents we are also happy with how friendly and welcoming the staff is not only for the children but also the parents/caretakers. They keep us well informed of how he is doing and always are quick to check how he is doing if he is out sick. There is ample play as well as learning which is exactly what he needs at such a young age. Would definitely recommend for anyone looking for a fun, engaging preschool., The staff and teachers at Superland are true super heroes. Everyday we drop off our toddler with confidence knowing she is in excellent hands. The care, patience and attention for the children‚Äôs wellbeing and development is evident in every interaction ... and proven multiple times a week after pick up when our toddler asks to go back to school. Superland rocks!, The teachers at UE SQ are genuinely caring, patient & tactful. The staff takes effort in planning activities - sports days, Children‚Äôs Day, graduation concert. The experience is priceless!"
Swallows and Amazons Kindergarten,"I'd like say a big thank you to the SAA team. My son skipped out of his final session at Swallows a very proud and confident little boy. He has thoroughly enjoyed his time at SAA and that is largely due to the care and attention put in by all the teachers and support staff. They have all been brilliantly calm and patient and supportive from the beginning and, as such, we have really enjoyed seeing him develop during his time., My two sons have been going to Swallows and Amazons for more than two years and they are an exceptional organization. The teacher quality, the holistic approach to teaching and individualized learning is second to none. I  highly recommend this organization for your children. Thanks Simon, I couldn‚Äôt  recommend Swallows and Amazons highly enough for the genuine love of learning that they have instilled in our girls. With a diverse student body and a focus on play based learning the students always have fun., Ms Jeannette and Hudaüëçüëçüëç ‚Ä¶, Excellent teachers and inspiring learning journey!:), Refreshing"

The Kiddiwinkie Place (Env) Pte. Ltd.,
The Little House (Montessori),"I appreciate the quality of care, passion and education provided by Ms Katherine (principal) and the teachers. They do not solely focus on academic, they are also concern about the psychological development and social skills of our children. The children get to learn individually at their own pace and became more independent, patient and confident under the care of the school. They also love the excursions, geography lessons, cooking sessions and science experiments that are organised with great effort and care. Both my girls (7 & 10 yr old) still request to visit the school even after graduation which shows how much they have enjoyed their time there. Special thanks to Ms Katherine and her team for creating such wonderful learning experience for them., TLH is an outstanding preschool! I highly recommend it. The principal (Mrs. Katherine) is also the founder and owner of the school. This means that she has final say of how to run the school and sees ideas thru to implementation. It is extremely valuable to have consistent leadership. She anchors and ensures that the school is run up to her high standards and principles, and based on sound research of what is best for children. The children are taught to be socially aware, responsible and considerate. These and other good habits are inculcated from day one resulting in the school having a calm and cheerful atmosphere. It‚Äôs like a home away from home. The school motto is ‚Äúhelp me help myself‚Äù. There is a focus on confidence and initiative in the context of community. Mrs. Katherine is the model of a skilled and confident person. What better way to teach confidence than to exemplify it authentically! The teachers she selects are of high quality and quite a few have been at the school for many years. This means it‚Äôs a stable environment for the children. My child often tells me how much he loves interacting with his teachers. It is a language-rich environment and I have never heard the teachers speak bad English or Mandarin. This is a mixed age Montessori school. Older children are paired with younger ones and the kids learn social graces within community, not simply in theory. Older ones learn patience, leadership and kindness towards younger ones. Younger ones experience this and have confidence that one day they can in turn be in that role, rather than all children waiting on adults to serve them. All kids learn that they are active, useful and integral parts of their community thru everyday interactions. When I went for the school tour a few years ago, I was really caught off guard by 4 children coming up to me to see if I wanted a drink. They were going to pour water for me and host me! It is a true testimony as to how TLH respects children as individuals, believes in their abilities, and empowers them, to the point that the children were not unduly afraid of me, and saw it as their responsibility to host me, the guest in their school. I had visited 10 schools before deciding on this one and even my 1st runner up school is a far cry from what happened during my tour here. The other schools basically told the children to not disturb the adult talking with the principal and go do their own thing. Whereas at TLH, while no one interrupted the conversation, the children were instead encouraged to step up. They are not treated like a distraction to the ‚Äúreal work‚Äù that only adults do, but they are empowered to play key roles in the ‚Äúreal work‚Äù. Imagine the feeling of accomplishment and personal value they feel, and how eager they would be to step up and take initiative again! It shows me how the teachers view the children and their abilities, and natural opportunities that can be seized to build the kids up. To me, these are very well trained and intelligent teachers, and I would be safe to partner with them for my child‚Äôs learning journey. There is an individualised learning plan for each child. Academic lessons like math and reading are done 1-1. The fast learner does not have to sit in a bored classroom learning what he already knows. The slower learner does not have to feel shame and be discouraged to try their best. The kids abilities are intimately known by teachers because of this 1-1 interaction. There is cooking every week where the children themselves get to cook! One of life's greatest sensorial  experience. And they learn counting, fractions, mass and volume, chemical reactions, new vocabulary and all that academic stuff without even realizing it. Montessori schools are meant to be so much more than just Maria Montessori's materials. It is the entire ethos and community life, seeing thru children‚Äôs eyes and respecting them as valuable individuals. TLH is a Montessori par excellence., So far Katherine and her teachers are one of the best around. They were all Passionate and caring with kids. My boy learned and was well taken care by them, my boy used to be a very choosy eater but Katherine and her team managed to help him overcome his eating habits. All the best to TLH, Our girl joined The Little House's playgroup when she was only 1.5 years old. I was ready for a month of transition given the young age, but she adopted very quickly in merely a week. Not only the teachers have a wealth of experiences, they are organized and paid much attention to children's reaction and development. Thanks to that, we could pivot our approach of education in timely manner and it had help our daughter tremendously.  The teachers also took initiative and let us know that our daughter had shown signs that she was ready for toilet training. It is fascinating and reassuring that the teachers are attentive to the kids, dare I say more so than the parents given that we are 2 working parents...  I found overall the children of The Little House to be confident, well-mannered, gentle and creative. The Montessori approach was instilled not just through the tools, facility, or the program - it lives in their daily interaction with the kids.  This is the school you want your kids to go to., The Little House Montessori is the best environment we could possibly have found for our daughters.  Our eldest joined when we arrived in Singapore and took all of 20 minutes to settle in.  The environment, the teachers and the other students all form a virtuous circle in which our daughter has become responsible, curious, caring of others and brave in voicing her opinion and exploring new things.  Our youngest has just started there and is already thriving.  This school will have a huge positive impact on your child., When we moved to Singapore three years ago, we visited about 15 preschools before we chose the Little House Montessori for our eldest child. We are absolutely thrilled with our choice, and this year, our younger child also started at TLHM.  Each child has an individualised education plan, and the teachers are very tuned in to the needs and progress of every child. With their decades of combined experience, they provide a lot of support and advice around any developmental and behavioural issues that your child may face. Our children love the geography lessons, the science experiments, the weekly cooking, the play-based learning, and the structure they get at school. As parents, we love the wholesome (bilingual) environment, the wonderfully diverse student group, the excellent team of teachers and staff, and the inclusive community, all ably held together and led by the head directress, Mrs. Katherine. I especially appreciate the emphasis on good manners, the practical lessons in independence, the focus on the children‚Äôs physical development, and the language support given for non-native Mandarin speakers. This is an incredible place for children to spend their early formative years, and I highly recommend the Little House Montessori to anyone who wants to inculcate confidence and a love of learning in their child., Our first Son started with the Little House at the age of 18 months. After visiting more than 15  schools, it didn't take much thinking to decide on this one.  The teachers are hands-on with all the kids and the older children in the school are all well mannered and courteous (a sign they must be doing things quite well).  In proper Montessori style, they teach independence, value of community, behavior and life skills (the cooking every Thursday is the highlight for us). They keep the parents updated through regular newsletters, videos, photos about what the kids are learning during the day.  Definitely know where my second son will be going., My daughter spent one year at The Little House. Ms. Katherine and the teachers took extremely good care of the children, letting the kids be kids while attending to their psychological development, social skills and knowledge accumulation (to prepare for Singapore's notoriously competitive elementary school system). ... My daughter is now back in California but keeps telling me and her mom how much she misses her ""teachers and old friends"" at TLH.  ""I had a beautiful time!""  - that's her own summary of the TLH experience., If you're looking for a Montessori that has the best of everything - the classical Montessori environment and practices, a strong focus on the three Rs, a fun and energetic vibe, and more - The Little House Montessori is IT. What I loved the most was that they place a lot of importance on inculcating social graces and thoughtfulness in the children - saying please and thank you, forming and expressing their opinions politely yet effectively, taking turns, being fair, and so on. Children learn so much more than regular classroom stuff - cleaning their own plates and bowls after lunch, using various tools safely (such as scissors, punch machines, staplers, even the binding machine), cooking (and they share all the recipes with us at the end of the year!). The best part is how confident it makes the kids - all Little House kids I've met have this ""can-do"" attitude about everything.  Every week, they conduct Science experiments (and they deal with serious stuff: density, buoyancy, condensation...) and teach Geography (they tell the kids about a new country and what's really special about it).  Special mention must be made about Mandarin. My daughter joined TLH mid-year in N2, when we had just moved to Singapore. I was quite apprehensive about her having to deal with learning a new language along with everything else that was so new for her. Imagine my surprise (and relief!) when she soon started crooning in Mandarin! When I ask her who her favourite teacher is, most often she names Mandarin teacher that she names. Just to give an idea of how dedicated they are, during the first phase of the circuit breaker, the Mandarin teacher made detailed videos of writing and pronouncing each of the Chinese characters the kids needed to practise, which were so easy even for someone like me, with no knowledge of the language, to follow.  And the teachers are truly so, SO caring. I have personally witnessed how lovingly they handle very young kids who are anxious about leaving their mums to go off alone to school. There have been kids who have screamed and cried for the better part of a term or more, but the teachers would handle the situation with seemingly effortless calm. They're also an inclusive school; there have been kids with special needs, who join in the fun with everyone else, including the year-end concert.  I could go on and on. Long story short, though; if you're looking for a great school, Montessori or otherwise, for your 1.5 - 6 year old, you really must pay The Little House Montessori a visit., To the best of my observations, I notice some positive changes on my children, throughout their pre school development. 1. Bahavioral development. My children display satisfactory self-discipline and esteem. Meanwhile, willing to care for others. 2. Emotion management. They are able to express their emotion in a good way. They express and they control it. 3. Self-initiative. They are becoming independent in a way they learn to manage things themselves. Learnt to reduce redundancy and becoming much reliable.  Hereby, we, the parents of Max and Louise, would like to express our sincerest gratitude to the Principal Ms.Katherine and teachers and teams for the good work. We deeply appreciating your effort and passion. Wishing the school and teachers continue to grow and developing., Wonderful school! Our son spent his kindergarten years at The Little House Montessori, and it was a great start for his school education. The director and the teachers are passionate about their work and very dedicated. They organised all sorts of activities for the children so they could enjoy learning. Our son learned a lot, made good friends and became an enthusiastic learner, thanks to TLH!, I looked for some time to find an inclusive preschool in the West for my child with special needs, and The Little House Montessori exceeded all my criteria. Not only were they warm and accepting, the school was able to teach my son on an individualized basis. The Montessori curriculum was wonderful in developing his self-help skills as well as teaching kindness and consideration for others. The mixed age environment also meant that my son was able to be buddied by older pupils and interact with younger children, which was helpful for his social development. The door-to-door school bus service is also a huge positive and my son enjoyed taking the bus so much. My son loved going to school everyday, so thank you, Little House, for making his first school experience a positive one!, We were looking around Montessori schools in Singapore and did a lot of site visit. When we came to TLH and saw Ms Katherine, we know this is the school we can trust. My kids have been in TLH for 9 months. The teachers are very caring, observant, and resourceful. They also gave us much support when my kids started toilet training. My children particularly enjoy the thursday cooking session where they do everything from scratch. More importantly, the foods are delicious, and my kids feel proud of their work!, Our 2.5 year old son loved The Little House! We had a fantastic experience there - Katherine and the teachers were warm, attentive and extremely engaged. It was very clear that the kids welfare was always the #1 priority. We are now based in HK but would definitely pick TLH if we lived there., This was the first kindergarten I viewed after we moved to sunset area. I stepped in an old fashion glass door and got a warm welcome from Mrs Katherine. She enthusiastically walked me around while introducing how the classes would be carried out etc. We walked to the outdoor area, kids were happily playing in the small garden. There came a little girl, she saw me and came close to me. Before I realised, she poured me a glass of water from their snack station, where I saw a tray with couple of glasses stacking up, a jar of water and bananas neatly laying on top of it. That was it. I cancelled all appointments with other kindergarten and enrolled my boy.  My boy was then 4yr8month, he enjoyed going to TLH so much. Every week he told me a new science experiment; a new country with either its language or food; a new role-play with manner; oh yeah, a new goodie he made under the instruction of teachers. I was very impressed. The teachers made it all seemed so effortless, yet meaningful.  I remembered those days, parents gathered outside of the glass door where the kids lined up and got checked before going in school. Teachers welcomed kids with the brightest smile and funny talks. Mrs Katherine stood at her most comfy tree pose and chatted with us, we all started our days with lots of joy and laughter. Of course, most importantly, we knew our kids would have a wonderful school day at TLH.  How can I not mention the year end concert? It was fascinating. Nothing fancy but full of love and warmth. Teachers and kids designed their own stage, no one needed to wear special clothes or make-up. Kids chose what they most comfortable with and what they want to perform. They gave it their best on the stage. It was a pure joy for parents to see the how much their confidence have grown over a year. 2020, the pandemic hit. Teachers in TLH managed to gather all students single performing clips and created a long video. It was heartfelt. Still it seemed so effortless but meaningful.  We strongly recommend The Little House Montessori. It was the best decision to enrol our boy there. Everyday in his primary school life has benefitted greatly from his experience at TLH. Thank you all the lovely teachers in TLH., One of the best if not the best pre school in Singapore. Our son settled here so well, was cared for by lovely teachers and the school head Mrs Katherine. The focus on all rounded development is pretty sincere and that's what makes them much better than others. Our son not only learned phonics, writing and maths, he learned to be good and kind and we can't thank the school enough for that, I would like to extend my thanks to Mrs Katherine Sebastian of the Little House (Montessori) and her team of teachers for having done a good job of bringing up my two little ones, Zhi Rong and Jia Ning. I first chose this school, because, during the student visit, I was struck by the fact that the children were going about their studies, calmly and in an orderly manner, without any teacher screaming or raising their voice.  Both kids attended 4 years of kindy and nursery education. I am happy with the academic standards of The Little House (Montessori) as they prepare the child for up to primary 2 level of studies Zhi Rong has been doing well in Primary one and two, in Pei Hwa Presbyterian.  I am very appreciative of the close supervision and extra care the teachers took to look after my younger daughter. She was initially difficult and reluctant to learn. However, the teachers took the time to suss her out and managed to patiently coax her to apply herself, resulting in her catching up by the time she graduated from K2. We are confident she will not find primary one a struggle  Teachers do give feedback to parents on how their kids are doing, and work hand in hand with parents for the betterment of the children. I especially appreciate the occasional talks given by teachers and Mrs Katherine, on how the school teaches their mathematics and English Language. They even hold small get together talks on ‚ÄúHow to get your children to behave the TLH way‚Äù (You must attend this one!!)  Teacher turnover is low in this school, which helps the children feel they are in a safe and stable environment. I understand the school even sponsors teachers for higher learning!  If I had a third child, I would not hesitate to send him or her to this school. The teachers are dedicated, professional, knowledgeable. The principal is serious about educating the children and maintaining standards. More than once, I asked her about expanding her school but she won‚Äôt do it if it compromises the standards set.  A big thank you to Mrs Katherine Sebastian and the team that make up The Little House (Montessori). You helped to bring up my two kids.  Gratefully yours,  Han Chi Teng and Kelly Tan, The Little House was a home away from home to both my children (now aged 9 and 7, and in the Singapore school system). They spent their preschool years playing and learning in the wonderfully creative and nurturing environment of TLH, created by Katherine and her amazing staff of teachers. From rigorous Mandarin, Math and English, to cooking, dancing, plays, games, unbelievably fun school bus rides and more, TLH played a huge role in their development, instilling confidence, empathy and resilience that will hopefully last them for many years to come. As a University educator myself, I cannot speak more highly of the learning environment at TLH - it is indeed a model that I sometimes wish we had the chance to follow even in tertiary education! I am eternally grateful to TLH for playing such a big role in my children‚Äôs early lives, and cannot recommend it highly enough!, TLH review  A truly special place with heart, soul and an extraordinary crew of teachers! I visited a number of pre-schools while searching for a school for my first born and stopped searching the moment I visited TLH. It‚Äôs amazing how organised the school is; everyone seems to know exactly where to go and what to do at any point in time. Mrs Katherine runs a tight (and extremely effective) ship at TLH - clearly a woman on a mission!  Things I love about TLH:  - I love how the children are treated with respect, allowed to be responsible for themselves and others from a young age. They are encouraged to be individuals with unique personalities, strengths and weaknesses. There is no rote learning in this school; every child gets to play, explore and learn at their own pace. They‚Äôre taught to be respectful of mother nature and to be kind and empathic towards the needy.  - I love how my kids come home happy every day, with tales of how they‚Äôve enjoyed learning about different countries and cultures from geography class, working with magnets during science class, singing about planets and continents at circle time, baking and cooking on Thursdays and most of all, fun times with their friends at the sandpit during outdoor play.  - The birthday celebrations I‚Äôve attended at TLH are some of the most meaningful celebrations I‚Äôve ever been to. Instead of focusing the celebration around singing the obligatory ‚Äúhappy birthday‚Äù song and cake cutting, the teachers takes time to talk about the birthday child, from the time the child is in his mother‚Äôs womb to his milestones and achievements over the years, and the number of times the child has orbited around the sun.  - I love how the annual year-end concert is organised as an intimate affair which prioritises the child‚Äôs learning process over the end product. No sleek venues, costly costumes or over-rehearsed performers. Instead, every child get to contribute, from creating the backdrop and props to choosing the item they‚Äôd like to perform.  My younger child has recently started attending TLH as well, shortly after his 2nd birthday. I‚Äôm pleased to see how quickly he has adapted to the new environment and how he has grown in confidence, social and physical awareness since starting school at TLH., Our daughter has attended two other pre-schools prior to The Little House, so we can confidently say that this place is truly special. It is a tight-knit community of outstandingly committed teachers with very low turnover (a problem at many other pre-schools!) and a lovely multicultural mix of students. We also love the school's premises - an airy main room with open doors and windows to the garden and playground, as well as dedicated areas for various purposes.  We did not choose this school specifically for the Montessori method, but after witnessing this unique and extremely effective approach to learning we are convinced that this is one of the best ways to build a strong foundation and guide young children into the world of reading, writing and understanding numbers. Every child receives one-to-one attention and is allowed to learn at his or her individual pace. At this school, learning is made fun which in our opinion is the best gift you could give to your child. As a result, we are extremely confident that our daughter will have no problems whatsoever with the transition to primary school. In fact, her reading, writing and maths skills are above average for her age. Another strength of the school is the Mandarin programme which is conducted by native Chinese teachers. We have been thoroughly impressed with the advanced level of our daughter's Mandarin which she picked up solely at this school. The reason why I am emphasizing all these is not because I am overly concerned with her academic performance (not at this young age anyway), but because I have heard some other parents being worried about whether a pre-school with such strong Montessori philosophy would be a good preparation for local primary school. The answer is absolutely yes! In fact, Singapore needs many more schools like Little House!  The curricular activities are rounded off by attention to character development and conveying a strong sense of community and teamwork to the children. Then there are the many wonderful traditions at the school that we have come to cherish over the years - the birthday walk, show & tell, Thursday's cooking class, the yearly Deepavali field trip to Little India (amongst many other regular field trips) and many more. We are fortunate to have discovered Little House, a true gem in the Sunset Way neighbourhood, and are already looking forward to enroll our second child in the 2017 intake., We wish we had found this place sooner! We moved our son to TLH in June 2016 during his K1 year after his previous school shut down and it has been an amazing journey for him and for us as parents since he started here. Despite his difficulty with adapting to change, our son transitioned to TLH with remarkable ease, owed largely due to the creative teaching methods TLH uses. Their teachers put in a lot of effort into tailoring the curriculum to each child's individual learning capability. In under a year,  our mostly English and partly Hindi speaking son was conversing fluently enough in Mandarin to defend himself if accused of a misdemeanor! The day is a good mix of dual language teaching and playtime, and the weekly sash races and cooking sessions were quite a highlight for our son. One of the things that makes TLH unique is their headmistress Katherine. Kind, funny and incredibly good at running this school, she has a wonderful way with the children and brings together children, teachers and parents alike to develop a wonderful community atmosphere. We were sorry to leave TLH for the inevitable move to P1. Highly recommended., All my three children went to The Little House (Montessori), and we all love and miss it so much! Years after entering primary school, my children‚Äôs best friends are from TLH, and several of the families have become family friends.  TLH is a true-blue Montessori school that focuses on all aspects of a child‚Äôs development:  physical, intellectual, language, emotional and social. Each of my children received the attention they needed in the areas where they needed it. Eg. Child no. 1 had to learn to deal better with setbacks, and not lose her temper. Child no.2 needed speech therapy because she was not correcting her mispronunciations even with extra help. Child no. 3 had to learn to share with peers and take turns graciously.  Chinese is an organic part of TLH. My children came home talking about a dessert they had sampled from ""Â¢®Ë•øÂì•"" (Mexico), talking about a science experiment that È©¨ËÄÅÂ∏à had shown them as well as an obstacle course where they had to Áà¨ËøáÊ°• (climb over the bridge). Learning to read was so effortless I did not hear about it, until they started pointing out random words they could recognise on billboards or tv subtitles: ‚ÄúMummy, that is ‚ÄúÊù•‚Äù, that is ""Êàë""!""  All three of my children were able to transition easily into primary school. Academically, they were at or above the standard required for primary one. But more importantly, each child took responsibility for their own learning, and took pride in their work. Even when tired and frustrated, each child took pains to finish their work to the best of their ability. Child no. 1 cried as she struggled to finish her math homework, but she stuck it out, working out each answer without guessing. Child no. 3 whined when he to re-write several words in the dreaded Stellar handwriting workbook, but a simple, ""what would your current teacher/Ms Katherine/Kristine/Mrs Jo say?"", were enough to spur him on. Child no. 2 continues to finish her homework independently, something she had done since P1.  Socially and emotionally, each child was able to make the leap from a warm, cosy and loving preschool to the much larger and anonymizing primary school. They were confident in managing all the different tasks: making new friends, choosing and buying food from the canteen, being part of a large class of 30 silently copying information from the white board.  My oldest is now in secondary school, and continues to blossom, I‚Äôm sure in part due to the 3.5 formative years she spent in TLH where she learnt positive habits of independence/self-help, care for others, responsibility and self-discipline. She is able to whip up a delicious meal for the entire family plus guests, due to the love of cooking she developed in TLH. (The weekly Thursday cooking lessons at TLH are legendary! Parents of multiple children look forward to certain dishes, in particular, the chocolate truffle!)  TLH feels like a family. There is very low staff turnover. Many of the teachers taught all three of my children, and my children always look forward to going back for visits. Mrs Katherine Sebastian has created a preschool that combines fun with responsibility, love with discipline, bound together with a lot of warmth and friendship., My Daughter started at TLH when she was 2.5 years old. It was only by pure luck that I found the school (like most foreigners, I left the school application to the very last minute) and managed to secure the last slot. I feel very blessed that my Daughter had many happy years at TLH. At that time she was going through potty training and unlike most children, she was not embarrassed or uncomfortable with having ""accidents"" at school all the time. The Teachers were so fantastic in helping me with her pottty training and not once did they complain or grumble. I don't know any school that could be more caring and patient with my child.  The children at TLH are guided to be independent and taught how to use a scissors correctly at a young age. And under supervision, they are taught cooking and the safe way to use a small knife or peeler. My Daughter is now 5 and she constantly helps out with the dinner preparation at home. Thanks to TLH she knows how to use these sharp objects safely and correctly.  Each child progresses at their own pace so their is no pressure to keep up with someone else. They are taught such a wide range of subjects such as language, reading, Maths, science, cooking and geography. And all this is done in a fun and relaxed way that is easy for a child to understand. I cannot count the number of times I am pleasantly surprised when my Daughter comes home with knowledge such as being able to name all the continents or telling me all about Pluto, the dwarf planet! My Daughter learnt more Chinese at TLH than she did at an external enrichment centre. And later on when I engaged a private Chinese tutor for her, it was TLH that helped me find her. I find that the Teachers are always accessible and ready to help with any issues that I have. They have a good library of resources that enable me to guide my child at home with her studies. Even when I have questions about non-school related issues such as Behavioural problems, they are always willing to listen and guide me.  My Daughter has unfortunately moved on to a good international school a couple of months ago. I didn't have a choice as she was offered a place and both my Husband and I are not locals. Because of the high standards at TLH, her writing, reading and Maths level surpassed that of other children in her class. In fact, she often has to help her classmates with their writing.  I'm not sure if it's pure chance or if TLH is selective but I have not met a parent at TLH that I do not like. All the parents are very friendly and supportive, and I have made some very dear friends during my daughters time there.  Most importantly, TLH has molded my Daughter into a wonderful person. Through TLH, she has learnt to say please and thank you. She learnt to say excuse me and wait her turn to speak. She learnt that smoking is bad. She learnt to be polite and gracious. These are only a fe of the examples amongst many more. I can spot a TLH child at a party. All the TLH children are polite and wait for their turn to have a slice of cake. TLH children do not poke the birthday party or demand their share. In fact, because she is taught to do so at TLH, my Daughter always serves everyone before she has her slice of cake.  To summarise, TLH, as locals would say, ""spoil market only"". TLH is so great that no other school compares to it, not even close.  Note: TLH has a fantastic catered lunch too, with healthy yet delicious options and the Teachers were very kind to help me keep track of how much my child ate., This is a lovely Montessori school! Teachers are all patient, kind and warm. First school that I truly trust.I love how they can teach manners as well as  life skills, and of course study with individual development. Both my kids love the little house!, Awesome Preschool!  I have 3 kids and only my youngest attended TLH. I have always tell people that TLH is really the best Pre School I have ever encountered.  Katherine is such an enthusiastic educator, she has the best team of educators I have seen before. My child have gone from a timid and shy person to a outgoing, confident and learned child. You have to try to believe!, We sent our daughter here for four years and we would unhesitatingly recommend it to any parent looking for a superb, well-balanced environment for their children.  The staff are truly well-trained, and genuinely warm and caring. With the Montessori method, the children are given individual attention and learn at their own pace in a fun environment. The method ensures that each concept is firmly grasped before the child moves onto the next topic -- nothing is forced onto the child before he/she is ready. I was impressed with the high standards of Mandarin taught and as far as math, reading and writing are concerned, I have no doubt my child will breeze through most of Primary 1.  The children are not coddled; they're encouraged to be curious, to figure things out themselves, and to ask if they have questions. Children are introduced to different countries and cultures. They learn to cook little dishes. They build confidence with their weekly show-and-tells, and the open mic at the year-end concerts. If there are playground arguments, they are taught to express their feelings and resolve issues politely. They do science experiments; I was very pleasantly surprised to have my six-year old talk to me about condensation and evaporation. They're encouraged to go out and play and climb and they're taught it's fine to fall down and get a little sweaty and dirty.  We loved the multiculturalism in the school; on one occasion, when the kids were taught how to react when they are unable to catch what someone has said, they role-played the situation in English and Mandarin, and one of the kids covered it in French, which I thought was awesome. The high teacher-to-student ratio ensured that teachers were able to give each child individual attention and form close, nurturing relationships.  We also liked their involvement with charities. It gave the kids an opportunity to learn that it is a privilege to be able to help the less fortunate, and gave the parents an opportunity to support those in need.  The school will provide a firm foundation for further education but what we think makes it stand out, and what we are most grateful for, is the time spent teaching the children self-confidence, self-control, respect for others and social etiquette. For example, one of the (many) lessons was about how to interrupt a conversation politely, another involved teaching the children how holding the door open is a polite and thoughtful act. The school considers social skills an important part of a child's development, and I have noticed that kids from The Little House Montessori are generally polite, kind, respectful and well-adjusted, while still maintaining their own individual, independent personalities.  We cannot thank Katherine and the other teachers at The Little House Montessori enough for what they have done for our child., Both our boys enjoyed  their time in Little House tremendously. I was very impressed that they were   taught various life skill as part of their curriculum . The teachers and principal were genuinely sincere and caring about the students, even after they have graduated. The Little House has prepared my two boys extremely well for their Primary school life., Best preschool in Singapore.  Highly recommended. My daughter and twin sons went to this school and they totally enjoyed it. The students there are culturally diverse and are taught the right values and skills to well equip them for primary school life.  Absolutely warm and fantastic staff as well., Our son Jesse has been in this fantastic establishment for over 4 years. The warmth and professionalism of the staff really is a joy and Jesse loves to go to school everyday. I have been particularly impressed by the multi-cultural integrity of the school, and the genuine commitment and enthusiasm of all the teachers and proprietor to engage and help each student individually.The end of year school performance each year is a true highlight!!!! It will be a sad day in a few weeks time when he moves on, but sure he will cherish the memories of his time in this very special place, and we, as parents would warmly recommend to any prospective students/ parents., Both my children have been at The Little House since they were 2.5 years old and it has been the best decision I have ever made as a parent.  Ten Things I love about The Little House (Montessori)  1. My kids are ALWAYS excited to go to school, and they are always happy when they come home.  2. My kids have rarely been sick since they started. Compared to being in day-care centres before, I can count on one hand the number of sick days my kids have taken.  The space is airy and the children have an outdoors play area. They are allowed to be kids and get dirty, play in grass, in sand, bounce on the trampoline, ride bicycles, play pretend, climb on monkey bars. They don't spend all their time washing hands like in day-care-centres, but are taught proper common sense hygiene.  3. TLH is like an extension of our home. There is a VERY low turnover rate with teachers and so the children feel very safe and secure at school.  4. It is always calm. With 50 -60 kids doing different activities at different times, you would often imagine chaos. But in all the times that I have been at the school, peeked through the glass doors, the school environment has always been very calm and the children are often busying themselves with something.  5. Katherine - the principal of the school leads by example and is personally involved in every child's development. She is the heart of the school and the children and teachers make up the soul.  6. TLH has a wonderful network of parents and alumni. Ex-students are often seen at the school functions and end-of-year concerts. School events are so much fun.  7. Best end-of-year concerts. The first part of the concert is like an open mic event, where kids get to choose with whom they perform with, and what they do. The teachers then help them arrange that. The second part will usually be a play where all props and backdrops are made by the older kids. The last part is always a song where the kids all sing together. This is usually when I start tearing up. The concert is held within the school and lunch is served after. Parents are invited to potluck, so it is really like a huge party for the kids and parents.  8. Cooking is a life skill taught to the children once a week. I run a business teaching people to cook, so this is something that I think is dear to my heart. Younger kids get help in the kitchen, with cutting/slicing. As they get older, they are able to manage the prep more independently. My girls are always excited and proud of themselves when they bring their cooked food home.  Even if the food isn't always quite edible, it is a great exercise to get the kids used to. We all have to start somewhere and it is really okay if your biscuits turned out like rocks, or if your sweet and sour dish is more sweet than sour - it's all part of the learning process. All recipes are put on a calendar that the school produces every end of the year. This calendar is customised to have your child's face on the front cover, so it is a great keepsake and gift to grandparents who live overseas.  9. Flexibility. The school is very flexible to accommodating children/parents request. As the school owns the school bus, they are able to be flexible with pick up and drop off requests. Whenever possible, they always try to help parents with playdate drop offs.  10. Method. I think the method that is implemented at the school is extremely well thought through and works. The school is always on top of what each child is doing, and their overall development and progress. Parent Teacher Conferences are held twice a year. If we have any questions, Katherine's door is ALWAYS open for a chat or update.  My oldest daughter graduated from The Little House last year and is now in Primary 1. She was able to transition easily because of the self-discipline and independence instilled into her at TLH when it comes to learning. She understands that they is time for work, and time for play.  I really recommend TLH as a preschool to be your child's home away from home., Sent both my kids here. It's a great school that embraces diversity. It's important that our children interact with peers with different needs. Besides preparing the children academically for primary school, TLH also creates space for children to grow in confidence. They teach soft skills explicitly e.g. role-playing appropriate behavior for different settings, and get children to practise them too e.g. washing of plates, looking after the younger children esp on fieldtrips. Both my kids grew in confidence in TLH and enjoys things like real cooking, weekly show and tell, climbing outdoors. This is a true Montessori school. It's also great that the school brings in extra curricular activities like aikido and music so we don't need to send the children for enrichment ourselves., I like to thank you, Katherine and the teachers for grooming Ellie well. My gratitude üòä  To Share:-, Dear TLH, When we first started@TLH, we only had a three-year old and being returning singaporeans, we heard about TLH through a friend who homeschools her kids (she heard wonderful stories about TLH from a friend).   When Qi first started, you had asked me this, ""Did you notice that when she runs, she tip-toes? "" Your montessori-trained teachers observe keenly!¬† i was embarrassed that as a mother,¬† i have no clue that she does that!  Having 4 kids allow us the opportunity to experience TLH longer. Our family enjoy especially the annual year-end concert.¬† It is, in my opinion, a concert like no other school concert - the children come first rather than the performance (yet we were thoroughly entertained and every year,¬† TLH took the effort to make a different backdrop :)!¬† ). There are no grand hotels and thousand-dollar tickets, only a community that chipped in to bring what they have to share. It is good that the preparation for the concert lasted for only a couple of weeks; children are not performers and ThankU for keeping them that way.  The teachers you hire are of exceptional calibre: their linguistic capability is a quality that we may not get in every community. Little children's absorbent minds hear the language spoken properly and in turn, they articulate the language correctly too.  ThankU for being firm to the little ones in a gentle, loving manner; there is no shouting, only reminding them the right way of doing things. This is where I wonder if it's the methodology or the school setting - perhaps TLH can share with interested parents how this can be done at home! Sincerely,  Jeanne Anne Hsi , mummy of Qi, Rui,¬† Luo & En , My daughter graduated from this school last year. We loved it! All teachers have been warm and caring. Thanks Katherine for your help and support!, As always, I m grateful to Ms Katherine and her team for its hardworking, dedication and flexibility to accommodate each kids (Ellie and Elyn) learning needs. Thank you very much üòä ‚Ä¶, Very professional, In my child's kindergarten, the principal and teachers are very loving and responsible. The school has a complete teaching system and high-quality courses. My children learned a lot of knowledge, and the language environment of Chinese and English helped my children grow up very quickly., 2 years ago, I moved to a community near TLH, so I sent my son to this school nearby. Because my son in the previous kindergarten was very resistant and unhappy. When I learned that this school would have many game activities, I immediately signed up. Name, after these two years of study, I found that my son‚Äôs abilities in all aspects have been greatly improved, especially his self-learning ability. He actually used the piano APP to learn many courses by himself. He has just turned six years old and makes his mother very proud. , I firmly believe that this has a great impact on the educational guidance of the school. This is the best decision I have made in the short 5 years in Singapore. Now we are moving to other countries. I hope my message will be helpful to you. This school is really great. The principal is very professional. If you talk to her, you will understand. They started in 1995 and have accumulated a lot of teaching experience over the years. The teachers are also very fixed and do not change often. This ensures teaching experience and quality. The inheritance of ideas., My second daughter, who is 5 years old, and my eldest son, who is 2 years old, attend this school. They have been attending the school for over 2 years and for over 5 months, respectively. It's a very good kindergarten. I believe that children's independence and expressiveness are fostered through the daily support of teachers and Montessori-based education. I don't have to worry about English because I am learning phonics. We also have Chinese lessons. When a friend asks me about kindergartens in Singapore, I have no hesitation in recommending The Little House, and the biggest reason for that is the sense of security. You can see everywhere that the principal, who is full of kindness and passion, and the teachers with a wealth of experience are paying close attention to each child. This includes the school bus to and from kindergarten. In addition, the individual activity PDFs (with photos) sent regularly are very useful for understanding the atmosphere at the kindergarten and as an opportunity to talk with the children about daily life at the kindergarten. I would like to keep it digitally. Before enrolling, I visited several kindergartens, but I am so grateful that I found The Little House., It's a very good kindergarten. I also visited other kindergartens, but I was really drawn in by the humanity of the principal here. Also, the other teachers are all experienced teachers. The way you look at and watch over your children is wonderful. One of the deciding factors was the excited expressions on the children's faces when we went on the tour. My eldest daughter attended the school for about 2 and a half years, and my youngest son went there for about 8 months. During that time, there were times when I was worried about my child, but having a reassuring teacher made me feel at ease. For the past year and a half, events have been restricted due to the coronavirus, but the events held at schools before the coronavirus were also very wonderful. I decided to try Montessori without knowing much about it. I felt that the warm and friendly atmosphere of the nursery school was a place where children could live their lives to the fullest. My parents and I both love The Little House., When I was assigned to work in Singapore, I toured 20 kindergartens for my 3-year-old daughter and decided on TLH Montessori. Although it is a small kindergarten, I was attracted to the principal's passion and educational policy, and when I talked with him, I thought he would take great care in developing the children's talents, so I decided to join him. As a result, my daughter has grown rapidly and continues to make remarkable progress in her areas of expertise. Maybe that's a good thing because you'll be placed in a vertically divided environment regardless of your grade level. The principal, Katherine, and all the other teachers are always cheerful and sometimes strict with the children. I definitely want to send my second daughter here too."

The Little Skool-House International Pte Ltd (At-Marina-Boulevard),
The Little Skool-House International Pte Ltd (At-Ministry-of-Education),"After interacting with the school staff, I feel compelled to share my perspective. In just three weeks of starting in a new school, my kids have experienced exceptional care and attention to detail from the teachers and admin staff.  The dedicated teachers gave prompt and useful feedback and were quick to address any of our concerns. Even the admin staff, while primarily focused on admin duties, is also incredibly friendly and display plenty nurturing qualities, easing my children's initial fears of school.  Notably, my daughter, who usually fears strangers, readily accepted the comforting presence of the admin staff. The transition from fear to genuine enthusiasm for school speaks volumes about the positive atmosphere the staff created.  The principal is a standout leader, embodying sound educational values and leads by example. She is actively on the ground supporting her staff throughout the day. The chaotic mornings seamlessly transform into a calm and well-organized reception for the kids. You can see that she is not only brilliant in what she does, but she does it with plenty of passion and conviction.  Having explored over 40+ preschools, we are confident in our decision to choose this one. The combination of caring and competent teachers, supportive admin staff, and a principled leader makes this school exemplary. We eagerly anticipate many more years of our kids thriving in this nurturing educational environment., I am writing to express my strong dissatisfaction with the recent experience I had with your institution, Little Skool House MOE. Approximately six months ago, I initiated the process of scheduling a school visit and enrolling my child in your school through your official website. Unfortunately, my interactions with your staff have left me deeply disappointed.  Upon following your institution‚Äôs instructions to book a visit through your website, I submitted numerous emails and online appointment requests, but to my dismay, I received no response whatsoever. This lack of communication and engagement with prospective parents is unacceptable and has caused significant frustration.  Furthermore, when I made a phone call to your institution to seek clarification and confirmation, I was met with an impatient and discourteous attitude. I was informed in a rather dismissive manner that the school had reached its maximum capacity and was no longer accepting new students. To make matters worse, the staff member I was speaking with abruptly ended the call when I attempted to seek further clarification.  While I understand that your school may be in high demand, it is essential to treat all prospective parents with respect and provide them with a response, whether or not enrollment slots are available. Failing to do so is a disservice to parents who are genuinely interested in your school and willing to invest their time and effort in the application process.  I urge you to implement measures to improve your response time and communication with prospective parents, regardless of the current enrollment status. Your institution should aim to provide a welcoming and respectful experience for all potential students and their families."
The Little Skool-House International Pte Ltd (At-Mountbatten-Square),"The Chinese teacher did not allow my child to use the toilet because she believed that no one would need to pee within 10-15 min after using the toilet after lunch, and assumed that my child was only going to the toilet to avoid taking a nap/wanted to play in the toilet. Yet, the Chinese teacher didn‚Äôt bother to give my child the benefit of the doubt or even bothered to follow my child to the toilet to check if my child was indeed lying (or not). And the student to teacher ratio that time was very low. My child hence had to endure and wet the bed SEVERAL TIMES until we were worried there was a bladder/kidney issue as my child has been off diapers for 1 year. The English teacher was physically there but soul hasn‚Äôt followed her to work, and while planning to surprise our child, we actually heard her scolding and punishing our child unfairly., My two boys went to the school since toddler class and love the school so much! Very friendly and caring principal and teachers, who know every kid at school. My elder one cried non stop on his last day at school after graduation. We will miss the school a lot., I was urgently looking for an infant care around my housing area and usually in such short notice, most schools wouldn‚Äôt have any vacancy. So I approached LSH(being one of our first few choices as it is Sparks accredited) and the admin, Ying Zheng, was very prompt in her replies. Understanding my urgency and situation, she assisted me throughout and attended to my requests. The teachers were friendly and very informative, facilities are clean and organised, we were excited to get our girl started! However we had to withdraw her on a last minute due to a personal reason. Ying Zheng was still very understanding and professional in handling our issues and we‚Äôd be very grateful for her.

The Little Skool-House International Pte Ltd (At-Outram),"Excellent childcare... I would rate it 6 out of 5 stars! Great teachers, easy check in check out process. The teachers there make it a point to call the kids there by name even those not directly under their charge.  They have got a great principal - Marie Luo. She really makes it a point to engage and interact with parents and provide updates opportunistically.  My son has a great playgroup year with teacher Mista and teacher Hua! They really helped him adapt to school life. He was initially very shy and afraid to go to school but they really helped to ease him in.  In N1, teacher Mista and teacher Zhou helped me to really improve his linguistic skills.  in N2, teacher Estelle was excellent. She always provide timely updates and made sure that Titus is comfortable in school. His social and language skills really skyrocketed! My son actually enjoys going to school and would miss school - I think that is a great testament to how good his teachers are.  Currently in K1, he continues to improve under teacher Estelle. He got teacher Jia Jia as his Chinese teacher and now he really enjoy Chinese and his fluency in speaking Mandarin has really improved!  In summary, it is a great pre-school and easy recommendation."
The Little Skool-House International Pte Ltd (At-Republic-Polytechnic),
The Little Skool-House International Pte Ltd (At-Tampines-Junction),"Actually my kid rated this school 5 out of 10 after he left. I think the problem lies with the teachers. Most of the teachers are not very well trained. Concepts like 'reward for efforts rather than results' or 'growth mindset' seem unfamiliar with them.  I heard my boy once mentioned that Laoshi said if he could not do something well, he would be punished. Overall, I don't think it is worthy of my money., Very good childcare centre"
The Little Skool-House International Pte Ltd (At-Temasek-Polytechnic),"Placed my child on the school‚Äôs ECDA waitlist as well as contacted the school personally.  I was informed via email that vacancy priority will go to the children of Temasek Polytechnic‚Äôs staff which I fully concurred with, seeing that this school is located in the school‚Äòs premise itself. Was told to fill up a form to be placed on the waitlist which I did, and there were no other exchange of emails. I emailed the school about 6 weeks later in the afternoon just to check roughly how many children are ahead of my boy in the waitlist, so as to have a better sense of whether I should continue waiting or perhaps commit to another school further away. Approximately one hour after sending the email, my husband forwarded to me a message notification stating that my child‚Äôs interest in little skool house at TP has been removed by the centre citing no vacancy. Naturally, I was appalled and was wondering what are the odds of this being a mere coincidence? I went back to my email wondering whether I have missed out any emails but nope, nothing was sent to me. I called the school and the principal Ivy answered. She told me it was a mere coincidence and that she herself was the one who amended the ECDA list and removed him. And I was told not to worry, as despite the fact that she personally removed him from the wait list, my child remained on their personal wait list and that once again, priority goes to TP staff but they‚Äôll contact me again if there is any vacancies. This baffles me completely because it‚Äôs as good as telling me that HDB has removed us from the ballot list for a BTO house, but not to worry as they have a private list which we are supposedly still on. I told the principal that it  was a very simple question. We are all adults here. Even if you can‚Äôt answer due to privacy issues, there is no need to be so passive aggressive in your action. Say I buy your story that it was sheer coincidence. Can you tell me roughly where my child is on the waitlist? And as usual, I was reiterated that TP‚Äôs staff have priority, that she despite being the principal can‚Äôt give me an answer unless she opens another class, that she can‚Äôt reveal or say anything. I was disappointed nonetheless and hanged up the phone. After which I received 3 missed calls and an email from an admin stating that she will be on leave the next day and that she will contact me via email the following day. I responded to that email citing that a waitlist only serves to exist purely because there is no vacancy in the school isn‚Äôt it? Why remove my child from the waitlist after asking us to fill up a form to join the waitlist and then cite ‚Äúno vacancy‚Äù as your reason for removal. Have all the other kids born in 2021 also been personally removed from your ECDA‚Äôs wait list (but still remained on your private wait list then)? Does it even make sense? And not surprisingly, I did not receive any email replies to my question following the staff‚Äôs one day leave. With such staffs, poor communication and questionable principal overlooking the school, there is no way I would ever trust my child to be left in their hands. Such passive aggressive action shouldn‚Äôt be coming from a preschool principal herself in a setting where I‚Äôm supposed to entrust that my child is going to be taught good values and virtues at. I won‚Äôt even go so far as to recommend this school to my enemy‚Äôs children. Should issues arise down the road, as a parent who am I supposed to turn to?  Edited: I finally received an email reply from the school today (7 days later). On the evening of the morning that I posted this review. Sheer coincidence again? It‚Äôs anyone‚Äôs guess., Nice childcare. Good staff and infrastructure"

Well doneüëç ‚Ä¶, Baby boy gets good exposure to different ages of friends in Playgroup :) Teachers are friendly and we believe baby boy is in good hands with them., My Child was badly scratched, bruised, and bitten on THREE occasions within SIX MONTHS in this Childcare. The teachers and principal did nothing to prevent bullying from happening in their childcare. They show nonchalant attitude towards all injuries during school hours, brushing it off by saying it is inevitable that such incidents happen.  Incident 1: My daughter's face was badly scratched by a boy from the same class. Teacher's excuse: The boy was undergoing mood swing therefore it happen.  Incident 2: My daughter's hand was bitten by a girl from the same class. There are visible wounds with bite marks on her hand. Teacher's excuse was that they are just playing and such incidents are inevitable. My daughter said she was pushed and bitten and called for help but her teachers did not stop the girl from biting her.  Incident 3: My daughter's face was again badly scratched and bruised with 3 visible wounds. Incident happened between 4pm to 5pm. Teacher again did not call to inform. Their excuse: Since parents is fetching them soon, they do not see the need to call to inform. (I fetch my daughter at 6pm).  To the principal Ms Sylvia, if you are reading this: Please establish a clear set of process and conduct for your teachers to follow. It is no coincidence that your childcare had so many cases of child injuries under your management.  To all potential parents: Do re-consider enrolling your child into this childcare centre.  I am happy to provide evidence and proof for everything I have written above.  Update Feb-2023: I have transferred my daughter to another childcare and can see a big difference in the care and attention provided by teachers and staff in her new childcare.  Update Jul-2023: 7 months after I wrote this review, Ms Silva called me and request to remove my review.

Curriculums and activities are all well planed in place in developing the kid in all areas. External lessons like art ,speech and drama, robotics are available too. Teachers are all very committed and responsible, caring, patient and kind. Very Fast and responsive too. Most of the teachers had been with the school for many years and maintained very good relationship with the parents. Miss Hema, the principal had been there for more than 10 years. She is the best that I have ever known. Very committed to providing the best to kids, planed and managed the whole school with the well being of kids as her top priority. Friendly and caring to everyone. And she can remember every single kid names and their parents! Overall, excellent preschool experience for both of my kids!

Indeed, the school has been a vibrant, loving and fun learning place for my child and her classmates. Our child looks forward to going to school everyday and enjoys a loving, warm relationship with her teachers and classmates.  There are very interesting and well conducted enrichment courses within school curriculum hours (our child especially loves the Artsy Bugsy classes and Speech and Drama ) as well as special holidays program in June and December ( Dance, robotics, Science, baking , yoga etc).  My child also enjoys the monthly water play in their own private ankle height pool.  Ms Hema, the Principal, is a gem and leads a superb team of teachers and staff. There is prompt update of curriculum, students‚Äô well being and pictures of children and activities.  Communication has always been forthcoming and prompt with the teachers and school management.  The teachers have prepared my child well academically ( English curriculum is by Morris Allen, Chinese curriculum by Tian Hsia) and in her life skills ( e.g toilet training, self care, positive education).  My child, Mikaela, loves her teachers, Teacher Jade and Bo Lao shi.  We were fortunate that the school also has a very convenient school bus service and the School Bus Uncle and Auntie, Uncle Joe and Aunty Jenny, are so caring and patient with children.

The principal is very thoughtful and detailed in understanding parents need. The teachers are very caring and always share their perspectives on our kids and thus enhancing our understanding of our kids more.  Kiddos to the teachers and principal!, My son spent K1 and K2 in Orange Tree. A great preschool with strong curriculum and good teachers and principal who cared for his wellbeing and development. Besides classes, there are also fun activities like their monthly water play in the school's play pool and playground time., I have very good 2 yrs+ experience at Orange Tree Preschool and it was a pity when I have to relocate and change school this year. My kids love the school, the teachers and their friends. They always look forward to going to school.  Ms Hema who is the principal cares a lot for the kids and she can remember all their names. She always smiles warmly to receive the kids and waves goodbye fondly when she sends them home. I think all the parents can really see the passion that she has for this job. And if I have any concerns, I feel comfortable to communicate it with her and she will help to address them. The admins in the school are also very nice and provide me with good support.  I remembered when my 3 YO first entered school into Nursery One. She cried for the first week. Ms Hema and ËµµËÄÅÂ∏à were there to hug and console her and then she settled down pretty fast. After one week she was no longer crying. It was really heartwarming that my girl could look towards the principal and her form teacher for comfort. And the fact that she settled down after their hugs mean she trust them as well. ËµµËÄÅÂ∏à was very patient with my girl and also helped my girl to overcome her food chewing problem. I really appreciate the patience and concern that ËµµËÄÅÂ∏à put in. ËµµËÄÅÂ∏à is really a dedicated and responsible teacher. There were a lot of effort that she put in on my girl during her preschool stay to help her learning. My girl always told me at home that she loves ËµµËÄÅÂ∏à. Even now when she is in a different preschool, she says she misses ËµµËÄÅÂ∏à, Teacher Rachel and her friends.  Then my boy also entered PGC and we found another gem teacher ÊõæËÄÅÂ∏à. She was good to my boy and really care a lot for him. She will give me constant updates about him.  Overall I think OrangeTree is a good preschool and their environment is good for the kids. They do 2:3 days of chinese and english respectively and alternate every week. Their enrichment classes and school outings are also affordable. And they have their own swimming pool which not a lot of school have. The kids get to play water activities once in a while.  Thanks to all the teachers and staff who had shown your care and concern for my two kids., School environment is good and clean. 2 kids attended the school and graduated. Principle and teachers always give their best care and attention to the kids. Feeling blessed and grateful that we chosen this school as their preschool üëç ‚Ä¶, Both my kids were in OTP and it has been a wonderful learning experience for the kids. They get a lot of care and attention, and are kept stimulated with fun, creative learning activities and regular outdoor time (there‚Äôs a pool in the outdoor area even). The teachers are all approachable and caring.  The curriculum is well structured with both English and Chinese languages, which expose my kids into variety of activities that develop all kinds of skills they need. The enrichment classes are at reasonable price, I can tell the improvement since my daughter started her Speech and Drama class about a year ago. She also enjoyed her Arts classes and brought back beautiful art pieces.  The communication with the school and teachers is also good. The APP regularly updates the activities of the kids (with photos) which let the parents have the sense of what the kids are playing at school. Announcement are also timely updated through the APP as well. Furthermore, when my kids were absent due to illness, the teachers always call me during their lunch break to check on the kids condition, and they also call to update me whenever there‚Äôs minor injuries in school (e.g minor scratches due to kids playing). The principal is supper attentive too, fast response in WhatsApp message, and super accommodating when I request to extend school for another week after the withdrawal process is done.  Overall I am very happy with Orange Tree Preschool and I felt lucky to pick this school 3 years ago after comparing a few centres in BP area. Now due to house moving, I have to transfer my kids to other childcares. It‚Äôs really a heart pain decision, I can‚Äôt find the similar type of school at the same fee range anymore.  Lastly, I would like to extend my heartfelt appreciation to Principal Ms Hema for leading a strong team of teachers, for welcoming and cheering the children daily with her sunshine personality, for taking initiatives and for her clear communications to parents.  Thanks for all the dedicated hard work!, Orange Tree PreSchool offers an environment conducive for learning. Their curriculum is very well thought out. It‚Äôs very enriching and holistic in developing the children. There seems to always be something new and exciting for the kids to look forward to.  Both my boys are enrolled with the school, and we are very pleased with the improvement on their social skill, problem solving skill and self discipline which they can apply to their daily life.  The Principal and teachers are sincere, passionate and professional, they provide a loving and caring environment for the children. We are at ease knowing our boys were well taken care of and having great fun in school.  Thank you Ms Hema for having us at Orange Tree, we are grateful for having these sweet memories on their growing up journey!, Will highly recommend Orange Tree to families staying around the vicinity. Academically wise it is definitely advanced and the environment is very pleasant too. My kid has a great time and from a shy little preschooler, has now blossomed into a confident and independent individual., The childcare center is very clean environment and professional staffs. I would like to thanks the entire staffs and specifically, the principal, Ms. Hema, for her kindness and expertises.  My kids are having very good time there and enjoy the school. The teachers are very prompt response.  I would definitely recommend this preschool to other parents., Quality preschool is important to give our children a good head start. The quality of a school is deemed by the quality of the teachers and I must say the teachers are good. I placed my children in this school as the teachers are caring and the kids are exposed to different learning experiences. The fees are around $1000 after subsidy - a little pricey, but investing in education is always worth it., We first knew of OT from a friend who schooled her daughter there. We have never regretted our choice since! Both my kids enrolled here. My elder has since graduated and the curriculum taught in OT helped him tremendously to ease into P1. He even commented that it was boring for the 1st sem as he already learnt what was taught in K2. My younger is currently in N2 and we see her learning well, and communicating well especially in mandarin. Teachers are always caring and attentive. My elder still enjoys picking the younger one together so that he can see his teachers and say hi. The principal has always been there for us too, even beyond school hours. Strongly recommend OT CCK to others residing in the area., Both our kids are from here and we recommended this preschool due to their cleanliness and syllabus. After graduation from here my kids did well in Primary 1 and have no problem following thru Primary 1.  Until today both my kids love their preschool. We spent at least 4 years in this preschool for each of our child., Poor environment, teachers mostly are lack of patience due to less man power. 1980s style of communication with hand writing on a so call com-book! Not allow to communicate with teachers directly. All matters need to go through principle, yet principle knows nothing at all.  No covered pick up area, children always get all wet if raining.  Poor arrangement of sending in children every morning, due to less of communication, every parent wants to talk to teachers which makes the flow of sending children in to stuck! especially during COVID period, 15-20 parents and children in a 2 sq meter area for sometimes 15-20mins, not safe at all.  Food is terrible, properly all students sharing 300g meat. Principle is  arrogant, always blaming on children own problems. Nothing need be improved from school side. Teachers always change due to limited manpower, no one actually can understand children‚Äôs real status. Likely we left this school after 6 months bad experience. Once we confirmed to leave, child sleeves were wet almost everyday. Ask him to go toilet by himself, pants were never been worn properly! Ask principle to let teachers ask kid to drink more water due to ulcer, principle response: ‚Äúyou can choose not to send him in‚Äù Not recommend at all. Principle‚Äôs Attitude decides teacher‚Äôs attitude, which may makes the whole environment horrible.  Kid started to learn sentences like ‚Äúyou know I am not a super woman, do it by yourself; do it properly oh, don‚Äôt make me scold you ah! ‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶..‚Äù  Parents, pls do not waste the time and money, s$300 school doing better than this one!, Both my kids have attended this school for 7 years between them. The Teachers are very patient and caring and the environment is v clean. Both my kids love the school!, The preschool provides holistic curriculum which has honed my 2 children with adequate life skills & set strong language (English and Chinese) foundations to prepare them for a smoother transition into primary one. (My eldest is now in P3 and youngest is now in K2. Both joined when they were in PG)  The class conducts structured lessons where my children are introduced to a thematic range of learning concepts from family to traffic to food etc. Mathematical and scientific knowledge are also included in their program through indoor experiments and outdoor exploration, where my 2 kids can pick up relevant skills from there.  Teacher-parent communication is also very proactive through messaging & communication book, despite the inconvenience posed during covid period. The safety concern of the school kids in the compound are one of their priorities too, so I am assured that my kids are in trusted hands from drop off to fetching.  My youngest is graduating this month, and she would surely miss the teachers, principals, the aunties who help out in their meals and the cleaners. Lastly, thank you for giving a positive experience to my girls' growing up journey. It has been awesome! üëç, The school is behind and above the Bukit Panjang Singpost office. It is a huge preschool with 200+ students. There is barely any partition between classes. I couldn‚Äôt imagine how noisy it can be during actual school hours. The school has nice facilities, such as an outdoor playground, sand areas, and even a small water pool. However, the facilities are next to the main CCK road trip where there‚Äôs always traffic as well as noises and dust. The menu is not very healthy that you could expect jam and kaya for breakfast for younger toddlers., Teachers are professional and friendly."
The Playground Preschool,
The Schoolhouse by Busy Bees (Alexandra),"Simply love the teachers and this school. Fun and engaging activities. Attentive and caring teachers., They provided the excellent education in this centre. The principal Ms. Ada is very helpful and well organised for all they need! Lovely and friendly teachers in this centre too!, Recommend this school. Thumbs up to the staff, the environment and the curriculum, Feel the home-like service atmosphere, feel the vitality of the team, and feel the school‚Äôs professional team"
The Schoolhouse by Busy Bees (Aroozoo),"Very nice facilities, passionate and dedicated teachers and good diversity of the food menus for a balanced diet. We can see the children are very happy there!, Awesome program. Love the school, the teachers, the P and the kids there, Highly recommended. Wide open space for kids to runabout - two playground and water play area. School is focused on learning through play and Ms Wee leads a team of talented and passionate teachers. The school compound is probably the best I've seen in the area, My daughter goes there and the teachers are very good., Keep up the good work, please!, Musfirahtullah Nabi Ibrahim"
The Schoolhouse by Busy Bees (Buckley),"During our relocation to Singapore, one of the most important things for us to get settled was choosing the most ideal school for our then 2.5-year-old daughter.  My husband and I did countless hours of research, and I personally visited 13 different schools, and sat down with 13 different principals to understand the learning tools/ structure, and core values of each school.  It wasn't until I met Natalie from Pat's Buckley that my husband and I both knew we had found the right school.  Natalie was professional, personable, caring, welcoming, and very engaging.   We were also very pleased with the tour provided by Miss Gen at the time. I'm especially pleased that both Natalie and Miss Gen are receptive to parental feedback. It's so easy to see that they are dedicated in the improvement of the school's learning environment.  My child‚Äôs transition to a new school in a new country was made easier under the guidance of her teachers miss Jae and Liu Laoshi.  She participated in a variety of activities and events and enjoyed both her teachers and classmates.  Liu Laoshi has a vibrant personality, always smiling and ready to assist.    Miss Jae is extremely caring, kind, and helpful.  She is also genuinely concerned about my child‚Äôs well-being in school and always takes her time to keep me updated whenever I see her during school pick up and drop off.   My child continued to grow over the years under the patient care and guidance of Miss Jae, Miss Kristie, Guo Laoshi, and Xu Laoshi. It's especially heartwarming to see my child constantly singing and dancing to the songs that she's learnt at school from her music lessons with Miss Eunice.  Fast forward a few years, my older child has graduated, and my younger child is now also attending Pat‚Äôs and loving school under the care of her teachers Miss Tina and Sun Laoshi. Every day my child is always happy to go to school and full of smiles when I pick her up.  As a parent, I feel extremely grateful to be part of an institution where the leadership team and the teachers focus on the well-rounded development of a child.  The current Principal Miss Gen‚Äôs warm and compassionate demeanor radiates throughout the entire school, creating an environment of kindness and respect. The teachers are equally amazing. They are passionate about teaching and care deeply about the well-being and development of every child. Their creativity and enthusiasm shine through in every activity and lesson. They have a genuine love for their students, and it shows in the way they interact with them.  My family loves seeing the high level of care from the teachers, and we are grateful for the new and close friendships we've also created with some of the parents.  I cannot thank the staff at Pat‚Äôs Schoolhouse Buckley enough for the incredible care, love, and education they have provided for my two kids.   Not only have they learned academic skills, but they have also developed social and emotional skills that will serve well in life.  I highly recommend Pat‚Äôs Buckley to any parent looking for a safe, nurturing, and high-quality preschool. The principal and teachers are truly exceptional, and we are so grateful for the positive impact they have had on our family., My elder son started going to Pats Buckley at 5. It was our best decision. Excellent teachers Ms Rae Zhou lao shi nurture and set a good foundation in academic and character, for him to carry on into primary school. Now, my younger daughter is also attending. My kids always look forward and enjoy going to school. Teachers and principal Ms Gen are caring., My baby is very happy at school. The teachers are professional and care for my baby, Spacious pre-school with a playground in the front garden! Great location. Nice teachers., Great school.  The teachers and head teacher do an amazing job.  So well organised and personalised.  Happily recommend, My girl loves Pat School House. She graduated last year and is missing her teachers so much., Caring teachers. Really engaging and always show love for my kid."
The Schoolhouse by Busy Bees (Claymore),
The Schoolhouse by Busy Bees (Dover),Hi I'm Iris and I went to this school since I was N1 I don't know whether some of the teachers still know me. I'm 11 now and hope to go back there and visit someday.....
The Schoolhouse by Busy Bees (Gentle Road),"The teachers are well trained professionals. They demonstrate patience, willingness to listen to parents‚Äô recommendations and are equipped with various strategies to guide the kids. The classroom environment is not jarringly colourful but pleasing and inviting. Activities are meticulously planned to facilitate children in achieving their learning objectives. The school pays attention to detail. For instance, to make the students feel welcomed, they play uplifting music at the entrance. Within 2 months of enrolment, my son has become more confident, articulate and even his eating habits have improved., Both my kids have been attending this centre, and I'm glad that this is like a second home to them. They love going to school to meet their friends, and always have positive things to say about school. Teachers work closely with parents and have created a safe and cosy environment for the kids to explore in. Teacher Liyana has been the teacher for both my kids and she is great at engaging them and truly cares for them!, My boy, current K1 student at Pat's Schoolhouse @ Gentle Road looks forward to go to school everyday. The teachers and staff are very dedicated, experienced and patient. The school curriculum is also well designed and engaging for e.g. field trips are included and the recent one was the kids went to the Traditional Arts Centre to learn about Chinese Opera and gets to try on costumes and props. My boy shared that he enjoyed it and even tried to do a bit of chinese opera at home. I would highly recommend Pat's schoolhouse @ gentle road to all parents. The kids will be happy and in very safe hands to learn and enjoy., Our daughter joined Pat's Schoolhouse (Gentle Road) in Jan 2023. We were worried that she would take a while to get used to the new school, but in just 3 months, she has settled in very quickly to the new environment.  I like that there are 2 dedicated teachers to her playgroup (1 English & 1 Mandarin), which allows her to be exposed to both languages frequently. Both Ms Cindy & Huang Laoshi) have been very patient and encouraging, which is what we feel is very important for our 3 yr old daughter.  We also know how difficult it is engaging the curious toddler, so rather than just staying indoors, the school also places importance on outdoor exploration (E.g Nature walks, Art play, Water play), which is key for a child's development at this stage.  Ms Pavai who manages this branch has also been very involved with our daughter's development, doing constant check-ins to ensure she is coping and progressing well.  Pats Schoolhouse (Gentle Road) has really been an all rounded holistic playschool for our daughter, and we couldn't be happier that she is having so much fun here!, Warm and friendly team of dedicated teachers and staff that bond well with the children. Teachers tend to stay on with low turnover in my child‚Äôs class last year and this year. Both my kids look forward to going to school and are very fond of their teachers. Ms Pavai the principal is a good leader and relates takes time to interact with the children and parents, Been sending my son to this centre since before Pat's tookover. My son felt comfortable with the teachers, and I instantly feel safe sending him there (at 1.5years old). The centre management gets parents involved, run programs beyond just classroom, and also been very good at communicating and mamaging expectations of parents when it comes to childs safety. V happy to have my son here and to continue., Terrible new principle Ms Pavi who imposes obsessively strict health check up protocols, making working parents‚Äô life miserable. You need to be prepared for a call anytime to pick up your child who might have some mild issues such as running nose whereas in the past you would only get calls when the child has fever or is genuinely ill. When asked about the exact protocols, she said it is the same across all schools and will send me a copy soon. I haven‚Äôt received it until now. It is just her style to flip flop based on the parents‚Äô toughness without any principles. Very disappointing new management. I missed the old loving and caring environment when Ms Julianna and Ms Jiahui were still here. They were reasonable, caring and considerate.  Further to the above, Ms Pavi tends to push the junior teachers to the front line to deal with angry parents even if the issue has been escalated to her level. She also fails to deliver whatever she promised in the call with me. With all the fake promises and bad experience dealing with her, I don‚Äôt think she is a trustworthy person, not to mention a principle of a preschool that I have to trust my children with.  The teachers are nice and dedicated though and deserve a five star. I hope they are not pushed too hard by her., My toddler started his preschool journey here and he has adjusted well to enjoy school. Thankful to all teachers, staff and ms Pavai for making him feel safe and comfortable so he can have fun and learn, My daughter started attending toddler class in January this year. She‚Äôs extremely afraid of strangers but the teachers‚Äô patience and dedication has helped her adapt to school slowly but surely. They took onboard my suggestions and did their best to help her in school. I must commend her teachers, Miss Hui Zhen and Wang laoshi as well as Miss Wendy for really taking care of the little ones., I have placed my two children here for their preschool years. The curriculum is engaging and the teaching staff are very dedicated. Teacher Florence and Teacher Siti are my children‚Äôs favourites. Principal Pravai manages the school well., My daughter started at Pat‚Äôs last year. Her teachers have been great; not only have they made her a more confident young lady, but they also keep us updated on her development and daily happenings., My son truly enjoys his everyday at PATS. The teachers are very experienced, patient and friendly. The curriculum is well designed. Highly recommended!, I was a bit hesitant to join a ‚Äúnewer‚Äù Pats Sch because I didn‚Äôt have much feedback to fall back on. But happy to report that I now have two kiddos who are part of the school and they are loving it., appreciate the teachers and staff for taking the time to understand my child's needs and helping him on his developmental journey, Dedicated teachers. my children enjoy school very much, Amazing educators who love children., Teachers are dedicated and caring!, Very good teachers!"
The Schoolhouse by Busy Bees (Grassroots√Ç¬í Club),"My two kids have been in the school since infant care days. The teachers are nurturing and engaging, and take a keen interest in the kids‚Äô development and happiness. We love the activities and curriculum that has been adopted (balancing learning with play) and are very satisfied with how the school is well managed. Highly recommended!, It is true to what it described itself to be, more than a preschool, to both my children who grew up with Pat's since they were both 6 months of age. It has been 3 years since my elder child graduated from Pat's but she would still tell me those years she spent with Pat's were the most fun years of her life. She holds fond memories of the teachers that patiently taught, nurture and guided her. My younger child will be graduating from Pat's end of this year which saddens me to think that we will be parting with the team of teachers who are like family to my children. Looking back, entrusting my children with Pat's was the best decision made as a parent!, Both my kids enrolled with Pat‚Äôs GRC, starting with infant care. Am grateful for the dedicated, warm and nurturing teachers who helped my little ones settle in and provide the guidance they need in their formative years. Appreciate that Principal Ms Elsie and Vice principal Ms Joelynn are professional, committed and experienced. Centre administrator Ms Serene is helpful and prompt with advice on administrative matters. All of which make communication a breeze. Overall, the centre provides a conducive learning environment and varied curriculum to engage the children for a holistic development. Seeing my firstborn with fond memories of his preschool days  and my younger one looking forward to attending school everyday, sharing fun and happy anecdotes of daily events, are testaments to the wonderful team!, It‚Äôs been 9 months since my son started and he absolutely loves going to Pats and he loves his teachers. The teachers are friendly and helpful, we get constant updates on his progress. They are always prompt at providing feedback or helping with enquiries. The school involves the parents in many aspects. This year alone we have visited the school twice! I love that we get to see what the kids are up to, and their learning environment., A good experience of childcare generally involves creating a safe, nurturing and stimulating environment for children. This includes providing basic needs such as food, shelter, and hygiene as well as engaging in activities that promote their physical, cognitive, social, and emotional development.  Ultimately, a good experience of childcare is one where the child feels loved, supported and valued, and where they provided with opportunities to learn, grow and thrive. This also include regular updates on the child's progress, sharing of concerns or challenges and working together to establish consistent routines and boundaries.  This is what Pat's Schoolhouse Preschool at Grassroots' Club is all about and is able to provide for our child., My girl has been attending school at PSH Grassroots Club since last year and we are grateful to see that the staff are caring towards the child's well-being and responsive to our feedback and queries. We also receive timely update about school activities and can see that she enjoys school a lot. She often mentions her teachers and friends in class too. Appreciate Ms Elsie and her team for their love for the kids., My son has been going to Pat‚Äôs since Jan under toddler class (18m+). Really appreciated the orientation period to sit in during the first few days to allow him to adjust to the school and observe the lessons. Teachers are very professional and curriculum is great. Baby adapted to the new env quickly and he seems to enjoy a lot (esp playground time such as sandplay) Very structured classes and he has already picked up great habits (putting plates back and taking off the shoes by himself). Big thanks to the teachers at Pat‚Äôs!, Amazing safe haven for my little ones; started the journey 5 years ago with my eldest and didn‚Äôt even hesitate second time round. no better infant/childcare. for me it‚Äôs less about the facilities but more the people, the teachers, educators, staff, and principle - who are all excellent and loving and nurturing. every place is going to have sick kids and bouts of outbreaks here and there but it‚Äôs the quality of the people working there that sets this place apart. You can tell they work from their hearts and really love the kids. 5 years later still can‚Äôt imagine a better place to entrust my precious kids!, My little one is with Pat's school house @ grassroots since she was 10 months old. She is almost 2 years old now :) She talks about her teachers and friends at home, so I think that's a clear showing she loves school. We get regular updates on her developments/activities in school and I appreciate that the communication is very open between the teachers/staff and us. My little one loves the outdoor time (playground and sand play) and I think that is one of the plus point of enrolling in this pre-school!, Through a friends‚Äô recommendation, we registered our eldest girl at Patschoolhouse Grassroots club.  Looking back, it was definitely the best decision we‚Äôve ever made! This particular branch is filled with professional teachers right from The principal (Miss Elsie), Vice Principal (Miss Joelynn), Centre Adminstrator (Miss Serene) and to all levels of teachers.  Prior to our decision to enrol at Pat's, we had visited quite a number of preschools and Pats schoolhouse Grassrootsclub was shortlised as we are assured of the quality of the curriculum as well as the centre's management.  We personally found the letterland programme very beneficial for our kid's learning in their formative years and coupled with learning through play structures. All these provide a conducive environment for their learning development.  In addition, it is the only school that has its own kitchen and able to cater to my girl‚Äôs special dietary requirements. We are thankful to the kitchen aunts and uncles who have been so kind and accommodating.  Most importantly, thank you for the safe, fun and bi-lingual environment which both my girls are looking forward to daily! The various excursion trips arranged for the kids were very enriching and is definately great exposure for both my princesses!, My daughter, husband and I have very much enjoyed the skilful nurturing and loving care from the teachers and team at Pats (GRC). In this supportive environment, we find that our daughter has grown to be a confident and eloquent girl, who has a good sense of play and independence, and who likes to learn. She also continues to find school ‚Äúvery fun‚Äù and often looks forward to going., I feel that Pat's schoolhouse is home to dedicated educarers who provide guidance and support to both the parents and children. It gives me a great deal of comfort to know that my children enjoy their preschool years and most importantly that they are well-taken care of by very committed educators., We been sending Emmy since she was 4 months old till she is 6 this year.  Pat‚Äôs at grassroots had made it so memorable by creating a nurturing environment for young mind to grow. We have all the edu-carers who had been a big part of our lives to thank.  They are so passionate and caring and a BIG thank you to Miss Rhoda, Sanae at infant care who treat my kid like theirs.  The toddler and kindergarten teacher - ‰∏ÅËÄÅÂ∏àÔºå Miss Trysta, Miss Caroline, Mis Jocelyn, Miss Sya, Âº†ËÄÅÂ∏à and many more who is always trying their best to play and teach.  Not forgetting Ms Serene- the administrator who is there since Day 1 when we joined and always so genuine to all the kids and their families.  Good job and keep it up! :), Saw that the negative reviews are pertaining to grassroot‚Äôs club facility but this is the pre-school. My son has been at Pat‚Äôs since infant care. Very good teachers and support staff here! Highly recommended!, Our kids totally enjoyed their formative years at PSH grassroots.    Given a choice again,  we wouldn‚Äôt have chose anywhere else! Thanks to Elsie and your wonderful team !, One of the best kindergartens in the area. Please mind most of the reviews are off-topic as they are confusing Pats School kindergarten with the Chinese Restaurant or the Club itself., The teachers were great.both my kids enjoyed their pre school days, Located in a peaceful precinct in Yio Chu Kang, it's near Yio Chu Kang MRT and the Yio Chu Kang Sport Complex. Very well connected to the town., Love the care and concern the teachers and staff have for the kids., Wonderful pre-school with dedicated and sincere teachers and staff!, The food is reasonably good, service is good. The place is good for functions and gathering...my 2nd time here..quite happy!, It's just a building with a big hall,  an acceptable quality Chinese restaurant and a few childcare Centres, Place looks modern and contains up to date facilities. Good place to host events., Went there for an Enagic, Kangen water seminar, good place and plenty of room, Team of passionate Educators and structured curriculum!, Couples can hold wedding dinner here and corporate cAn hold events., Good location, near the MRT station, clean and well maintenance place., Had a typical Chinese cuisine, Hong Kong styles., Really quite a dead place to go units you have some preplanned activities taking place, Next to NYP and Yio Chu Kang MRT Station., Quiet and nice area to chill and enjoy the food and surrounds, wen there to celebrate my cousin brother bday with his class, Very near yio chu kang station, The Chinese restaurant serves good food, Limited parking during peak hour, A Club for the Recognition of Grassroots Leaders !, Great yoga classes., lmao, Relaxing, Newly renovated., Good community place., nice place"
The Schoolhouse by Busy Bees (Katong),"The Schoolhouse at Katong shines with its dedicated leadership and caring educators, providing a nurturing environment for children to thrive in. (a parent of 3), Currently, my daughter is 3 years old and has been with Pats Schoolhouse Katong for 14 months. Aside from being impressed with the school's curriculum, I was also delighted to see how much my daughter enjoys going to school. I am grateful to the teachers for making learning fun and enjoyable with their passion and patience. Ultimately, teachers are what make a school great.  An excellent and professional childcare center with a friendly and caring educator. I like how well organised everything is and how homey the atmosphere is. Definitely recommended, I just moved my child out of Pats Katong branch to another new childcare in 2022. Massive disappointment of our experiences at Katong branch. My child had been with pats schoolhouse from start, past experiences with Pats Shaer (now defunct) and Pats Sembawang was fantastic with great teachers, principals, and environment where they really care for your kids.  In Pats Katong branch, experiences was drastically different.  -Messy hair of child when return from school -No dry of child‚Äôs hair after water play till end of the day. -Child say food given not enough, still hungry. (Apparently quantity is limited as food delivered from Katong 1 to Katong 2) -Rashes due to not cleaning up well after toilet use and teacher just looking at her outside the toilet, even when child asked for help. -Child progress updates on app by K1 teacher was just for the sake of doing, posting general pictures, no additional comments of child progress. -Whole classroom looking at video from a small monitor??? (see pic) Even smaller than my home monitor screen.  Some of the above points, I still can brush it away, as might be 5 year old saying wrong things, lack of preschool teachers, lockdown, branch too big etc ‚Ä¶  But the final straw is really the poor communication of confirmed covid cases in same class. Thou they mentioned it was as per MOH protocol of 2 days after report then school will announce (I dun understand rational of this). As school did not communicate promptly, eventually is parents communicating between each other then we are aware of the situation.  Worse still, entire class gotten HRN from MOH, even thou most kids DID NOT attend school most of that week.  By just simply looking at check-in records, school will know exactly whom attended school but I guess admin dun even bother to check and just submit entire list to MOH.  Anyway, child is happy in new childcare and instantly we can see the drastic differences in the new childcare, communication, enrolment procedures, hygiene taken when entering school etc.. Things i do not see in Pats Katong.  I still believe in Pats schoolhouse programs (other branches), just that the experience at Katong branch really leave much to be desired. Probably this branch is too big to be managed, lets this branch will improve and be better managed for the future!, I took my kids out from a very dirty Pre-school where they hired teachers with no qualification. I am very glad we found Pat's schoolhouse. the campus is very clean and the communication between teachers, school management and the parents is very transparent. I can follow up with the development of my children easily. My kids are very happy here and the teachers here are so lovely, sweet and professional. They care about the happiness of the kids and also the developmental milestones of kids by ages and stages., This school is awesome! This is a daycare + school. Your child can learn Gymnastics and be a bilingual student by learning Chinese, Great school. Good balance between playing and learning. They are moving to a different location in March 2016., Terrible pre school. Teachers with no passion and love for kids., School Building before restoration"
The Schoolhouse by Busy Bees (Lakeside),"My 3rd child is now in Pat's Schoolhouse (Lakeside), while his 2 older siblings have graduated 4~6yrs ago. As parents, we feel assured leaving our children in the safe hands of the teachers. Communication with parents have always been prompt and frequent., My kid has been with Pats since 2018 til graduation today. All throughout this period including the pandemic, I have been beyond impressed with the quality of care and education, provided by passionate principal and teachers who make me feel like this is not just a job to them‚Ä¶ for eg, all the teachers know all the kids by name regardless of level! So special thanks to Kristy and her team for creating such wonderful memories for my kid, and giving me an easy time. Highly recommended. 10 stars!, The teachers and principal gave me a sense of calm that my child/children had been/is well taken care of. I don't need to worry about the curriculum as well., Teachers are very passionate Caring Experienced Communicate with parents regularly Safe environment Encourages child to be independent Must be Fun for children as my child loves to go to school, Good teachers and conducive environment"
The Schoolhouse by Busy Bees (Mt Emily),"I absolutely love this school. The facilities are a dream (garden to learn about the nature, pool for water play, parc nearby, ...); the staff is lovely and caring; the curriculum is engaging, diverse and fun. They organise a lot of activities for the kids and involve the parents. I can only recommend it., Your child will have a fantastic time at Pat's Mount Emily. Our experience with both kids has been incredible. The management and teachers are always welcoming the kids with a heartedly smile and make their best efforts not only to educate and care for the kids but also offer kindness above and beyond their scope of work. The school has many unique facilities that add up to the excitement at school; the veggie garden, sandpit, pool, in-house kitchen, live animal tank etc. You can expect a perfect mix of outdoor and indoor activities for your child that is filled with joy and learning opportunities."
The Schoolhouse by Busy Bees (Prinsep),"The teachers are very nice and friendly. And my child is very happy and enjoy herschool day. The teachers are always helpful and updating the daily details in pacient., Would be cautious of sending my child to a place that never picks up their hotline number on Google and on their website. The rare time that the call was recieved - the lady was snappy, rude and unwelcoming. When you are paying short of 2k a month the least you can expect is someone to pick up calls and be polite., Nisha is a great principal who runs a tight ship. At the same time,  she is always understanding and ready to connect and listen."
The Schoolhouse by Busy Bees (Ridgewood),"We love Pats! The teachers we have simply love kids and are so patient especially with the little ones! My 2 years old‚Äôs learning was obvious - good manners and habits, most importantly at this age he enjoys go to school!"
The Schoolhouse by Busy Bees (River Valley),"Before sending my elder son for pre-school, I‚Äôve visited more than 10 different schools around my area and nothing beats Pat‚Äôs Schoolhouse River Valley. Mainly because of the teachers and staff. I feel that they play such an integral role in the kids‚Äô learning journey, the shaping of their behaviour and social interaction.

The Schoolhouse by Busy Bees (Sembawang Country Club),"Our elder two have grown and matured under the wonderful and nurturing care of the school‚Äôs principal, teachers and staff who have a genuine passion and love for the kids, who are like a huge extended family to them and our family. The classrooms are well equipped with plenty of learning aids and the constant bilingual exposure has improved their language skills, especially in Chinese. The curriculum is well thought through and focuses on literacy, numeracy and STEM while they use various mediums to encourage learning through outdoor play, music, learning journeys amongst many others . Our children have cultivated a curious mindset with the habit of asking questions and a true love for learning. It‚Äôs been a wonderful journey with Pat‚Äôs Sembawang so far ., Great school! Dedicated and caring staff. Spacious, clean and safe environment.

Thank you Pat‚Äôs Schoolhouse Sembawang for making learning FUN!, Pat‚Äôs Sembawang has been our home away from home since it first opened in 2013. Starting with our eldest who was part of the first batch of children to attend, we now have only our 4th and littlest left to torment the teachers. It has been a decade of driving to and fro, but it never felt like a chore because the kids have always been happy to go to school and are full of stories on the way home. The school is spacious and nestled amidst greenery, with facilities like a pool, indoor and outdoor playgrounds and lots of open spaces to explore. But more importantly, the teachers and staff are just super. So much love, so much dedication, so much patience, so much sincerity. And the kids love the food! Given all of this, we never thought of changing schools, even when we moved further away. When our littlest graduates this year, we graduate along with her. We will miss the school and all its people as much as all the kids do. Thank you to the P, VP, teachers, staff and aunties, you are all wonderful people who have created such lovely memories for the children (and us) to cherish., It‚Äôs a wonderful school that I send both my children to. They enjoy learning, exploring making new friends and always share their experiences from PAT‚Äôs. The teachers are highly skilled and constantly update us about their progress. The school also encourages the parents to actively participate in their take home work and get involved in their syllabus., After choosing PATS Sembawang for my elder son, it was only natural for us to continue with the school for my second son when he needed to start playgroup, as we were very pleased with the school‚Äôs high teaching standards. The school administrators and teaching staff have been very supportive and proactive in ensuring that both my sons were well catered for and that they were learning to the best of their abilities. I thank them for their wisdom and heart and look forward to the next few years with PATS Sembawang., My daughter has been attending Pat's Schoolhouse in Sembawang since she was 18 months and has been loving it! It's not only her loving and caring teachers that are engaged, the whole staff is involved in the children's education. It is an excellent preschool for kids who are free to express their creativity and thrive in their early years!, Having been with Pat‚Äôs Schoolhouse Sembawang for the last 9 years, we‚Äôve seen how our children thoroughly enjoy their time with their friends and caring teachers. The school is like their second family and we‚Äôre thankful that we can remain in close contact even after the kids graduate from pre-school. Our youngest 2 will cherish their remaining few years with the school and we look forward to forming more memories and experiences together!, Both of my kids attend Pat's Sembawang. We really love the school for the kind and caring teachers and staff, the values in nurturing independent learners and explorers, the conducive teaching environments.

She looks forward to Monday's every week as its time to see her lovely teachers and friends.  This is truly an experience every child should have !, Both our kids go to this school. The teachers are professional and friendly. The curriculum is well structured. Last but not the least, the views from the school are stunning!, Great sch and in love with the education tactics for the kids. Both my kids enjoyed their journey at pats sch house sembawang, - Most importantly the Safety, Security, Hygiene of our Children - Secondly, the teachers and support staff are so kind and attached to every kid - Lastly, the curriculum and activities which help the kids to get ready for the upcoming challenges & parents are being updated very frequently on the progress and happenings at school via the App., Caring teachers, interesting and enriching bilingual curriculum plus learning through play for  kids., An absolutely dedicated team of both teaching and non-teaching staff., Nice school environment, Amazing teachers, nice preschool, As a long-established private kindergarten in Singapore, PATS‚Äôs brand quality does not need to be elaborated. I chose pats sembawang country club campus mainly because of its following advantages: 1. Have your own outdoor activity area and the teachers do take the children outdoors on non-rainy days: at least 2 hours of outdoor activities a day are the best protection for children‚Äôs eyes, so I put outdoor conditions first when choosing a kindergarten. First consideration. As well as the school's own play facilities, the school also shares some facilities with the golf club, such as the swimming pool, and the children have two water days each month. 2. Rich extra-school activities: There are actually plenty of activities for children to learn and play in school, but the school also carefully arranges some out-of-school activities, such as taking the children to the stadium to experience football, playing with excavators, and experiencing Experiencing Chinese opera and so on allows children to learn, feel and experience in happiness. 3. Teacher-student ratio: Compared with the ratio of 1:10 or 1:14 in many government kindergartens, the teacher-student ratio of pats sembawang is smaller. In many classes, two teachers teach 10-12 children. In Doudou class, there may be two teachers. A teacher only takes care of six or seven children, which is undoubtedly a great advantage for taking care of children's emotions and helping them adapt to school life. 4. Teacher quality: From what I have observed in the six months since my daughter entered kindergarten, all the teachers and staff at pats sembawang are friendly, polite, and enthusiastic. Before I chose this school, I took my children to the school gate to see the school. I saw that the teacher carried the children out after school, and they were still very dependent on the teacher when they were separated. When I saw that, I felt that it was a blessing to meet such a teacher. I was very lucky. Later, after my daughter entered the kindergarten, I discovered that we were also lucky, because the teachers here really like the children and are really good to them, so the children will naturally like and rely on them. 5. Convenient pick-up and drop-off: Unlike schools in shopping malls, picking up children here does not require you to worry about lack of parking spaces or being stuck in the grace period when leaving the parking lot (if you do not have a private car, you can also choose the school‚Äôs school bus service). 6. Daily communication: Through the school APP, you can see the daily updates of the children at school. Although it is not as large as some teachers who set up groups to share continuously, I prefer this method and I prefer teachers to spend more time. Spend time with your kids instead of focusing on taking photos and videos and sending instant group messages. 7. Food: I have visited many schools. I feel that since I want to send my children to kindergarten, I really have to relax. Because of religious reasons, the school does not provide red meat (pork and beef), so I can only rely on the food at home. Dinner supplement. In addition, we have to give up controlling sugar and snacks. When the children get together, it is really freeing and they are really happy. üò¨"

I have noticed the attention to details by the teachers, and my kid looks forward to going to school. I feel at ease when my kid is school.

Very interesting to see that Pat's Schoolhouse has 3 outlets in the area, and 1 closed down so with Azooroo, the prices are still the top in the area., This school was a blessing for our family. We shifted our child to this school after an incident at the last PCF.  The school principal and administrators were fantastic and always gave us a peace of mind.

The Sunbird Child Development Centre Pte Ltd,"Sunbird Childcare offers a nurturing atmosphere with dedicated teachers who are warm and actively engage in observing children within the school environment. Utilizing a communication app, the school ensures seamless updates and photo-sharing, allowing parents to stay informed about their children's activities at school. Ms. Rai, the principal, is highly responsive and supportive. Thus far, my children have been thoroughly enjoying their time at school.They also offer an excellent English literacy program for preschool kids. Additionally, they ensure that children have dedicated daily time for either self-guided or guided reading, which particularly appealed to me during the school tour.  These past few weeks have been wonderful for the kids, and we eagerly anticipate their entire preschool journey at Sunbird., Sunbird childcare has a caring environment and have attentive teachers. The teachers are warm and tries to provide observations of my child in the school setting. The school also uses an app for communications, updates and to share photos of what the kids have been up to in school. Another plus point of the school is the literacy programme. The kids alternate weekly between an English and mother tongue book. This consistent reading habit has helped to deepen my child‚Äôs love for reading.  Thanks to the teachers and school leaders, my boy has been happily attending school since 2022., My daughter was previously in a mega centre and I transferred her to sunbird because I have high expectations from their literacy program. My daughter who is in K, has been attending Sunbird for almost 2 weeks now and she has been nothing short of happy. She seems to be excited about school and she has made a 'best friend' already. The teachers are warm and understanding. I've had nothing but good interaction with my daughter's Laoshi. I love how intuitive their app is, the teachers will reply and even send you updates and photos. With that said, even the principal has been very forthcoming by sending out daily pictures and updates regarding how my daughter has been coping etc. Another plus point for this centre is that even though it is not a mega centre, they actually do have around 3 enrichment programs for the children and it is really reasonably priced. Overall, I am happy and I do hope my child will continue to benefit from the learning and teaching at the school., The teachers in the centre are very caring and attentive. My boy had joined them in May and he adapted well with the teachers' help. We can see the smiles on him everyday. Their literacy program is very good to encourage the kids to read. The variety of books are carefully procured to suit the kids of different age groups in the centre. Thank you for the effort and time to help him get comfortable in such a short period of time., Enrolled my son in the early November as the nearest Centre to my new house. The principal of the Centre always keep up to date with the parent like myself. As my son is most clingy to me, the teachers have the good attitude, patience and quite handy when my son is not used to the childcare yet. Hopefully with time given for now and future, my son will slowly develop his love for school so as to get along with the teachers and enjoy the playing session with other toddlers., Choosing the right child care center is a significant decision for any parent, and after an extensive search, we found Sunbird Learning & Development Center to be a beacon of excellence in providing a safe, stimulating, and nurturing environment for my child.

They instil good qualities in the children and have a good attitude. The curriculum is hands-on with strong literacy skills as a foundation."
The Word Learning Centre,"My son joined this school at the age of 6 in K2 in 2020. Previously, he was enrolled in 2 other schools. I happened to go to this school without knowing much as there were not much written or spoken about the school online. Also, given the high school fee, I was skeptical initially about how the school would add value to the learning for my child. But I must admit, I was wrong.  Saying anything may not be enough about our amazing experience in developing my child. It offered everything a young child needs to forward in life and I think it‚Äôs all because of the staff! The leadership, love & dedication of the staff is OUTSTANDING! Teaching and guiding with love is how I describe it. The teachers at word learning centre are the very best and were paying attention to individual child and correcting them wherever needed! EVERY Teacher there is committed to student learning, growth & success.  In order to encourage children, they used to reward children with token memento/ certificate etc. They inculcated diary writing, book reading, mental math so strongly that even now it has become a part of routine for my son. Besides studies, encouraging child to take participation in extracurricular activities like science models, art, craft, dance, public speaking etc. too was a part of developing children.  Overall, in my opinion word learning centre is truly an amazing place and I am thankful for my children's time there! If I could rewind and do it all again, I would still choose this school to build the foundation of my son‚Äôs academic growth from the very beginning., Both our kids attended TWLC and it was absolutely one of the most memorable school experiences, both for the kids & us parents! We spoke with other parents who have kids at TWLC and they had positive things to say. Aside from being close to home, we chose the school because of the teachers. They allow kids to learn at their own pace, explore and have fun. Highly recommended!, Our daughter has been with the school since N1, and currently in K2.  The learning progress made in TWLC pre-school, which is getting rarer, is streets ahead of childcare centres, the curriculum being more comprehensive.  It's a sure choice for children who have care giving arrangement., A wonderful school for youths. Very nurturing environment with wonderful teachers packed with lots of experience. My children attended TWLC between 2006 to 2013. Both of them enjoyed themselves very much at TWLC and were equipped with skills that will last them their lifetimes.  A school we trust.  Mr & Mrs Wong, The best decision we made when we enrolled our boy, Javen, at TWLC for his preschool education. Teachers were caring, nurturing and truly passionate in what they were doing. Every child was given opportunities to excel and realise his/her own potential. Curriculum was well-rounded, exposing the children to various domains like Science, Art, Music & Dance and Languages. The quarterly learning journeys were not only fun but enriching as well.  Teachers were receptive to feedback and had an open communication with parents. We always felt at ease and welcomed to speak with the teachers whenever we had any concerns about Javen.  When we moved house and were considering switching Javen out of TWLC so that we did not have to travel back to Woodlands, we faced difficulties in finding another school nearby which could match what TWLC could offer and with reasonable school fees. So we stayed on, despite having to travel further. That is how high the standard at TWLC is - it gives us the assurance that our children are in safe hands.  Thanks to TWLC for laying a strong foundation, Javen had no problems transitioning to Primary School. He has consistently been performing well from P1 to P5.  It has been five years since he graduated from TWLC, but the teachers and school remain close to our heart. We continue to visit the teachers occasionally and still feel right at home whenever we are at TWLC. It has been and will always be like a second home to us., Teachers are experience, patient and teach with love and passion. Clean and happy environment that my son loves and enjoys going to school everyday! An academic preschool that is able to prepare my son very well for P1. Best preschool in Woodlands!, Teachers in TWLC recognised the uniqueness of each and every individual kid and bring him to his full potential. Their professionals towards education and love for the kids cannot be doubt. Best school for the kids in Singapore in my humble opinion., Both my kids love going to TWLC. Great teachers and nice environment. It was a breeze transiting to P1 for my oldest, thanks to the strong foundation built from attending preschool in TWLC. üòä ‚Ä¶, When I first walked in there, I was 2 years old. An inexperienced and unknowledgeable kid. The memories I had there when I was about that age is sort of distorted, with flashes here and there. I remember crying a lot, definitely.  I mean, being in an unfamiliar place where my parents had just ‚Äòdumped‚Äô me in, I‚Äôm not particularly sure anyone of my age could have smiled through the whole process.  But throughout the course of a few months, I looked forward to going to school, the kindness of the teachers there had made me realize that there was no one that was going to swallow me whole there (I was actually afraid of the teachers).  With some friends that I grew really close to, I believe that I had been properly nurtured to be who I am today.  I am not only taught major subjects, but I‚Äôm also taught about values. Not just through lessons, but through friendships, experiences that I will never want to replace.  I walked, or was carried in as an unknowledgeable, inexperienced and antisocial shy person. But as I grew, like a butterfly, The World Learning Centre helped me to emerge as a butterfly out of the cocoon, showing of the vibrant colour of my talents. Spreading out my ‚Äòwings‚Äô and  flying into the baby blue colored canvas of a sky., Both of my kids have had great learning experiences at TWLC.

We are so glad that we found a centre with a great team of educarers and aunties who genuinely care for the toddlers with so much passion and love. Our son is quite shy when comes to new environment , and it takes some patience and care to him. We are so thankful that the educarers take the time and effort to understand our son‚Äôs needs. So this year we sent our daughter in to their PG in 2023. Our son and daughter is growing and learning so well under their care and we are grateful that he is being taken care of in a safe environment at TOUCH CC. Special thanks to the aunties who cook great food and Teachers, Ms yap, jiang lao shi, zhong lao shi, Ms serene, Ms sharon, Ms Keren, Ms jess, san san lao shi Thank you from the bottom of our hearts!, Teachers are rude and don't let my son out. Said we need to wait for the social worker to be there and allow my son to be out. Making my son cry inside when he is ready to be out. What's the Protocol? When we can always pick him up without any social worker. Why is this time needed? There's no answer from the teacher and they keep asking us to wait. Raised my voice to the teacher when I questioned them. We waited for 15mins. Every mins for access day is very precious to us., Love the caring teachers in Touch. My daughter joined the school in N1. She started learning how to be independent and went off diaper in less than 3months. The teachers are patient and genuinely love the kids. There are so many field trips and my kids had a lot of fun. There were so much thoughts put into the activities and events planned for the kids. From teaching the kids to give back to society, to meaningful field trips which are in line with the school term. In terms of academic, my daughter is well prepared for p1 with what she learned in school. My boy is currently in N2 and I‚Äôm sure he will enjoy his next two years in school as much as my daughter. Thank you TCC!, All my 3 children were attending TOUCH Childcare (Hougang) in these past 10years.  We are thankful to the teachers for being firm and patient when they discipline our children, yet gently and lovingly care for them everyday.  Our children were given opportunities to take care of other children who needed help, but they were showered with even more love and blessings by their classmates and their parents.  It has indeed been such an enriching experience for all our children!, Love this childcare center because teachers are friendly, polite and seem energetic. The teacher tied my granddaughter's hair as soon as she was free, and always a different style, really awesomeüëç. I also like that the surroundings are bright and clean, my little grandson will soon join them in three monthsüëç ‚Ä¶, My boy started with TCC in Dec‚Äô20 to do ICCP in 2021.  From little to no verbal speech and a very short attention span, in a short period of time he showed vast improvements in receptive language, and he was able to do the given worksheets.  The teachers also gave him the appropriate support and encouragement when guiding him with his fine motor ie. penmanship and coloring. They conduct their lesson in a small group setting in K1 which benefits children with special needs (SN) or those who need more assistance in learning progressively.  The school is very inclusive for children with SN and the other children in the school are also taught how to help their friends with challenges.  No child is excluded from any school activities, performances, field trips or ‚Äúcamping‚Äù in school.  For example, the teachers choreographed the graduation dance and taught my boy to dance in a way that he could manage, even getting classmates to support him in moving around during the dance. It is an incredible honor for my child to have the opportunity to experience being in a performance.  I salute the teachers' spirit of never giving up on any child. Teachers are always open to listening and discussing with us how they can better support our boy. They even go the extra mile to get stickers and books of his interest to motivate and reward him. Aunties were so sweet as well - they would do takeaway fruits or afternoon tea breaks for items that he likes if we need to bring him home earlier. It was such a memorable experience for our boy to do a sleepover in school with his classmate before they graduate.  He was even appointed to present the token of appreciation to the GOH during graduation.  It is an incredible opportunity for him to be trusted with this responsibility.  Under the leadership of Ms Candice, the children care community is like a big family. It is also so heartwarming that all the teachers are involved during the first in-person graduation since 2019.  We thank the teachers, aunties, administrative staff and the principal for the love, patience and understanding which they have shown as they nurtured him in such a holistic way., I am so grateful for the wonderful opportunity to have both my children attend TCC. They have the same amazing & dedicated ‚ù§Ô∏è teachers which brings added comfort as they truly know our family. My children are safe, happy , healthy & love telling me about all the fun they have each day. The Aunties which help in the kitchen also cook very delicious üòã foods for e children.  My kids ‚ù§Ô∏è it. üëçKnowing my children were in such caring hands underscores decision to have them attend TCC. Thank you TCCü•∞, Glad to see this school has improved. There use to be a lousy P in the year 2006. Hope she has left the industry for good. Teachers and Principals shud be passionate in this line."

From dedicated and caring teachers to a plethora of enriching programs, this establishment has created a nurturing environment for young minds to thrive.  The heart of Twinklekidz lies in its passionate and devoted teaching staff. The teachers (Teacher Debbie, Mel, Bee, Humairah, Liu Lao Shi & Lili Lao Shi just to name a few) go above and beyond, ensuring a caring and educational experience for each child. The art, music, and drama programs not only foster creativity but also instill confidence in the children, preparing them for a bright future.  Moreover, the commitment and responsibility demonstrated by the staff are commendable. They genuinely care for the well-being and growth of every child, making the school a safe and loving place to learn and grow.  Twinklekidz also cultivates a warm and tight-knit community of parents, creating a sense of camaraderie and support. The school premises exude a cozy ambience, maintaining cleanliness and providing delicious and nutritious meals for the children.  Outdoor activities in the well-equipped playground, exercise areas (and even an outdoor water play pool area!) contribute to the physical development of the kids, allowing them to embrace an active and healthy lifestyle.

Thank you Teacher Linda, Mel, Debbie, Liu laoshi, Janice and alll! üíô ‚Ä¶, We've been with this school for the past 10 years for both our kids. The staff have been nothing short of exceptional and consistent over the years. Both our kids had a seemless transition into primary school. Would highly recommend this place to parents looking for a well rounded pre school for your kids., Teachers in this school are very responsible and responsive. They are all equipped with long experience in this field. Really a good environment to grow in, My children are enrolled at Twinklekidz Fidelio and we are incredibly delighted with the level of care that the teachers demonstrate. I love how the school prides itself on its family-like culture and setting. And home-school communication is valued. The teachers are wonderful and although I now have a long commute to drop and pick the kids since we re-located, I have absolutely no regrets and wouldn't think twice about our faith and trust in Twinklekidz Fidelio. Thank you, staff, for all that you do., I switched my child from another school since the beginning of 2020. The Teachers and staff are friendly and kind. School has good protocols in place for morning check-ins and SMM measures are well implemented for the safety of the children. The school also go for the extra mile to organise activities for the children - to encourage a balance between academic and motor developments. Highly recommended., I've made visits to several ""international"" preschools prior to enrolling my girl into TWK when she was 2 years old (she's 5 now) but none of them quite come close to the warm greetings and sincere interactions extended by all the teachers to us parents and the children. The curriculum is relatable and prepares the children well for the local education system. Programmes like phonics are taught well. Music lessons, Art classes and Theatre and Performing Arts  are all included included in the school fees which is a big win for us!!  What makes me most happy is that my girl is happy and she enjoys school so much! 3 years down, she still finds joy in being in class. The literacy based programme introduces the children to quality books from Eric Carle, Julia Donaldson (etc) which the teachers then beautifully extend it into science, English, art and exploratory topics.  I cannot thank TWK enough for being such an amazing yet ""homey"" school. I'm just so glad I chanced upon TWK 3 years back!, Can't think of a better school for my daughter! Four years in she is thriving in this environment and loves going to school. Amazing the things that she learns everyday. The teachers are so attentive and dedicated. Really feels like being part of a very happy family. Highly recommend!, I used to go here for 2 years or so. I cant remember i was young. But i remember a teacher saying to me i can only go to the bathroom once a day which was crazy. I still cant believe that the place was fully remodeled. It was a fun time there  also, is there finally bathroom stalls? cause when i went theres only a divider and nothing else no door even. hope it was improved lol  thank you for the memories, A family oriented centre with nurturing teachers.  Regular updates for parents on children's learning and welfare., Wonderful teachers and excellent teaching for kids"

While my 2 year old son's first couple weeks in playgroup were a transition, now he smiles and laughs whenever I drop him off in the morning. He has made great progress in his first four months. The manager JoJo and her group of teachers do an amazing job. Highly recommended!!!, My son has been with CBP cherie hearts since april 2017. I intentionally dropped by a couple of times to check on the center's teachers as well as to view my son's progession with the infant care center. I noted that the teachers have been very patient and attentive toward the infants. For their thursday music classes, the teachers would specifically arrange for 2 separate sessions so that each music class will not over crowded in order for the children to follow and thoroughly enjoy the music class depending on the infant's ability to keep up with the musical activities. Parents are also kept abreast of the latest activities through news letters as well as the message chits via the child's workbook. In view of mothers day, Cherie hearts recently arranged for both moms and infants to the play dough activity on 12 may 2017 to get parents' participation and involvement with kid's play. It was extremely fun and engaging for us moms and our children. I believed we all had a really smashing time! So, keep up the good work at CBP and continue to keep those communication lines open with us parents. We truly appreciate your efforts! Special thanks to Jojo, teacher Mani and chinese teacher Wei for your care and attentiveness., We‚Äôre grateful that we can found a very nice school for our 2 daughters.

Thank you Twinkle kidz @CBPüëçüëç, Small Nat  Most amazing school you need to enrol your child into. What are you you waiting for, daddies and mummies?!? The programme are holistic. I love the extra effort, the school incorporated into their programme like piano lessons. Through this program, my child knows clearly what she like and dislike. Many parents including me always wanted to send the child to learn musical instruments. But in the end, it might not turn your child into wizard Mozart. Let your child choose their own path, it be much more easier to guide than to strain. CCBP is a small little heart of orchard road with international children. All the little bees gets to expose themselves to different culture and traditional costume. There is so much more the school have done for me and my child that I cannot stop writing. Alas, time have come and I need to sign off. Last and not the least, may the force with Jojo and the Gang. :)  Sincerely, Big Nat, Dear teachers who have taught my daughter, Eva,  Our daughter Eva has had a good time, and thoroughly enjoyed her time with you. Many thanks for your kind care and attention in making her time a joyful one.

They don't have fancy programmes but the teachers made a lot of efforts on my child's development in terms of motor skills, language & literacy and personality. He did many creative art & craft independently at home using the skills learned from school. The kids in his class are all kind and friendly to each other, and they love to play together after school. Love YWCA McNair., Friendly and unpretentious environment, wonderful teachers who really care for the kids. Both my kids talk about what they do in school especially for celebrations.

YWCA West Coast Child Development Centre,"The teachers and Principal are very caring and attentive to the children. There is a lot of efforts put in especially during festive celebrations where the teachers do up the decorations and mascots for the children to enjoy and play. My children always look forward to going to the centre to learn and mingle with their friends, and interact with the teachers. Lessons are made interesting to capture the children attention. They are always having a fun time in school. Auntie always cook up a hearty meal to fill their hungry tummy. At times even bake cake or cookies for their snack time., Special thanks to the teachers of YWCA who has went above and beyond their responsibilities in handling my child. There has been regular updates in child‚Äôs progress and PTM to discuss the future steps in terms of development and attaining goals. Teachers are very humble and soft-spoken. I really feel my child is very safe when he is at school and is given enough care. The app used by the school is quite friendly who gives regular updates on activities along with pictures. Dental check ups are add-ons. Outdoor activities is what I live the most. I would highly recommend YWCA to any parents if they have to start schooling for child.  Cheers.., Teachers and principal are very supportive and caring to the kids. Especially to my special needs boy who needs abit more attention compare to the others.  Love the vibes here too!, YWCA is a very good place for children to learn and grow up. School environment is clean and tidy. There‚Äôre very good team of teachers, and they give children same love and warmth as home., Our kids thoroughly enjoyed going to school since enrolling! There were definitely days where the kiddos threw tantrums and woke up the wrong side of bed; the teachers (and principal) were just fantastic - they managed to calm the children down so effortlessly (of course due to their vast experiences)!  We wanna give a BIG THANK YOU to all the staff at YWCA West Coast for being so ever accommodative, attentive and loving to the children! Each. And. Every. Day. üòçü•∞  Xoxo, Hong Yi & Yu Chen‚Äôs parents, Dear Ms Karen,  Happy Teacher‚Äôs Day! üë©üèª‚Äçüè´üíê  Time sure does fly‚Ä¶ A little over 2 years ago, I arrived at the doorstep of YWCA West Coast not speaking a single word, only wanting to be carried by you‚Ä¶ üôà You had to pat me to nap every afternoon - you still do - and play bumper cars with me each evening. With all your warmth, guidance, and extra-special TLC, you gave me the room to grow up a confident, expressive and sweet young boy! ü•∞  May you always be the shining light to us all and beyond, for we promise to make you proud as the bright future of our country! üá∏üá¨ü§©  With love, Little Sylas, Highly Recommended NOT bring your children to this academy or any YWCA affiliates. Management holds very poor quality in Professionalism and Competent Decision-making. Children are allowed to abuse other children without any form of discipline and/or consequences. When those forms are acted upon rationally by Teachers, they are immediately terminated. Except for other occasions, such as late last year, when a Teacher locked her Student in a closet as punishment. If you think being bullied, tormented and traumatized is the cost of a good education for your child, then YWCA may be the place for you., Teachers here are teaching kids with special needs even if they don't have any background or training in special education. They are also hiring poor quality teachers from other countries., 2 kids with this centre. Comfortable environment with warm and caring teachers and principal., Warm and caring teachers and principal.  Thank you for taking such good care of M ‚ù§Ô∏è, Loving, kind and patient teachers at YWCA West coast. Especially to Ms Karen, Cai Hong Laoshi, Ms Elliane, Teacher Naz, Teshini, Teacher Madelane, Xiao wei laoshi and Cao Laoshi., My twin sons have been studying at YWCA since N2 and are about to graduate from K2 now. They have learned a lot here and their personalities have become much more cheerful. I am very grateful to the teachers and principal here. They are really attentive. in treating every child."
Zee Juniors,If you want your child to have nightmares this is the place for you. Where things happen within closed doors. Very inefficient Teachers who don't make the environment conducive for the child to adjust. Children are shouted at. My child was labelled in spite of going to school for 6months. I have moved him out and he is now very happy. The Teachers are also very happy with him. The early years in ones life can make or brake him. We took the right decision of moving out our precious little one out of this school. He was always crying to go to school. The Teachers had nothing but complaints about the 2 1/2 yr old.
Zee Learning Cove (West Coast),"My Daughter attended Zee learning cove for a short period of time ( 6 months) and we had just arrived from Switzerland, completely different culture, different languages, food etc. She received great care and a lot of warmth and love, and it was a great relief for us to see how well the transition went.  The teachers were structured, attentive and kind. Various and enriching activit√©s were organised throughout our stay there and my daughter had grown a deep bound with the teachers, we sadly had to leave because we moved too far away. I would highly recommend Zee learning cove., The teachers here are so kind and communicative. My daughter loved her time here so much, and looked forward to going to school everyday., Good programme, caring teachers, conducive learning environment"
