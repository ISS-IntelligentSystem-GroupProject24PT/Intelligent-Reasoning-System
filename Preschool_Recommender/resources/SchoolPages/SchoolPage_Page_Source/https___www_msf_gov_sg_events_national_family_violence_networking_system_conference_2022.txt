David has developed the Safe &amp;
    Together™ Model to improve case practice and cross system collaboration in domestic violence cases involving children. He has identified how a perpetrator pattern-based approach can improve our ability to help families and promote the development
    of domestic violence-informed child welfare systems.</p><p>David and the Safe &amp; Together Institute have worked with governments and NGOs in Canada, the US, Australia, Asia and United Kingdom. Through their live training, organisational consulting, e-learning, and Trainer Certification and Partner Agency Program,
    the Safe &amp; Together Institute provides organisations and systems with a wide range of tools to partner with adult and child survivors and intervene with perpetrators. Currently the Institute supports almost 300 Certified Trainers and 80 Partner
    Agencies worldwide. David hopes that his work ends the use of “failure to protect” mentality in domestic violence cases and helps systems better work with complex cases involving mental health issues, substance misuse and domestic violence.
    Recent work with the national Family Court of Australia has brought the same child centered domestic violence lens to custody and access matters. Using an intersectional analysis, the Model is designed to be flexible and relevant across diverse situations.</p><p>David has written or co-written numerous journal articles, book chapters and white papers including his most recent ones on how perpetrator intervention program completion certificates can be dangerous for survivors, and on worker safety in the context
    of domestic violence. He is regularly part of research studies including Professor Cathy Humphreys’ recent series of Australian national research projects on intervening with perpetrators, and complex case practice.</p><p><span style="text-decoration:underline;"><strong>Synopsis of Keynote Address 1</strong></span><strong><br>Intervening with Perpetrators as Parents: Strategies for Child and Adult Survivor Safety &amp; Well-Being</strong></p><p>Attempts to address domestic violence have often ignored the role of the perpetrator as parent. This intervention gap has had significant consequences for adult and child survivors. In this session, David Mandel, the creator of the Safe &amp; Together™
    Model, will outline a perpetrator pattern-based approach and how it helps improve outcomes for adult and child survivors. He will challenge the “myth of the child witness”, offer alternative methods for assessing harm to child functioning
    and outline how to improve partnering with adult survivors.</p><br><img src="https://www.msf.gov.sg/images/default-source/msf-event/emmakatz.jpg?sfvrsn=aa08131d_3" alt="EmmaKatz" width="175px"><p><strong><span style="text-decoration:underline;">Keynote Address 2</span><br>Dr Emma Katz</strong><br>Senior Lecturer, Liverpool Hope University<br>Author of Coercive Control in Children’s and Mothers’ Lives<br><a href="https://www.msf.gov.sg/docs/default-source/msf-event/dr-emma-katz---keynote-address-2.pdf?sfvrsn=3bb30dbc_3">Dr Emma Katz - Keynote Address 2.pdf</a></p><p>Dr Emma Katz, Ph.D., is an internationally renowned expert in family violence and coercive control, whose work has influenced legislation in the UK and globally. Coercive control is a form of domestic abuse where perpetrators use a pattern of threats,
    intimation and abuse to control and dominate their partner and children, depriving them of independence and isolating them from support. Because coercive control does not always involve physicalviolence, it has often been under-reported and under-recognised.</p><p>Emma’sresearch with mothers and children who have su rvived coercive control has transformed understandings of family violence. Children’s experiences of coercive control were largely invisible prior to Emma’s work, which found that
    children were affected by many forms of abuse inherent to coercive control, including imprisonment, deprivation of resources, constrained behaviour and isolation from the outside world.</p><p>Emma’s book, <em>Coercive Control in Children’s and Mothers’ Lives</em> (2022, Oxford University Press) is described as a ‘pioneering work’ that ‘will change how we understand and response to children’s experience
    of domestic abuse’ (Evan Stark, Professor Emeritus, Rutgers University).</p><p><span style="text-decoration:underline;"><strong>Synopsis of Keynote Address 2</strong></span><strong><br>Coercive control perpetrators and the harms they cause in families</strong></p><p>This presentation will examine coercive control, a severe form of abuse in relationships and families, where the person causing harm attacks the survivor’s freedom, autonomy, and sense of self. Coercive control involves situations where the person
    causing harm subjects their partner or family member to persistent, wide-ranging controlling behaviour over a long period of time and makes it clear that standing up for themselves against this highly controlling behaviour will be punished. By relentlessly
    punishing the survivor for non-compliance, the person causing harm intends to demoralise and terrorise the survivor into a state of permanent obedience and submissiveness. Much family violence is coercive-control-based, and coercive control can occur
    with or without physical violence.</p><p>The presentation will also highlight the multiple ways that coercive control harms children. Drawing on key research, the presentation will explore how persons who cause harm in these contexts (usually the children's fathers or father figures) not only
    directly harm and restrict children’s lives; they also disrupt children’s healthy development and ties to their communities. By turning our attention to how harmful these behaviours are and what the intentions and strategies of coercive
    controllers are, we can begin to develop effective solutions to these hidden and destructive types of abuse.</p><br><h3>Speakers - Concurrent Workshops 1</h3><p><span style="text-decoration:underline;"><strong>Engaging Men in Promoting Safety and Beyond for their Loved Ones</strong></span><br><em>By Thye Hua Kwan Family Service Centre (THKFSC)<br><a href="https://www.msf.gov.sg/docs/default-source/msf-event/thk---fv-symposium-workshop.pdf?sfvrsn=e70e4b4a_3">THK - FV Symposium Workshop.pdf</a></em>

While many agree that direct intervention on the men who caused hurt (MWCH) is one of the most effective ways to ensure
    both the women and children’s safety, this unfortunately does not always happen.</p><p>This workshop attempts to understand and address some of the concerns that the helping professionals may have when engaging MWCH. We will hear directly about two men’s experiences, one engaged by the professionals while the other was not. By the
    end of the workshop, participants will learn about tools to engage MWCH, to help to ensure women and children’s safety.</p><br><p><span style="text-decoration:underline;"><strong>Unpacking Adult-Entrenched Dependency</strong></span><br><em>By Care Corner Project StART (CCPS)<br><a href="https://www.msf.gov.sg/docs/default-source/msf-event/ccps---unpacking-aeda.pdf?sfvrsn=7de8018b_3">CCPS - Unpacking AEDA.pdf</a></em></p><p><img src="https://www.msf.gov.sg/images/default-source/msf-event/kristinelam.jpg?sfvrsn=e82fdb81_3" width="175px" alt="kristinelam"></p><p style="text-decoration:underline;">Ms Kristine Lam</p><p>Kristine graduated from the National University of Singapore with a Bachelor of Arts degree majoring in Social Work in 2012.

Having a keen interest in working directly with individuals and families, she decided to
    pursue a career in social work and started out at CCPS. In her work, Siong Yee has supported many families experiencing family violence in direct case management and one of her core involvements include working with vulnerable older adults experiencing
    abuse and neglect. She will be completing her Post-Graduate Diploma in Social Work at the National University of Singapore in 2023.</p><p style="text-decoration:underline;"><strong>Synopsis</strong></p><p>In 2017, CCPS observed a new trend where parents were reporting abuse by their adult children who were unable and/or unwilling to be launched into adulthood. A dedicated team was set up to understand the dynamics and nuances within these families that
    differentiated them from other family violence dynamics. Using both international research findings and ground experience, the team created a differentiated approach in managing families that presented with Adult Entrenched Dependency (AED). CCPS
    has also conducted a group work program in 2019 to support parents experiencing abuse from their adult children.</p><p>AED is a chronic and systemic family dynamics where the adult offspring is dependent on the parent to provide age-inappropriate services (Lebowitz, Dolberger, Nortov and Omer, 2012) [1]</p><p>AED is a concern in family violence practice as the dynamics can escalate to violence towards the parent when the parent does not accommodate the adult child’s dependency. To mitigate risk of violence, the parent may resort to accommodating the
    adult child. Over time, it forms a vicious cycle where the adult child threatens to use or uses violence to get what they want, and the parent uses accommodating behaviour to reduce the chances of recurrence of violence. This sustains the AED dynamics.</p><p>Like all family violence dynamics, focusing on safety alone usually only manages the risk for a short period of time. Thus, a more robust and comprehensive practice modality that deals with what sustains the dynamic is needed to achieve longer term safety
    for the families. This workshop will address how to assess an AED dynamic, some of the challenges in supporting families experiencing AED, and how to work with such families to achieve longer term safety.</p><p style="font-size:16px;">[1] Lebowitz, E.

    Award in 2012.</p><p style="text-decoration:underline;"><strong>Synopsis</strong></p><p>A Narrative Approach privileges the stories of persons and communities, via a respectful non-blaming approach, where people are centered as experts in their own lives. This stance can prove challenging when working with men who have abused, where practitioners
    are required to take an ethical stance against violence. Influenced by feminist approaches, Narrative therapy acknowledges the discourses of stereotypical masculine and feminine roles as aspects that need to be reflected on during therapeutic work.</p><p>This workshop discusses strategies influenced by Narrative theory, where practitioners support men in uncovering the operations of power and control, where the man’s expertise is acknowledged.

A social worker by profession, she counts it her privilege to have worked alongside individuals, families and community partners in the management of interpersonal and family
    violence since PAVE’s inception in 1999.</p><p>She has more than three decades of experience supporting multi-stressed families, providing individual counselling, facilitating men’s groups, providing training on the issue of family violence to various professionals such as the police, social
    service practitioners, medical personnel, grassroots leaders and educators. She also co-authored PAVE’s publication “Engaging Men Who Abuse”.</p><p style="text-decoration:underline;"><strong>Synopsis</strong></p><p>“PAVE’d My Path” was the title of a reflection piece written by one man after he had gone through the men’s programme and worked alongside social workers in reintegrating with his family. This workshop draws inspiration from our
    work with men who abuse and how it has morphed through the years.</p><p>The philosophy has remained the same: using power and coercive control and challenging abusive beliefs as our central focus in facilitating men’s change. This also includes the simultaneous engagement of the spouse, children and the family ecology.
    However, added layers of evidence-based knowledge and practices have definitely strengthened our practice with men who abuse in a holistic manner. This workshop will explore what we have learnt from engaging men who abuse, and their family, and if
    we are paving the right path with them.</p><p><span style="text-decoration:underline;"><strong>Understanding Intrafamilial Sexual and Physical Violence and how Social Systems can Support Perpetrators and Victims in the Community</strong></span><br><em>By PAVE Integrated Services for Individual and Family Protection Specialist Centre (ISIFPSC)<br><a href="https://www.msf.gov.sg/docs/default-source/msf-event/singapore-prison-service---intrafamilial-sexual-violence.pdf?sfvrsn=c521fc0d_3">Singapore Prison Service - Intrafamilial Sexual Violence.pdf</a></em></p><p><strong>Speakers</strong></p><p><img src="https://www.msf.gov.sg/images/default-source/msf-event/arvina.jpg?sfvrsn=b9e6f3fc_3" width="175px" alt="arvina"></p><p style="text-decoration:underline;">Ms Arvina Manon</p><p>Arvina holds a Master of Science in Clinical Forensic Psychology and is a Lead Psychologist with the SPS.

These types of violence can have a serious impact on individuals, families and communities, and can
    inflict physical injury and psychological harm. Some of these effects can be long-lasting and can affect future generations. Hence, collaborative efforts between professionals from the criminal justice system and community agencies is essential to
    help families navigate the profound impact of FV. Areas of collaboration can include rehabilitation with the person causing harm, trauma-care for the survivor(s) and reparation of relationships (if there is safety).
</p><p>This workshop by the SPS psychologists will focus on understanding intrafamilial sexual offending, examine how risk factors that contribute to intrafamilial sexual offending can be addressed, while strengthening factors that contribute to the desistance
    of persons causing harm. We will also share our approach for working with offenders who commit physical family violence. Importantly, the aim is to create opportunities for collaboration between the criminal justice system and community agencies when
    delving into treatment considerations and management strategies for working with persons causing harm (physical and sexual violence) and supporting families in the community.</p><br><p><span style="text-decoration:underline;"><strong>Beyond Safety – to Restoration</strong></span><br><em>By Lutheran Community Care Services (LCCS) and Society Against Family Violence (SAFV)<br><a href="https://www.msf.gov.sg/docs/default-source/msf-event/nfvns-lccs-safv---beyond-safety-_-to-restoration-(1).pdf?sfvrsn=b28be7b4_3">NFVNS LCCS &amp; SAFV - Beyond Safety _ to Restoration (1).pdf</a></em></p><p><img src="https://www.msf.gov.sg/images/default-source/msf-event/deborahwan.jpg?sfvrsn=f67ef8e_3" width="175px" alt="DeborahWan"></p><p style="text-decoration:underline;">Ms Deborah Wan</p><p>Deborah Wan is a Senior Counsellor at LCCS and a member of the SAFV.

She had obtained a Master’s in Social Science (Community Service Management) from the University of Wales, Swansea and a Bachelor in Social Science (Hons) in Social Work from the National University of

She is currently pursuing a Master in Restorative Justice from the Vermont Law School, USA.</p><p style="text-decoration:underline;"><strong>Synopsis</strong></p><p>This workshop attempts to offer a restorative justice approach to journey with persons using and affected by family violence. Anchored in the concept of shame, restorative justice offers a relational lens to address the issue of family violence. Recognising
    that relationships are complex, restorative justice offers a pathway to restoration of relationships through sharing, respecting power and promoting active responsibility of affected parties. It promotes voice, agency and belongingness through facilitated
    conversations in safe spaces. A restorative justice approach can certainly bridge the gap in practice orientations in the current social service landscape.</p>
