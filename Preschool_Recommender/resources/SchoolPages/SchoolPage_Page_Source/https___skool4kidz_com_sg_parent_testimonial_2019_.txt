<p>Dear Teacher Jasmine,</p>
<p>We have been blessed that you came along to be Lang Wei’s first teacher. We observe his development in his language and behaviour after he attended your class. As parents to a pre-school child, we always hope that our child will be able to play hard, enjoy learning and at the same time learn how to get along with others. Fortunately, Lang Wei is able to obtain all these under your thoughtful and caring guidance. We appreciate the help, patience and sacrifices that you have given to our son. Lang Wei likes you dearly and he think that you are gentle and wonderful. My elder daughter ( P1 this year) always insists to pick up her brother from school. Not once, but repeatedly commented ” I wish I can go to Wei wei school to study!” — this show how much the class has won our heart.</p>
<p>You are an amazing teacher, we wish you joy and happiness. Keep it up the good job and continue to cultivate a fun, loving and caring environment for the kids to play and grow up.</p>

<p>Special shout out to Teacher Sarah who has been with us since March. She’s been paramount in helping me feel at peace going to work, leaving Thad under her care. Thad’s since been loving school, his teachers and classmates alike. He brings home what he’s learnt from school, evident in the way he explores, tries to speaks, becoming an independent &amp; confident toddler. We can’t be grateful enough for his Teachers, Zhou Lao Shi &amp; Su Lao Shi as well as all the Teachers and assistants who’s always been there and trying their best to love and care for the kids. We’ve spent a few days in class with them and cannot imagine the amount of energy and tenacity that’s needed to fulfil their role as Teachers and care givers. We understand then, that this role requires a calling, big love for the kids. We hope your passion for loving and teaching them never fades and that you can find strength &amp; encouragement daily to help you continue in this calling. So here is a very HAPPY TEACHER’S DAY to you! We can’t thank you enough, Superheroes, in our opinion.</p>

Teacher Naw Lah has been taking care of Asher since he was in toddler class. Teacher Naw Lah is a very patient person and understands Asher very well. She is also very gentle and caring towards Asher. As a parent, I can feel the love Teacher Naw Lah is giving to Asher. For example, Asher went for an excursion to OH Farm and did not want to participate in the activities. However, Teacher Naw Lah managed to coax and persuaded Asher to join in the activity.<br>
Teacher Rose is a kind teacher and is very caring. She is concern and takes very good care of Asher. She updates me Asher’s well-being and progress in class. Like Teacher Naw Lah, Teacher Rose is able to persuade Asher in doing things that he is not willing to. For example, Asher does not want to wear shoes from home. Teacher Rose is able to encourage him to put on shoes just in 1 day.<br>
In conclusion, I really am thankful for both teachers. They have made Asher a good child and they have ensured safety in all children at all times. Thank you very much Teacher Naw Lah and Teacher Rose.

<p>Dear Teacher Ezra,</p>
<p>Thank you for caring and always informing us on matters at school about Hannah.<br>
She may be a handful to care for but seems like the dedication she got from school , made her a better listener.</p>
<p>In the earlier days when she first started school, she may not be comfortable as yet with everything around her.<br>
She is new and she is scared , definitely. She bite the kids and bites anyone who she is unhappy with or have done her wrong.<br>
I mean this is part and parcel of life of a kid that is new to the environment.</p>
<p>I know , my Hannah, is a very active child. She is also a smart one.<br>
I believed as days goes by, there is a way to handle her more effectively as she is already disciplined in a way.<br>
She picks up fast and learns quick. Even I am amazed myself at her progress.</p>
<p>Well, your dedication and your never giving up character, helps builds it all in Hannah.<br>
She enjoys school a lot. (But she can never see her mom or she’ll asks to stay home haha)</p>
<p>Thank you for your efforts and being a great teacher to Nur Hannah.<br>
You deserve a pat on the back :) And a thumbs up.</p>

<p>“I love you, Teacher Iqa &amp; Teacher Atiqa!” are the words Aaliyah squeals when we asked how she feels about her teachers.<br>
These words mean a lot to us as it assures us how much she appreciates her teachers’ presence in her life.<br>
It goes to show how these teachers have touched her life beyond the curriculum sessions–she must have felt the emotional warmth from<br>
teachers’ words and embraces. We’d like to express our gratefulness in writing to Teachers Iqa and Atiqa for their sincerity and patience in allowing our daughter the chance to grow and learn well physically, emotionally and mentally. Aaliyah has shared how Teacher Iqa has several times guided her and her friends on how they could be socially and civically responsible towards one another–traits which we find meaningful to be embedded into the hearts of these impressionable young minds.<br>
Finally, thank you for keeping safe the environment that these children are in daily.</p>

<p>I would like to extend my gratitude and appreciation to the form and assistant teachers that have been looking after my children in School4Kidz. These educators deserve a pat on the back not only during this special occasion but 365 days throughout the whole year. My observations may not be comprehensive but I do witness the challenges that these teachers face daily and not only from students but from parents as well. Primarily our children are our main priority. However, aside from that, it must not be forgotten that these teachers are humans and their continuous effort to ensure safety and quality education are cascaded to the students every day needs to be appreciated as well. I have also noticed educators being queried on day to day basis by parents pertaining their children’s well being in school and it is notable that it is not a simple task to convince parents that their children are doing well in school. I have seen great progress in my children in terms of linguistic and mental approach towards their everyday life since receiving a quality education from Skool4Kidz. No doubt improvements can be implemented in this education centre to further heightened the programmes for the students in this school but at the present moment, I will have to commemorate the diligence and efforts from the teachers. I wish the teachers a happy teachers day and continue the dedication towards building the future of our children. Special thanks to Teacher Nabila, Iza, Siti(PG), Siti(N1), Tang Laoshi, Mira, Zila, Ayu and Chitra.</p>

<p>Would like to thanks all teachers involved in taking good care of my daughter since she was in Infant. She was 3 months old and she grew up gracefully as a student in Skool4Kidz. She loves and enjoys herself going to school, and that means a lot that she does have great time in school with her teachers and friends. On the side note, would like to give my two thumbs up to the school team / staff team, including the Principal whom had successfully made Skool4Kidz better compared to it first started in 2014. There were so much of improvement and I know that my daughter will be in good hand when she is in school. Thank you for being my daughter “mothers” when she’s in school. Continue the great effort!</p>

<p>Dear Teacher Lok and Loushu,</p>
<p>It is not easy being a teacher and that too being a pre-school teacher. You not only play a significant role in nurturing young minds but implant the seed in them with good values, moral and behaviour. You have done an awesome job in taking care of them while parents are able to work peacefully knowing that they are in good hands. Thank you for the wonderful care, concern and love for not only my child but for all the children in you class. I would like to take this opportunity to wish you a blessed Teacher’s day : )</p>

<p>My daughter, Isabelle, has started to talk a lot since she attended childcare in April 2019. Once she reaches two years old, she can be very whiny and fussy at times. All the teachers and assistants in this school are very patient and caring! Whenever I pick up my daughter, the teachers, especially ÂîêËÄÅÂ∏àÔºå will inform me automatically if Isabelle slept or pooped which I am really grateful for as my daughter previously suffered from kidney reflux and she needs to attend school at EIPIC in late afternoon due to speech delay. I am also thankful to Teacher Isabella who will not hesitate to teach Isabelle the right way of behaviour instead of whining non stop in class. I made the right choice by putting Isabelle in this school as the educators here are so noble and truly care for the children with love! I also want to thank Principal Eileen for encouraging me not to withdraw Isabelle during the initial months due to frequent sickness and constantly sending us parenting and educational materials.

Thank you of styling her hair everyday with beautiful patterns, she always love that. There is a word that she told me just now, “i love Teacher Mina”.</p>
<p>Hu lao shi – thank you of promoting her to keep speaking Mandarin, i know that it is a difficult challenge due to her reluctance of speaking and learning of this language.
