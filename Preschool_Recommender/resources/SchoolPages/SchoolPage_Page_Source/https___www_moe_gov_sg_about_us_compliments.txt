<h4>Professional and friendly staff</h4>
We were at Bukit Timah Pri’s bookshop to purchase books for our child yesterday. It was a long queue and waited for almost 2 hours in the queue. Thankfully, Ms Yati provided some bench in the canteen and assisted the parents to preorder and arrange for collection today. She was very professional and friendly in handling the queries. Would like to thank her! Happy New Year!

<h4>Putting In Extra Effort</h4>
I would like to send my deepest gratitude to Dr Xu Weibiao of Singapore University of Social Sciences, as he is the best teacher I have met. He is very kind and diligent in his teaching. He put in the extra effort to make sure everyone understands the topic he is teaching before moving off. He even spent his time outside of class to answer our queries.

<h4>Dedicated and Caring Teacher</h4>
I would like to compliment my daughter's form teacher Mrs Rina Tan from Rulang Pri. My daughter was sick recently and on MC for 4 days. Mrs Tan went the extra mile to message me beyond her working hours just to ask about my daughter's condition. It was really nice of her when she should be relaxing at home after her working hours. I really appreciate this sweet gesture of hers. I am thankful that my daughter has such a caring form teacher. Please express my gratitude and appraised her for being such a dedicated and caring teacher. Thank you so much!<br>

<h4>Commendable Teaching Style</h4>
I would like to compliment Ms Seh Yin Mei from Hong Wen School for her personal efforts to send email individually to the pupils in her class (6P) after she marked their works during the recent HBL. She pointed out what the pupils need to read up to understand the subject (Mathematics) and how the mistakes can be avoided.

She teaches her students with lots of passion and integrity, and looks into students' dispute in class and ensure that it is resolved instead of brushing it off.

She has exemplify what it means to be an educator who is not only interested in academic well-being of her students but also goes the extra mile of being a motherly figure in her class. She takes the effort to ask if her students are doing alright both at home and school. On one occasion, she was disciplining my son but after doing that she spent time to explain to him her actions.

<br>

<h4>Getting Through Difficulties in Math</h4>
Mrs Tai from River Valley Pri has been there for me. She has helped me overcome the difficulties I faced and helped me understand more about Math as it was my worst subject. I would not have gotten good grades without her and definitely would not have even pass! Now in secondary school, because of her, I am not struggling with Math. She made me accomplish my goals and her lessons were definitely most enjoyable.<br>
