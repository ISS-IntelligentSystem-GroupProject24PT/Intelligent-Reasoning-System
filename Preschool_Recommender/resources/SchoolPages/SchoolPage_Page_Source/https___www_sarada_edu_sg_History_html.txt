      <h3 class="rtecenter"><span style="COLOR: #000080"><em><strong>“Expansion is

      <h3 class="rteright"><span style="COLOR: #000080"><em><strong>- Swami 
      Vivekananda</strong></em></span></h3>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p><span style="COLOR: #000080; text-align:justify">In the early 1990 when the Mission was 
      exploring possibilities of expanding its community services, the main 
      focus fell on pre-school education. But very preliminary enquiries at the 
      time pointed to an inadequate catchment’s area for a kindergarten. Shortly 
      after, SINDA (Singapore Indian Development Association), deeply concerned 
      about the falling standards of Indian school children, strongly felt the 
      need for a kindergarten to improve pre-school standards.</span></p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p><span style="COLOR: #000080; text-align:justify">In late 1991 SINDA approached the Mission 
      with a request that it start a kindergarten for which, according to its 
      studies, there was a demand. The then President of the Mission was 
      delighted. He set up a pro-tem committee in March 1992 to conduct a 
      feasibility study. In the next few weeks the committee came up with its 
      report which said there was, indeed, a pressing need for a kindergarten. 
      Meanwhile, the Mission headquarters in Belur Math, Kolkata, India, 
      approved the project.</span></p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p><span style="COLOR: #000080; text-align:justify">An idea had conceptualized. Now the task 
      was to translate the idea into reality. A kindergarten committee was 
      formed in June 1992 to implement the project. It decided to run a total of 
      four classes – two each for K1 and K2 – in the academic year 1993. The 
      multi-purpose Sarada Hall was extensively renovated, class rooms and 
      assembly areas were partitioned off, and other facilities 
      assembled.</span></p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p><span style="COLOR: #000080; text-align:justify">At this stage, a start-up grant of $58,000 
      provided by SINDA came in extremely handy. SINDA also gave an annual grant 
      of $25,000 for the first two years to meet the annual operating costs. 
      Bursaries for the training of four teachers were also made 
      available.</span></p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p><span style="COLOR: #000080; text-align:justify">It was decided to name the kindergarten 
      “Ramakrishna Mission Sarada Kindergarten.” Sarada is the consort of Sri 
      Ramakrishna and also the name of Goddess of learning.</span></p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p align="justify"><span style="COLOR: #000080; text-align:justify">Sarada Kindergarten was 
      officially opened on 27 December 1992 by Mr J.Y. Pillay, the then 
      President of SINDA. The kindergarten commenced its first session on 4 
      January 1993 with a total enrolment of one hundred and twenty-six children 
      in four classes – sixty-four in K1 and sixty-two in K2. At the time Sarada 
      was one of the few kindergartens offering Tamil as a second language, a 
      facility appreciated by the Indian community. It may be recalled that till 
      1990, only two of the more than 350 neighbourhood kindergartens offered 
      Tamil as one of the mother tongues available. Subsequently, Mandarin was 
      also offered as a second language and taken advantage of by some 
      children.</span></p>
      <p align="justify">&nbsp;</p>
      <p align="justify"><span style="COLOR: #000080; text-align:justify">A new star was born on the 
      firmament of pre-school education. And the star has shone with increasing 
      luminosity as time passed. Innovations have been the secret of this. A 
      year after the opening of the kindergarten, computer-aided learning was 
      introduced to ensure that the children were well-equipped to meet the 
      demands of the new primary school curriculum.</span></p>
      <p align="justify">&nbsp;</p>
      <p align="justify"><span style="COLOR: #000080; text-align:justify">Come January 1995 – Nursery 
      classes were introduced to meet the growing demand for pre-kg education. 
      The first year’s enrolment was twenty-one children, spread over morning 
      and afternoon classes.</span></p>
      <p align="justify">&nbsp;</p>
      <p align="justify"><span style="COLOR: #000080; text-align:justify">It was now time to take a 
      closer look at Sarada Hall. While it came in extremely handy for a 
      start-up, the committee felt that more spacious premises were needed to 
      meet the growing demands for more places both in the Nursery and the 
      Kindergarten and to ensure the full development of the children’s 
      academic, social and cultural needs.</span></p>
      <p align="justify">&nbsp;</p>
      <p align="justify"><span style="COLOR: #000080; text-align:justify">It was then decided to 
      construct a new building within the campus of the Mission. A special 
      ground-breaking ceremony was held on 27 September 1995 and amidst Vedic 
      chanting and rituals, Swami Gahananandaji, one of Vice-Presidents of the 
      world-wide Ramakrishna Order, laid the foundation stone for the new 
      building.</span></p>
      <p align="justify">&nbsp;</p>
      <p align="justify"><span style="COLOR: #000080; text-align:justify">Construction commenced 
      almost immediately and the work was completed ahead of schedule in 
      November 1996. The building was consecrated on 17 November with the 
      worship of Sri Ramakrishna and Holy Mother Sarada Devi.</span></p>
      <p align="justify">&nbsp;</p>
      <p align="justify"><span style="COLOR: #000080; text-align:justify">The spanking new building 
      was ready to welcome the 1997 intake. This comprised eight classes, three 
      each for Nursery and K1 and two for K2 with a total enrolment of two 
      hundred and fifty-six children – double the 1993 intake of one hundred and 
      twenty-six and the Staff strength was fifteen.</span></p>
      <p align="justify">&nbsp;</p>
      <p align="justify"><span style="COLOR: #000080; text-align:justify">The building was formally 
      declared open on 5 July 1997 by the Hon’ble Dr Tony Tan Keng Yam, Deputy 
      Prime Minister and Minister for Defence, at a well-attended function which 
      also marked the Centenary of the Ramakrishna Mission. Dr Tan praised the 
      Mission’s “commitment and resourcefulness in helping to build a caring and 
      compassionate society in Singapore.”</span></p>
      <p align="justify">&nbsp;</p>
      <p align="justify"><span style="COLOR: #000080; text-align:justify">The building, costing $1.4 
      million, was equipped with a state-of-the-art computer laboratory with 20 
      pcs, a library and a music and movement room.</span></p>
      <p align="justify">&nbsp;</p>
      <p align="justify"><span style="COLOR: #000080">January 1998 saw the student 
      intake increasing to three hundred and seventy-six backed by staff 
      strength of twenty-three. There were six Nursery and K1 classes and four 
      K2.</span></p>
      <p align="justify">&nbsp;</p>
      <p align="justify"><span style="COLOR: #000080; text-align:justify">But even before the building 
      was to undergo a new coat of paint, it was becoming clear that the 
      kindergarten needed more space because of the increasing demand for places 
      from parents anxious to give their children a head-start in 
      life.</span></p>
      <p align="justify">&nbsp;</p>
      <p align="justify"><span style="COLOR: #000080; text-align:justify">So plans were afoot to build 
      an extension which would not only add more classrooms but also a gymnasium 
      and language laboratory to supplement existing facilities. Additionally, 
      the extension was also to house the Mission’s “Wings Counselling Centre” 
      operating from Sarada Hall.</span></p>
      <p align="justify">&nbsp;</p>
      <p align="justify"><span style="COLOR: #000080; text-align:justify">Construction of the $1.6 
      million extension started on 27 May 2001 by laying foundation stone by the 
      President of the Ramakrishna Mission Singapore and was completed in April 
      2002. The consecration ceremony of the building was held on 26 May 2002 
      and</span></p>
      <p align="justify">&nbsp;</p>
      <p align="justify"><span style="COLOR: #000080; text-align:justify">With the new building 
      pressed into service, the July intake saw the student population scaling 
      another high with a total of four hundred and forty-two in twenty classes 
      – eight each for Nursery and K1 and four for K2. The Staff strength 
      increased to twenty-eight.</span></p>
      <p align="justify">&nbsp;</p>
      <p align="justify"><span style="COLOR: #000080; text-align:justify">The official opening of this 
      building was done by RADM. Teo Chee Hean, Mi</span><span style="COLOR: #000080">nister of Education and Second Minister for Defence 
      on 19 October 2001.</span></p>
      <p align="justify">&nbsp;</p>
      <p align="justify"><span style="COLOR: #000080">From January 2002 we have 
      about five hundred children in 22 classes – eight each for Nursery and K1 
      and six for K2 with the staff strength of thirty-three.</span></p>
      <p align="justify">&nbsp;</p>
      <p align="justify"><span style="COLOR: #000080; text-align:justify">Though only a decade old, 
      some </span><span style="COLOR: #000080">educationists describe Sarada as 
      a “model.” Whatever that be, it has managed to keep itself in the 
      forefront by a conscious policy of continuous review, evaluation and 
      modification of its curriculum and teaching techniques. It has also been 
      sharing experience through mutual visits with other 
      kindergartens.</span></p></td>
